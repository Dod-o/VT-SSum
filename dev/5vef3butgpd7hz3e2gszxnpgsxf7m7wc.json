            "So if you win 270 electoral votes you win the election.",

            "So what you try to do is you try to figure out what are the states that have a chance of switching, which is pretty much.",
            "What are the states that are closest to 50% on either side and focus on those states to try to switch people over there and the goal is it to again win that those states by 80%.",
            "The goal is to win it by a smaller margin as you can, because if you do end up getting 60% in that state, you have wasted resources that you could have spent somewhere else and you would have lost.",
            "You would have won that state, so the overall if you think about the mathematical problem is you're sort of maximizing your probability.",

            "It's not to win 80% in a particular state, it's not doing more states at Boston, but not to win more votes.",
            "It's very much focused on trying to increase your probability of at least winning winning these words so the way we thought about these elections was when we would get some sort of resources, mostly money, right?",

            "Where is the best place to put that dollar?",
            "Where does that increase my chances of increasing this probability to most I would put it, put it there.",

            "That is kind of around 50%, so it's one of those.",

            "So basically.",
            "There are about 8 to 10 states that people focus on.",
            "In those states are sort of Florida, Virginia, New Hampshire, which is kind of close to Boston.",

            "Wisconsin becomes important for different reasons and at some point Michigan might have been important because Romney was from there, but they sort of go away.",
            "So at any given point, there's a priority of states that we think we have a chance of winning the maximizer probability, and we sort of keep updating that number.",
            "Now if you take a big state like Florida, if you have a little bit of money and you put it in Florida, it might have an impact.",
            "Turns out Florida's big, which means it has.",
            "Huge number of electoral votes, so if you in Florida you have a really good chance of winning the election.",

            "It's very widespread, so putting money in there means you have to either put a lot of people there you have to do a lot of ads and they all cost a lot of money.",
            "So if you only get a little bit of extra money and you put it in Florida, it doesn't change anything for Florida.",
            "So you had to put in a large amount of money to change anything.",
            "But if you change it you have a big impact as opposed to if you have places like Iowa.",
            "New Hampshire, which are small and you can take a little bit of money and make a big difference.",
            "But the impact may not be as big because if you win six more votes it may not matter too much.",
            "So you gonna have to do this optimization which is at the high level.",
            "What we were going to do is how do we allocate our resources based on our likelihood of winning a particular state at any given point and the likelihood of winning the election given if we win that state.",
            "So, given that high level allocation, the next level down was trying to figure out how do we get these votes for trying to get?",
            "You know, we're trying to get actual votes eventually.",

            "Then we might know something more about them.",
            "So often we would just know their email address and that doesn't really help us connect them to anything.",
            "But if they if they filled out more forms and told us you know more things, we could say this person in our email list and we can have that data and then another thing that we had data about was sort of polling data, which polling is basically you.",

            "Then you have these people right where these people are people who are Romney supporters and they are very likely to vote.",

            "We can follow the same procedure.",
            "In this model, you can't go and ask people are you persuade aghbal and then you know get some data and then build a model that doesn't really work.",
            "So there's no list of these people you can talk to them.",
            "You can't sort of collect the sample training data.",
            "So what you're kind of, what you have to do, what we did was we did experiments where we did some polling at some point in time, and we ask people who were there supporting and then we sent volunteers to actually persuade them.",
            "We asked him to tell them about the different policies by Obama was a good choice.",
            "So actually persuasion I was it would happen in in the real world and then so we pulled people for sample.",
            "We kept as a control group.",
            "And persuaded some number of people.",
            "And then we pulled people again a different subset to see how many people, what kind of people have increased their support.",
            "How many or kind of people have kept it the same and what kind of people came down.",
            "And based on that we could build a model that predicted in order basically predicted the probability of people getting persuaded as a result of that conversation or those set of conversations.",
            "So we could take that and score everybody else in the country.",
            "With that model and now we have a sort of a ranked list of people from the top who are the most persuade aghbal to the bottom where the least persuaded.",
            "So in a state where we're spending a lot of money on persuading people, we'd go from the top of the list and go further down in a state where we're not spending too much money, we sort of stayed towards the top, so that's how we would take our resource allocation decisions and get implement them at an individual level.",

            "If you sort of send them an email every second, they're going to go away, so you sort of see this behavior after our when we're doing our experiments, we had to convince people who were writing these emails to write more emails.",
            "That was work for them, so they were.",
            "Not necessarily happy, but they said, OK, well, you know after some convincing, but we never got to this point.",
            "We kept on going this way and it was.",

            "At that point.",
            "The interesting thing in there was that by sending an extra email a day we were making another about 1516% more money and so if you're raising a billion dollars is a huge number to just completely ignore.",
            "The other interesting thing was that the way you sort of rationally do this calculation is you don't want to send any emails because people will unsubscribe in some way, and so if you can estimate how much they're worth, you can see how much you're losing on this person.",
            "So you can say this person I'm going to lose $300.00, so I here's the cost.",
            "At the same time, you know I can send more emails and some people give more money, so you have to kind of balance.",
            "You know what's the opportunity cost in this case unsubscribe.",
            "And what's the losing money?",
            "So if I can predict how much money I'm gonna lose and balance it with, you know how much extra money I'm making and then people who unsubscribing?",
            "I can always get more people like them so I can re acquire people like that, but it cost me money as well to get more people.",
            "So what we found was sort of an incremental email for incremental unsubscribe on.",
            "During this experiment, we were making another few $100.",
            "And the cost to reacquire somebody was in the 10s of dollars through online ads, so it made perfect sense to sort of let you know.",
            "People unsubscribe and require 10 more of them as long as this kept constant.",
            "So we just started sending more emails and not as much as I would have personally like to because and so less.",
            "And it wasn't that we should send emails all the time, but the lesson was we should test this and figure out where the boundary is as opposed to kind of picking a number.",
            "Staying with that number without having any evidence why we're doing that number and when you push you can at least see that shape and rationally decide where you want to be in that in that curve.",
            "The second experiment that was sort of interesting was that in fund raising we had sort of figured out.",
            "How do we sort of spend a lot of time trying to figure out how much money we ask people?",
            "We would ask people for a cinnamon email saying, hey, give us $12.00 or more.",
            "And people would you know we would have it optimized that to sort of maximize click through an amount of money?",
            "What sort of we found much about four months before the elections?",
            "Doing some building some models on how much to ask for?",
            "So to predict how much they give?",
            "Is it turned out that the amount of money people gave was not just a function of how much you ask them in the email, but when you click on the email you get to actually see?",
            "So the amount of money was not just based on?",
            "On the on.",
            "So let's say email says give me $12.00 or more.",
            "It wasn't.",
            "It was also a function of these numbers over here and the way it sort of typically worked was that intuitively imagine I'm asking you give me $12.00 you click on that link.",
            "You come here and the first amount is 15, right?",
            "So I can go in here and I've been 12.",
            "You can all do that, but people are lazy.",
            "So what they do is up good enough.",

            "Turns out people are lazy, they can still type in 12, but what they do is just close the window and go away.",
            "So what you're trying to do is for each individual based on their historical donation history and stuff.",
            "Predict what's the right amount to ask in the email and what's the right amount to ask over here.",
            "And if you can do that, we found we could increase fund raising by about 1819%.",
            "Man, that was huge because it it really allowed us to sort of, you know, personalize things more and also ask for the right amount that was.",
            "Um?",
            "Did you try personalizing the money?",

            "So we ran.",
            "We looked at a lot of things where we sort of looked at all our emails and be categorized them into some syntactic things like long, short as their button.",
            "There's a picture there and more sort of semantic things like you know, is it?",
            "Attacking Romney or defending against Romney is sort of more positive.",
            "Or is it negative, more factual or emotional appeal, and we thought, well, different people would respond to different kinds of things.",
            "It may be older people like reading long things and younger people like short things and big buttons are better for certain people and short subject lines are better, an attacking is better for certain people and we did build all the models.",
            "Turns out that people a good email was good for everyone in a bad one was bad for everyone.",
            "I was more good for some people than others, but the coefficients were always in the same direction.",
            "There was never.",
            "If you build it for regression model, it was over that.",
            "Oh, along email is really bad for younger people and better good for older people.",
            "It was better for certain people, but everybody sort of moved up.",
            "Everybody move down for certain things and that was a little disappointing because you know you sort of believe in there's a personalization, but it didn't.",
            "It was also the nature of these emails basically became.",
            "Giving you a link so you can give me money.",
            "Right, so it didn't really matter that much.",
            "To some extent.",
            "The content content did matter quite a bit when we were, so when we did personalizing, based on not demographic features.",
            "So when you looked at sort of income and things we just didn't know in many cases, but we knew if they were donors or if they were big donors, which is small donors.",
            "Are there volunteers or if they were subscribed to our email list since the last election?",
            "Order with the new people and they were all respond to different kinds of emails more.",
            "So we use that to do a lot of personalization at that, but we didn't do it on the.",
            "The other thing that we found that was sort of interesting was that one of the experiments we ran was so pretty much every email we sent people.",
            "We asked for money that was sort of an unfortunate necessity because we needed to survive.",
            "And we need to, you know.",
            "But one of the emails we're sending one time.",
            "There was an email that people were sending that was.",
            "Email about Iraq war.",
            "It was saying, you know we are pulling out all the troops they rock.",
            "War is finishing at least at that time, and so I asked him, OK, can you hold out a million people from this email?",
            "Just don't send it to a million people and like, OK, sure, so when we looked at what happened at the week after so people who got that email so that would email had no ask for money.",
            "It was just email telling people something and that was it.",
            "What happened was that in the week.",
            "Two week and a half after that the people who got that email were much more likely to give money in the week and a half.",
            "After that, then people who didn't get that email so it was an interesting effect of telling them something.",
            "Sort of, you know, a nice feel, good email that sort of without asking for money and then following up with money, money, money, money, money as they are getting had this result of getting them being more sensitive to that and giving more money.",
            "Now we didn't really test sort of that effect, only lasted for about a week and after that everybody was equal.",
            "Didn't really matter.",
            "There are also some sort of bad experiments that there was an experiment, but somebody ran.",
            "That was that was during the election.",
            "There was an article that orbits sort of mentioned that Mac users buy more expensive plane tickets.",
            "So somebody in the campaign got really excited about that and said, oh, I'm going to run experiments.",
            "You can ask them for more money, so they went ahead and came back even more exciting to guess what Mac users gave more money.",
            "And so I asked him, what did you ask everybody else for more money to control and no OK, let's do that.",
            "So we asked everybody else for more money and everybody gave more money.",
            "So there's sort of this, you know, pattern of, ask for money and people will give.",
            "Maybe I'll try that.",
            "And so I mean the the interesting so overall kind of the reason for telling other experiments is as often you know, we in a lot of the sort of machine learning world and often sort of build, take some data, build a model and evaluate that model on the data that we have and just stop right.",
            "Look at my graph.",
            "It's pretty.",
            "I get this much accuracy, precision, recall or sorts of things, but that's not that's not evaluation.",
            "That's just sort of model teams good.",
            "Does it actually work in practice?",
            "I have no idea what we often had to do was take this model and push it out in practice to see if it actually works through an experiment.",
            "So, for example, one of the things very simply, that we that we did was.",
            "We were looking at Peoples Facebook pages and looking at pages that they like on Facebook.",
            "Likes and idea was so if I can take all your likes I can see what pages the articles they like.",
            "I can crawl those pages and I can categorize them into categories of sports.",
            "An education or healthcare or energy or different issues actually use one of the work that you guys are going bludgeoned.",
            "And yeah the Dimas classifier for that right so?",
            "And so one of the things we did was we built the model on peoples likes and we could sort of build a profile for each person.",
            "This person, like this is interested in that we could validate the Model T. It's pretty accurate.",
            "Great you know, but that wasn't the validation that our validation was.",
            "We had to then the reason we're building this model was not to see what people like was.",
            "Because if I send a message about this topic, are they more likely to do something about it than other people?",
            "So the experiment we ran was we took an email.",
            "Let's say this was about I think you can remember.",
            "What topic it was actually anymore, but we took an email that was about that topic and we sent it to people who were scored highly by this model for those topics and we send it to a control group which was just random people and people who are scored highly had a higher click through rate on this email and whatever action rate.",
            "And that was sort of validation in the model actually works and is effective at sort of getting people to do things.",
            "'cause often we would build a model.",
            "It would be very accurate.",

            "People had political experience, but some people like me had.",
            "Nothing, nothing, nothing about politics and we had to pick it up as we went along.",
            "People who came in later had a harder time picking it up so trying to embed them more into the political world so they understand both.",
            "They understand the technical and the data world, but they also need to understand the political world.",
            "So there were lots of these types of things that I think we had said.",
            "We could have done better.",
            "But we won, so everything was fine.",
            "Thanks.",
            "So you mentioned that beginning the experiment where you.",
            "Papa first, then try to convince them to vote for the other side for Obama, and then pull them again and I'm sure there are other experiments were you had to do like 2 measurements with some time passing between the two and then compare them right in that time a lot of exogeneous factors can happen and do you have any genetical general advice on how to compensate for that?",
            "No, I mean, yeah, there's advice is ignore it.",
            "Assume nothing happened.",
            "Assume it happened equally for everybody.",
            "I mean, there were a lot of these things.",
            "There are so many of these things that you can like.",
            "We worried about them, but we good enough was good enough.",
            "Often the second I mean the other thing which I thought you were going to do.",
            "Also as you know.",
            "How, how long does it effect last?",
            "I persuaded them and I asked them a week later.",
            "2 weeks later.",
            "What about a month later?",
            "About two months?",
            "How when should I persuade them?",
            "How often should I persuade them?",
            "How long does it effect last?",
            "Should I be the last one to persuade?",
            "Or the first one to persuade all those things that we have?",
            "No idea?",
            "We sort of just did a one time thing because that's all we could really do at that point and we just moved on from there.",
            "And so I think those are all the things where you need to do a lot of experiments and try to figure out.",
            "What's the impact of if I show you some ad about Obama 14 times and Romney shows at 31 times or 21 times, does it make a difference after 10?",
            "Does it really matter?",
            "Is the first one really matter?",
            "Because once you hit them in the beginning and then they know it has a lasting impact or as a last one you know like all these things are are things that we thought about a lot but we didn't have the time or the resources to really test these things.",
            "So I really don't have any good answer.",
            "Did you gather some data from non digital settings like feedback from volunteers and this sort of stuff to do these experiments?",
            "Also in this settings we did we did something.",
            "Yeah, we did volunteer experiments.",
            "There were just a lot more expensive so we didn't do as many of them, but we did collect data.",
            "So every time a volunteer would have a conversation with the person, they would take notes they would say, you know, support Obama are not supported Bama, or they may define oh this person you thought was this way they would fix the label.",
            "They would say, Oh no, that's not a supporter.",
            "Or they would say oh, this person also wants to help volunteer.",
            "So one of the things we actually did was again, you know, the lot of the people over here marker, then yeah, badge and this tool called antigen.",
            "We use that to basically figure out do the text analysis for the volunteer.",
            "Notes and figured out, oh, these people are interested in volunteering for us or doing data entry for us or knocking on doors so we could then generate a list and give it to the separate set a volunteer.",
            "So we spent a lot of time looking at what feedback we got, understood their feedback, and then try to give sort of react based on that.",
            "The experimental and volunteers were less frequent because they were.",
            "One expensive too hard to do.",
            "And three, we were sort of.",
            "It was often that they were slower than we did in the beginning, but not not as much towards the end.",
            "Hey so the United States has this two party system and um, a series of elections, not just the presidential but also Congress state elections.",
            "How much?",
            "How many resources are shared between them in terms of maybe people marketing money?",
            "And if you believe that in the future team that's doing data mining or data science would be one of those resources.",
            "So there are legal issues with a lot of that.",
            "And so money definitely is not shared.",
            "Because for many many reasons, one is, it's just legally not allowed to transfer money.",
            "There are lots of regulations around it, same for often for people in same for infrastructure.",
            "So the party is the party is the thing that can do all of those things, but the campaign is separate from the party and the Senate campaign is separate from the party and the Congressional campaign is, so there's sort of.",
            "There's some coordination allowed to some coordination allowed.",
            "They can share some of the things I think.",
            "The team that is at the at the party can be shared.",
            "The team that the campaign cannot be shared and it gets into sort of interesting situations where the people at the campaign, their priorities to win the presidential election there, and so if.",
            "There may be situations where you know you have spare time and you can help other people, but if it's at the cost of losing this so you can decide as a larger organization how you do this.",
            "So I think in theory you could build a team that said, and that's what that's what.",
            "Typically, so in 2010 elections in the Congressional and Senate elections, there was a team at the DNC who built a lot of this work that we started building out of, and they were part of the presidential campaign.",
            "Doesn't 12 they moved over to the campaign?",
            "And so there is that team who did that, and there will be another team at the party next election who will do this?",
            "And that is shared, and that's common, but the resources often get to the campaign.",
            "'cause that's where the money comes in, and the money comes into the partner campaign.",
            "So you don't.",
            "That's where you can hire people and do this work.",
            "So it's a messy, messy situation.",
            "Not a question.",
            "Do you know how much money, in percentage of the whole campaign, did your group spent?",
            "Depends on C. I'm trying to think.",
            "Yeah we weren't.",
            "I mean our costs were, you know.",
            "Salaries not very high.",
            "And hardware and software, and so I would.",
            "I would think you know, maybe a percent 2% like that.",
            "Very very small numbers.",
            "Hi, I'm we're talking about a successful campaign here, but isn't this a kind of a failure?",
            "I mean, a commercial commercialization of.",
            "Public decision-making in effect and Congress support isn't at all time low, if I reckon at airline percent.",
            "So isn't this a bit of a.",
            "Short term short term gain for a long term, you're putting it in big effort in order to win this campaign.",
            "Yeah, but maybe next time people may learn may find themselves robbed of money and.",
            "Opportunity.",
            "And may think twice.",
            "About about donating or so I think.",
            "It depends on so the elections that you know we weren't really.",
            "I mean people US is interesting where people donate money to pull presidential campaigns because they feel like they want to have.",
            "They want to be part of this.",
            "It affects them.",
            "They care about it and they and they are passionate about it.",
            "They spend their time, they spend their money because they either they support, they want their candidate to win or they don't want the other person to win.",
            "If they do this and it's very much similar to voting.",
            "Voting is also currency.",
            "Money is slightly more valuable to us because we can do something else with it like this, but I can't really do much other than put it in there.",
            "So if they if they support something and they.",
            "What happens as a result of that is not what they expect it to happen.",
            "They will not support it.",
            "That's kind of how elections then generally work.",
            "So in that way it's a free market where the response cycle isn't short, right?",
            "It takes awhile, but if if some people who decided so let's citizen elections happened, people gave money to that they volunteered.",
            "They voted people who were not who.",
            "Thought, you know that this wasn't worth doing and they don't want to.",
            "Again, they didn't do it again.",
            "Other people who thought they didn't do it before, so we had people who donated for the first time who donated again, who didn't donate again?",
            "An so I don't see it, I mean in different than mean money is always been around in politics and it's going to be around because it's important now you could choose so there's nothing you can do in America called public financing where for the last four months of campaign you can take money from the government for your political campaign.",
            "If you don't raise money yourself and that's a fixed amount you can choose to take it until.",
            "So before Obama, everybody would take that money.",
            "Obama last time too as an 8 was the first person not to take that money and chose to do his own fund raising here.",
            "McCain, who was running against him, chose to take that money and said I'm not doing my own run raising.",
            "This was the first time neither candidate took the public money because they thought they could raise more money through their supporters.",
            "Ann.",
            "So I think there is that option of if you if you don't have supporters you can take public money.",
            "If you think you can raise more money than that.",
            "And it's not just about money.",
            "Having this healthy helps you increase your support and increase your popularity because you're getting more people bought into your campaign, and so I think it helps, but but I think you're absolutely right is if you think that you know if if what you supported isn't what happened, then you should take back your support and that's a choice that people have an so you find out from election to election.",
            "What happens.",
            "Congressional support at a long time, low.",
            "It's always been true.",
            "Pretty much you know it was true before the election.",
            "It's true after that, actually it's going to keep going down and they know people probably support cancer more than this support whatever that means, right?",
            "Any approval ratings?",
            "I have no idea what those numbers mean, but.",
            "A question about languages because I'm working, natural language processing and I wonder if there was any other language involved in data mining other than English.",

            "I mean the only.",
            "In the US, at a large scale, English and Spanish are the only two languages that you.",
            "And we really didn't know Spanish was.",
            "We didn't really do any analysis in Spanish.",
            "You know the reason the way we looked at sort of the Spanish things was more around you know who.",
            "For example, in polling would make phone calls if you only call people in English, you get people who respond in English, so there's a bias polling sample there, so we would call people in Spanish too.",
            "That would get to get more representative sample, but in terms of analysis of language, we don't do anything in Spanish.",
            "Sorry no, I mean yeah, I mean none of the other languages are big enough in the US, among the registered voter population to make it worth the money, you would have to spend on doing it, and the benefit that would come out of that analysis.",
            "OK, let's finish with a long talk I guess was one of the longer but one of the better ones I guess.",
