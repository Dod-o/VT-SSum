            "This is going away in all the others.",
            "But notice that this happens.",
            "Wherever you are on the balloon, so it's not that you are, we are in a strange place in the universe, and everybody is escaping from from us.",
            "It's just that wherever you are on the surface, you will see that.",
            "Galaxies are flying away.",
            "And if you think that if you think a bit more you will also see that this is a bit trickier that the largest is the distance.",

            "The velocity at which.",
            "It flies away from me in going from a small balloon to a larger balloon is larger the farthest away the Galaxy is.",
            "So what I'm saying is that this picture contains exactly this Hubble.",
            "Also, the fact that the velocity is proportional to the distance.",
            "Well, the reason is that.",
