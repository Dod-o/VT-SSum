            "We may have local, native, repository's that are contributing to the results, or me, or we may want to have sparkle endpoints which we can query and get partial query results from or also linked data that is hidden behind HTTP interfaces where we simply send HTTP requests to resolve your eyes and get information about.",

            "And here we have of course a benefit when we're using a Federated setting, because we can use the original data sources as is, and whenever these original sources are.",

            "On the other hand, a drawback of the centralized approach is that it is quite inflexible in terms of datasets, which means when I want to use new datasets, what I have to do is I have to locate the data I have to load the data into the repository, which may take a couple of hours so I will lose some time and need some preparation to start using new data sources, whereas in the Federated approach what I can do I simply tell my Federation layer my sparkle endpoint.",

            "Harder to optimize query.",
            "On the other hand, we also gain optimization opportunities by parallelizing queries or subqueries or delegating requests to the endpoints that do some work for is for us, evaluate partial queries and give us already partial results back, which we then can use in the Federation layer."
