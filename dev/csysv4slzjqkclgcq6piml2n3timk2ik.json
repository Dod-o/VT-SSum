            "You know people communication changes over the time, correct?",
            "So if you want to so you also have.",
            "For many machine learning algorithms such as this one, you have something called online varients of these algorithms, which means that the model is online receiving the data, but then adapts through time.",
            "But he the IT needs to have the labels.",
            "So so if you want to update the model, you need to somehow get the Golden standard labels.",
            "For example, this is a very simple one, so Greece.",
            "The mentioning of Greece was very positive, you know, vacation Sun Islands and so on a couple of years ago, but today.",
            "It's it's a different story, so this is what you were talking about, right?",
            "So it is possible to adopt yes, but it's not without any cost.",
            "But what you were presenting seems to be something extremely savvy to those who are playing around with stocks etc.",
            "Is excuse me if I'm I'm so straightforward.",
            "Misha is there a timeline where you're planning to roll that out and make it available to the great public in order to be acquired?",
            "So definitely yes.",
            "So these are our preliminary results, and it's a kind of a teaser for for everybody here in the room, right?",
            "But we definitely plan to do a proper evaluation with all trying to rule out all the elements of randomness.",
            "Or you know, neutrons or whatever coming from from the space, and we will publish a paper on this definitely.",
