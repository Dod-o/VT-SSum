            "But it's just that we have lots and lots of different avatars and different ways of presenting ourselves.",

            "Place in some kind of hyperspace or something like that.",

            "Suppose suppose we're doing so I'm sitting in like New York and I have a video conference with some people in Frankfurt.",
            "And then I authorize something that's illegal in Frankfurt.",
            "It's no defense to say that I was I was participating from New York and I didn't break a German law.",
            "Because in a certain sense I was participating in this event that took place in Frankfurt.",
            "Right?",
            "So where was where was I?",
            "Was I in New York?",
            "Was I in Frankfurt?",
            "And, well, I was in both places.",
            "Turns out you can do that.",
            "You can be two places at once.",
            "They say you can't, but you can't.",
            "Um, you can probably be in three or four places at once.",
            "You know if you're good.",
            "I know this is a interesting book on the Asian side basketball team with Michael Wired by Nature and was crying since I was trying this scenario in or out of college football with everything included.",
            "Basically commenting publicly quickly.",
            "Timing stays for information solutions.",
            "They want their information everywhere we want to be everywhere within the next moment and all that I've been able to add some more about.",
            "There will stop writing something awful.",
            "So the only thing that we do manage actually this time, like all the rest, will follow with my school enrollment at all times, places and also go back and forth.",
            "Right, so so it's easy to be located in other places, but not so easy to be located in other.",
            "Times.",
            "But it's interesting.",
            "I mean, I hadn't thought about that in the case of a fiction, because obviously most fictions are set in the future or the past.",
            "And you wanna say?",
            "I mean what I wanted to say was, well, what you're in effect doing is saying it's true that such and such will happen.",
            "But you know you have this thing.",
            "I mean, in English, I assume other languages too, where we have this kind of.",
            "Fictional device where if I'm you know if the story is set in the future, I can say OK and then now I do this and now I do that.",
            "Or even if it's a story set in the past right and I say OK. Now I open the door and now I see.",
            "So we use this kind of present tense, indexical, almost like almost like we've been transported into the past or transported into the future.",
            "And.",
            "I. I would need to think about this because it's going to get very subtle and complicated, but.",
            "Maybe it's possible to think that.",
            "That the actual time and place can shift in certain contexts.",
            "That is, in certain fictions it's true that now it is the year.",
            "2015 right?",
            "Uh.",
            "And then do you make that next step and say, well, in a certain context in context of watching a play or context of watching a movie, it suddenly becomes.",
            "The following becomes true in that context quote.",
            "It is now the year 2015.",
            "Um?",
            "That's a possibility.",
            "Anything else?",
            "What?",
            "Turn heater for one second.",

            "I think most people that work in this business think that Second Life.",
            "It's not going to really.",
            "It opened the door to this right, but other other many other places are going to take over, so one of the things that's happening is that more and more these virtual worlds are kind of of the web.",
            "That is, instead of having one outfit in California, host everything each of us are going to have software that allows us to host our own region of of the Metaverse or cyberspace right, and will have communications protocols just like we do for the World Wide Web.",
            "So like I can Co and I can visit your virtual home then I can go over and visit lancos virtual home and we could have rules about you know what I can bring to that space?",

            "You might not right that sort of thing.",
            "A lot of the interesting stuff right now is being done with like flash animation, like 2D stuff, virtual worlds for kids.",
            "So there are these places like Webkinz and Club Penguin that like kids that are like you know 910 eleven years old.",
            "Those are the things that those kids play and those those those things.",
            "They are very successful.",
            "Well what happens when kids are raised in this sort of environment?",
            "Where are they going to take it?",
            "So I think that.",
            "Second, Life was amazing.",
            "It still is amazing.",
            "I think it will last for a long time, but I think it's it's basically done.",
            "It's job here and now.",
            "Now.",
            "Lots of other other worlds are going to take over and I think it's not going to be any one world, but it'll be.",
            "Sort of lots and lots of people building their own corners of.",
            "Of the metaverse.",

            "It's a good question about whether there's more second more sex in Second Life than in First Life.",
            "Yeah, there's definitely.",
            "There's definitely as far as we know, there's more forbidden sex in Second Life.",
            "I, I mean I do these some of the things are reported on, you know, things like, you know the BDSM places and the people that are into dressing up like ponies.",
            "You know the pony play and all that stuff.",
            "And I think part of it is.",
            "I.",
            "Well, many years ago this.",
            "Guy, Timothy Leary.",
            "The the big guru of LSD in the 1960s, Timothy Leary said the first thing you have to do is find the others an what the Internet allows is that all these people with these fetishes can find each other.",
            "And so there aren't that many people that are into pony play in, you know, in reality and there scattered all over.",
            "But if they all hear about Second Life, then all of a sudden you have 4000 people that are into being ponies or you have thousands of people that are into dressing like like animals and and.",
            "The technical word is yiffing, right?",
            "Furries, furries yeah so so I don't.",
            "I don't know if there's more of it, but what happens is you get these aggregations of people, so they're all in one place, and at times it can be really in your face.",
            "And they tend to go to places like Second Life that allow them to create the tools necessary to sort of execute and live out those.",
            "Those kinds of fantasies, other worlds that are not so flexibel, it's harder to build the tools.",
            "It's harder to build the fetishwear so so you know, those worlds aren't as effective as developing this stuff.",
            "It might be.",
            "I mean, it might be you have a freedom to do certain things in Second life that you couldn't do.",
            "In the first or wouldn't do right, because it might be too dangerous, right?",
            "Or it might be too embarrassing, or you might be a a priest, or you might be a politician or something like that, right?",
            "So it for one thing, it allows you anonymity.",
            "An another thing, it allows you a certain degree of safety.",
            "And that is, you're not going to get any venereal disease.",
            "You're not going to wake up with a psycho killer.",
            "If someone starts calling you every day, you could always just log off right and never go back.",
            "Or you could come back with a new character.",
            "So as long as you don't give out your real life information, you're relatively safe and you can pursue these kinds of fantasies.",
            "Just mine.",
            "No, I think the identity goes in both directions.",
            "But which direction did you think it went?",
            "Like no.",
            "But then.",
            "Sure.",
            "I think you can keep information secret from people.",
            "So for example, the editor of the Second Life Herald now is an avatar named Pixeleen Mistral and nobody knows anything about.",
            "Who she is in first life?",
            "I don't know if it is a she, I mean it might be a he.",
            "I don't know how old.",
            "I have some idea about how old, just based on the kinds of knowledge he or she has.",
            "OK.",
            "But I assume that when I'm talking to pixeleen.",
            "Even though I don't know any very much about the real world identity, that is, I'm talking to some person out there in the real world, right?",
            "I'm not talking to the Avatar, I'm talking to the person behind the Avatar or.",
            "I'm let me be more precise that Avatar is the mode of presentation of this person that I'm talking to.",
            "So I think that the identity thing goes in both directions.",
            "Now you can be deceptive, right?",
            "You can deceive someone.",
            "I people typically do this.",
            "They will present themselves as women.",
            "And they'll say they're women in real life, even though they're not OK. That's deception.",
            "But you could also deceive somebody in real life too, right?",
            "So you could deceive someone about your actual sexual orientation.",
            "You can even deceive someone about your gender, right?",
            "Famous cases of this right so?",
            "Mysterious serial killer or.",
            "Investment.",
            "Um?",
            "Well.",
            "I. I don't know.",
            "I mean, I think there are.",
            "For example, it might be supposed there was a priest that you befriended in Second Life, and you didn't know this person was a priest.",
            "You still might get closer to that person than.",
            "Then someone who knew the person in real life.",
            "Right, because this person has certain barriers.",
            "They have certain.",
            "Certain filters and so forth.",
            "And so there's impossible to get to know them, but maybe someone could get to know them better in Second Life so that.",
            "So that actually.",
            "Actually there are are less barriers and you're actually closer to the person.",
            "When speaking to them.",
            "Via the emotive presentation of their avatar in Second Life.",
            "Then via their avatar in the real world where they have to wear the priests, you know, collar and so forth.",
            "Now.",
            "You're frightened.",
            "Because.",
            "Yeah, no, but it's it sounds counter intuitive right?",
            "Because it sounds crazy that you could become closer to someone in a virtual world that in the real world.",
            "But of course, not only is it possible, but I think it probably happens all the time.",
            "I mean, I know lots of people that have gotten married.",
            "First and Second Life, then in their real life, right?",
            "Um?",
            "Anne, it's partly made possible because.",
            "Because some of these avatars are are more effective at communicating about who you are.",
            "So think about it in the real world, you might be overweight, for example, right?",
            "And people might not want to get to know you right away.",
            "So there are all these reasons why people, sort of initially would say.",
            "You know, I wouldn't talk to you right?",
            "But in Second Life, person has the luxury of presenting themselves.",
            "In whatever way they choose, right?",
            "So they might choose to present themselves as like a supermodel.",
            "Or they might present themselves as a as a Martian or something, right?",
            "But whatever they choose, it's like.",
            "There presumably choosing a medium that.",
            "Allows them to affectively communicate something about themselves.",
            "Just like the way you dress.",
            "Right in the first life is just a way in which you can feel comfortable and you can communicate something about yourself and what you're about.",
            "And Secondly.",
            "You're supposed to be 18 years old.",
            "Then they have a.",
            "They have a different region for teenagers.",
            "Marriage.",
            "Super Mario yeah yeah.",
            "Information.",
            "Then you can.",
            "So.",
            "Getting close.",
            "Well, I don't think so.",
            "I think you actually can get closer to people, right?",
            "But it's more like you know, if I had said if I had met this person in a bar, I wouldn't have talked to them, right?",
            "But that's true with a lot of.",
            "Their image.",
            "Present.",
            "No, I don't think that's right either, because.",
            "We all understand in Second life that.",
            "We are creating these avatars that are in better shape than we are, right?",
            "So it's just it's just assumed.",
            "That this is not it can't possibly look this good, right?",
            "Now our.",
            "So we we have an idea of a kind of image that the person would construct.",
            "For communicating in second life.",
            "And then.",
            "Then there's the issue of kind of.",
            "You know, what do they look like really?",
            "But I mean we might be interested in that.",
            "But then we also might be interested in other things, like what is the person interested in?",
            "How does the person think?",
            "And so eventually you might decide the sort of real world physical appearance is not so important, right?",
            "But I got to know this person.",
            "They like to be.",
            "I. Yeah, we do that in real life too so.",
            "Yeah, I think I don't know if it's easier to deceive, but but if you're free to present the image of the person you would like to be, I mean that's also informative, right?",
            "So when we when we interact with people, it's more interesting to know what they want to be than what they are, in a certain sense 'cause you want to know where they're going.",
            "And you want to know what their goals and ambitions and desires are.",
            "So, um, I don't.",
            "I don't think that's bad.",
            "I mean, I think it's entirely possible.",
            "Obviously, to deceive somebody in Second life.",
            "Just as it's entirely possible to deceive them in First life.",
            "Um, it might be more easy to deceive them, right?",
            "But if you have honest players right then, I don't think it's really a problem.",
            "Oh well, eventually you find out, right?",
            "I mean you, I mean what, you assume you can assume that the person is relatively honest.",
            "Right, so I have somebody who I've never been in real life who has.",
            "God powers over over the Second Life Herald and can like completely wipe it out, right?",
            "So what happened?",
            "I mean, acquired a certain degree of trust with this person, right?",
            "Even though I've never met them, so you can win trust by just by communicating in a kind of mediated way computer mediated way.",
            "It doesn't have to be a real life handshake before you trust somebody.",
            "Maybe you can shake somebody's hand and look them straight in the eye and lied about it.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Oh yeah, I I it's.",
            "I mean no doubt they're different dangers and people people can get.",
            "People can get scamed.",
            "Face.",
            "Easy identically, right?",
            "Right?",
            "That's true, I mean, part of it is that anytime you have a new new technology, you'll have people that are unfamiliar with the technology.",
            "And.",
            "Sometimes people when they see something in a new technology, they for some reason it comes to them as the voice of God and they just believe it right and it takes awhile to become cynical.",
            "So.",
            "For awhile people believe everything they read on the Internet, right?",
            "And I'm sure for awhile people believed everything they saw on television.",
            "I don't know if I've heard two stories about the etymology of the English word phony.",
            "PHONEY which means fake 1 version.",
            "Was that it just meant from like someone you talk to on the telephone right?",
            "Because you couldn't 'cause these people would call you and try and scam you out of your money right?",
            "And you know even to this day old people you know you get them on the phone and you can take advantage of them right?",
            "Because oh it's on the phone it must be true right?",
            "The other version though I heard was that it has a much older origin which it can't comes from Phoenician or something.",
            "So I don't know, but but but the yeah, so people come into a new technology and they're not.",
            "They don't know how to read the scammers as well and it's easier to take advantage of them.",
            "And it's probably true that it's more dangerous.",
            "But you get better at it.",
            "I mean, you get better at.",
            "Spotting fakes.",
            "And you get better at.",
            "Telling when people are being genuine with you.",
            "And then after awhile I mean some people I've known in virtual worlds for.",
            "For almost 20 years.",
            "So you.",
            "You can trust them after you know 20 years probably.",
            "As much as anybody you know.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "They've recently cracked down on age play, which is creating avatars that represent children and having sex with them.",
            "Originally they just sort of ignored it, but then some Dutch prosecutor and some.",
            "Actually, the Dutch and the Germans were the one that sort of raised a stink about that.",
            "The thing is, in the United States.",
            "Sort of virtual child porn is not illegal.",
            "It's only it's only illegal if a child was.",
            "Used in the making of the pornography right but other countries, the rules don't break that way.",
            "In Canada, the rules don't break that way, so eventually Linden Lab figured out that this was illegal in almost every country in the world, so they needed to stop allowing it, but there used to be lots and lots.",
            "I mean, there were a lot of that in Second Life a year ago.",
            "Hundreds of people engaged in so-called age play.",
            "Other activities it's not.",
            "It's not clear.",
            "I mean that's the only one that's really that they really clearly clamp down on all the other kinds of activities seem to be tolerated.",
            "Oh well, there are regions where you can't.",
            "You can't.",
            "You can't shoot people, right?",
            "So there's there's only really a couple of regions where you can always kill people.",
            "Yeah, like a region like the Jesse region.",
            "On the other hand, they can shoot you with these weapons that don't kill you, but they can have these push weapons which might kick.",
            "They might push you away and it can be annoying.",
            "And if you if you do that then then people can abuse report you and then then the Lindens will.",
            "Terminate your account, but the problem is it's free to sign up for Second Life, so as long as there are free accounts, people can come in and they can just keep, they can just keep making new accounts in effect.",
            "Any fast?",
            "Last question.",
            "Locker Yeah well people people can people can in certain regions people can script their avatars so that.",
            "As long as you sort of wear a certain attachment you buy into this game where it's possible to have a kind of capture and rape.",
            "Sort of thing and you know if you wanted to include the kill part, that would be easily done.",
            "In fact, there are lots of attachments you can wear that you can like have some kind of vampire role play right where you can.",
            "You know you can be killed through various vampire methods and so forth.",
            "So all of that takes some sort of proactive effort on the part of the users they have to build some sort of device that allows them to be to to engage in that kind of hardcore role play.",
