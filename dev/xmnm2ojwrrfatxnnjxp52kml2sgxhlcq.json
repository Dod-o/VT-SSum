            "I like stupid questions.",
            "We don't in a way, because a lot of these datasets here are linked data wrappers that actually call a sparkle query in the back end, so this could be a different interface to the same data.",

            "So it's based on something similar to what's done here, but what they do is they define the notion of a data set in a different way, which is maybe fair, I'm not sure.",
            "How it works is we would define here dbpedia.org as one website one domain they would say for example E s.dbpedia.org fordbpedia.org.",
            "These are different bubbles.",
            "Now I don't know the exact criteria used for this.",

            "So there's a question of maybe not wanting to shrink the log cloud, for example.",
            "There is a question of trying to.",
            "Yeah I yeah.",
            "Number of triples is very difficult to estimate, but I mean the classic example against that was linked open numbers by Denny and Marcus, where they took any natural number like 5.",
            "They would say what the next natural number was, so they published this.",
            "You could actually continue crawling infinitely all the natural numbers, so there is essentially an potentially unbounded number of triples.",
            "In general, the number of triples I mean there are very large datasets for sure.",
            "Yeah, and there are some datasets that are pretty much exactly what they claim to be.",
            "Others are not accessible for maybe technical reasons, or maybe the data have gone offline, but yeah.",
            "So it's very hard to say.",
