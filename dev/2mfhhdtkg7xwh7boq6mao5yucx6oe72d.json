            "What they did was they set up an incentive structure where offices of technology licensing in the universities.",
            "Now a lot of patenting was encouraged to try and encourage the transfer of the technology out into into the marketplace.",
            "I don't think they thought deeply about the impact that would have on scientific norms or whether it was really congruent with how we act as scientists.",
            "Because it has exactly as you said, distorted things in the sense that now people want to patent.",
            "The scientists want to patent their code completely normal, right?",
            "Doing that, that is what happens in the universities.",
            "But then they can't share it, and so you know.",
            "Then you butt into these issues of well, now you're not reproducible.",
            "And are you really doing science?",
            "If you're not going to explain to other people how you've gotten the results, so that to me, is this something that's an outstanding conflict?",
            "Procedure is.",
            "To wait for year and after that you're going to publish it right on hopefully.",
            "Yeah yeah, hopefully yeah yeah yeah.",
            "So I mean I don't know if it's a year.",
            "These patterns can take awhile, but you do have to hold off for the patent right?",
            "But there I mean so.",
            "That you're raising a good point, which is, you know, even journals who would like to see code and data published will often give you sort of time delays, like make sure you do it after six months or something like this, or they'll give you a year to make you feel more comfortable about putting it out there, or funding requirements may do something like this.",
            "So there is this kind of delay, but I'm not.",
            "I'm not sure that the delay with patents is always as small as a year, yeah?",
            "You think about reproduce reproducibility and things like randomized algorithms, yeah.",
            "Things going on and it's hard to really yeah yeah yeah.",
            "Well well, some of the randomization work if you know the seed or we can still reproduce it right?",
            "But now I understand the spirit of your of your question.",
            "So, so here's an example, which is if you run things on a number of machines like say you have multicore system where you're doing a lot of parallel work.",
            "What's normal over a lot of machines, you'll get some kind of disk failure or something, and this is going to affect your results.",
            "So and this isn't something like I don't have the exact same results.",
            "Scientific method is busted, you know?",
            "So because in that case we have an idea of how like the number of the frequency of machine failure and we can develop some tolerance for whether or not their results are close enough, and so I would hope that with the problems.",
            "And you're right, there are very complex problems that do have randomized elements and it can be difficult to get the exact same number of decimal places matching, but it does also seem reasonable that maybe we could get a handle on this and develop some tolerance levels.",
            "So if you're within a certain threshold.",
            "I mean work like that is underway in simulation with uncertainty quantification and things like this to try and understand when the like you know what these simulation models are actually telling us with some kind of confidence.",
            "So I think I think we can solve that one.",
            "Some people would consider it.",
            "We need to open source code, but just put out the code like take, keep all copyrights and like say you're not allowed to modify the code you're not allowed to distribute the code just just for now, just for keeping purposes.",
            "Yeah yeah, OK, but what do you think about this?",
            "Yeah, I think I think it's unfortunate.",
            "I mean so in some sense.",
            "Well so it gets at this question that actually came up in Gary's talk which is.",
            "So what if you have these 100,000 lines of code and it's very difficult to actually intellectually penetrate what's happening there, so so you can kind of get around some of these issues with cleverly structured testing and things like that and see what the code is doing.",
            "Even if you can't actually read it line by line and in some cases you really can't read it line by line, wouldn't want to.",
            "I remember Stephen Wolfram came and gave a talk before he released Wolfram Alpha at Harvard and people were asking him a lot of questions like where are you going to show us how you get these results in open source your code and how are you actually like choosing what data values you return when we ask Wolfram Alpha question and he was just like you know, I've spent years developing mathematical code and we did it beautifully and commented all and released it all and no one ever looked at it.",
            "And besides it would take years for you to read this anyway, so you know just query our code a little more and then you can see how it works and understand it better so.",
            "So that was his answer for code for data.",
            "His answer was more along the lines of we're doing a good job.",
            "Just trust us.",
            "Comforting but.",
            "But no so, so I think it's just a philosophical issue, and it's Gary was saying in his talk if we're not able to build on each others work, which is one of the core things we do as scientists, it does diminish our contribution to the scientific comments.",
            "I mean, I guess, but the fear that someone else system couldn't take the coach and get something and be faster than team self would be or yeah.",
            "Can we use this for commercial purposes?",
            "Well, people have the same fear about data to like if you if I release my data someone will swoop in and take my next couple of publications.",
            "So maybe I need to bundle my publications field so empirically it seems to be working out that doesn't ordinarily happen like people aren't thinking along the same trajectory as you say.",
            "What happens is you get people who come in and use your code in your data for some completely orthogonal purpose that you didn't even think of.",
            "And then you pick up sort of citations for that, which is the balance that seemed to go the other way.",
            "I think it's just a question of time until scientists realize it.",
            "Study showing this, I mean because I mean if OK so then the goal for researchers to get as many?",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "And citations for each of these publications.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Citation column then see this.",
            "Yeah, so this I think is very important work that it looks like this is going going that way, but but we definitely need more empirical work on it.",
            "But I also want to touch on what you said about the commercial work.",
            "So so to me what we do as you know, publicly subsidized computational scientist is producing a public good.",
            "And but I think.",
            "But there's definitely cases where code has been developed.",
            "I think the history of Matlab shows this too, like we had a lot of Fortran routines that were developed and then.",
            "These are sort of wrapped in a nice GUI and then now you know you know they get license back to the scientific community and so somehow it doesn't seem fair, but on the other hand, if we're really about Attribution, you know maybe that type of development is something that should be happening in proprietary firms and not something that we're restricting.",
            "I feel like you want to.",
            "Yeah.",
            "In one sense, I feel frustrated because my head is a closed source project project and other projects replace it.",
            "On the other hand.",
            "They really brought something to the to the to the scientific world.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, I guess that was possible and you push the PST license like I guess that was possible because all this code mean with public domain it is.",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "So in the example you use with the the data being off by a row, yeah?",
            "That could have been caught by peer review, but obviously the peer reviewers didn't bother to.",
            "Or maybe they couldn't.",
            "Yeah, I agree, yeah.",
            "Yeah so.",
            "Yeah.",
            "What's going on?",
            "A lot of the these cases is kind of like a prisoner still out like anything, and then, like you know me, a lot of the researchers all agree.",
            "But maybe they actually should release a carpet cleaning up.",
            "You have a certain like you know.",
            "Yeah, that's right.",
            "So if you damage yourself.",
            "Submitting work as they're not doing it then you're putting yourself out there.",
            "Let's certainly happening.",
            "That's certainly happy.",
            "Yeah, so that to me that speaks to the incentive system that were under as computational scientists like the code and data release isn't being rewarded in the same way as or isn't considered at this point, looking at the incentive structure as important as an intellectual contribution as the publication of a paper.",
            "Survey like.",
            "What the peoples but the nips and these opinions would be on if a conference required them to submit code.",
            "So I didn't ask them that there is.",
            "There's one conference.",
            "I think it's in database management.",
            "I can look up the reference for you where they did require code submission and they had to get your results for you to actually be able to go to the conference.",
            "And I think they did that one year and they I think they had 17 accepted papers in this track and I think they got all but one.",
            "They just couldn't get the results, just pretty impressive.",
            "And but then the next year I think they made it optional to do the code.",
            "If I'm remembering correctly, but so they've experimented with this kind of thing.",
            "So there I don't, I don't.",
            "I mean the answer.",
            "It's very clear that requiring code release is not the answer, because you can just release a bunch of garbage and then take the box, right?",
            "Like this is something that needs to come up organically.",
            "The computational scientists do want to release the code that underlies, but like you say, there's a collection action problem.",
            "So maybe there's a role for nudges and pushes from thunders or from University committees or whatnot, or journals.",
            "Conferences.",
            "Yes I do.",
            "The question regarding regarding Corporation data and so when we will be developing is Emma data repository actually and we also have the problem that we don't know which lies I mean.",
            "So once data has been put into some Creative Commons or some other work.",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "So.",
            "Is the case, but did the raw data is not copyrightable?",
            "Yeah, well OK.",
            "In America in Europe it's different, so in Europe they actually do have Copyright on raw data, so you're under so these are under jurisdiction.",
            "Does jurisdictional issues?",
            "Yeah, so so one solution that science Commons advocates is because it's confusing with it.",
            "Just let's throw it all under public domain whenever we can, and then you get around these weird original selection and arrangement ownership Copyright.",
            "Residual Copyright that that can appear in data and you can get around these sort of the EU approach, which is putting Copyright on raw data, but I don't know that the dividing line between raw and not raw either.",
            "I mean, it's it's.",
            "It should be difficult anyway.",
            "I mean, for example in I mean OK.",
            "I'm coming from my phonetics.",
            "So if when people like sequence the genome they got all these snippets of DNA and there somehow merged and more likely snippets.",
            "Yeah, some kind of preprocessing and yeah yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, and you also get into these really interesting issues where maybe 20,000 postdocs were involved with this, and how do you cite all these people right in the development of the data set?",
            "So we're definitely moving towards different systems.",
            "OK, let's take one last.",
            "The system has a point that once they have modified the licenses for everything, the GPL is modified.",
            "Yes, yeah.",
            "Please go on.",
            "Point is, they're worried about somebody submitting a code that they don't know.",
            "So what you were thinking you mean, I take your code, put it on my website with the license?",
            "Is that what you mean?",
            "Written this code and I put it in in this business license project and I don't have it, so the dispute there comes down to who does who owns the Copyright on there and if I say I do like some reason other I lift your code like I steal it off your hard drive or what not and I decide to release it and I put say BSD license on it.",
            "All you need to do is establish that I don't even have Copyright on that code and then it doesn't matter what license I put on the copyrights.",
            "Yours, whomever is used it is now in violation.",
            "I guess the point is more, I'm a project somebody because they gave me some coating.",
            "It's Copyright.",
            "It happens not to be.",
            "I get sued.",
            "I might have to pay damages.",
            "I mean had to pay compensations.",
            "At least that's what because you didn't verify the Copyright status of the code before you released it.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So no, that's it.",
            "That's a nice question.",
            "So there's, uh, so there's lots of work that's been done in the artistic realm about this.",
