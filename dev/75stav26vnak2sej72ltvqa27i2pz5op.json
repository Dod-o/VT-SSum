            "So basically what I want to do with this talk.",

            "A lot of possibilities here and in the end you're going to have to consider the cross product of these things, and you're going to have to consider constraints that involve lots.",

            "So when they have objects that involve multiple parts, like the human body, hands, elbows, body, head, they have these these multipart representations called pictorial structures.",
            "These were developed quite a while back, but Huttenlocher's group at Cornell has made these quite popular in recent years.",
            "Due to efficient inference mechanisms, so you can view an offensive formation as a multipart structure where the parts are the players and the object is the formation itself.",
            "So, so why not try to apply pictorial structures, so I'll tell you a little bit about pictorial structures, and then tell you why you can't apply them directly.",
            "So pictorial structure basically is represented in terms of a set of parts.",
            "These are just going to be vertices on a graph, and for people who aren't familiar with.",
            "Graphical models, maybe there are more comfortable with this sort of diagram, but the way they describe these you have a set of parts each part.",
            "So this is for a face.",
            "Each part has a local observation model, so a her observation model and the parts are connected by the Springs or potential functions.",

            "Result in a higher cost for the configuration, So what you want to do is, given your image data is find the least cost configuration for these Pirates in terms of the Springs and for those of you familiar with graphical models, which is probably all of, you will just cut to the chase and say basically what they do they represent they have a pairwise Markov network or or a variant where the nodes represent the parts and what we're trying to do is assign locations or pixel locations to these parts.",
