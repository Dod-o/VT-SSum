            "Do you have any other questions or no?",
            "Yes it could be, but in the area of Tinker Natalia they they decided mostly to just to revegetated and to stabilize because you have also pretty vast areas there which are contaminated mainly with zinc and cadmium.",

            "It takes probably a month or two and then it's very efficient.",

            "But for other kind of metals like zinc, cadmium, lead for let, we don't have a hyperaccumulator sattal you know.",
            "Also for Mercury we have another site in India for example which is heavily contaminated by Mercury.",
            "Mercury goes to the food as well and it's very dangerous because Mathilde Mercury is one of the most toxic substances actually for our body.",

            "As you can see them there they are very small, so you would need years really to.",

            "I don't know from Class B to South power, they would not allow us to have such crops in Sylvania, because as soon as you mentioned genetically modified plants, all will jump on you, you know and be afraid of this kind of organisms that would be released in the environment, you know.",
            "So this is another thing which is which is very problematic.",
            "We could actually engineer the plants that that would have big biomass and big extraction potential.",
            "But it depends whether, let's say the public will allow us to use it.",
