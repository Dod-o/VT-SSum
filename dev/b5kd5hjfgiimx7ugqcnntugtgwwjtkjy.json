            "With a lot of notes about where each node can represent either, basically represent the entity with entity, it basically is the actor in the information network and they are also linked.",
            "Basically the link is to show the relationship between the nodes so.",
            "Associate with with each node of linked there are attributes, right label or weights and the Lincoln carry semantic information.",
            "So you can imagine that this network has other information in it and then we can easily have either homogeneous network.",
            "Basically, when I say homogeneous network means that the node node type the link type, they are all the same.",

            "While I sit here and genius Network means that there are multiple nodes type an link, I'm so if you look at for example like blpi, that basically is a hero genius network because the node can be a publication, can be author can be a value so you can have a different node type and that people also can be connected because they are Co author.",

            "There are very different and fear that certainly is easy to distinguish, right?",

            "So this actually if you think about it, emerged because we are merging slightly different name into one into one note.",

            "OK, so so that's the difference, right?",

            "The 2nd way why is from for Australia the 3rd way?",
