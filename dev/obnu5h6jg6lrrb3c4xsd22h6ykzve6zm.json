            "One popular assumption is that most individuals tries to minimize their efforts to maintain a friendship.",

            "However, there are other researchers that have put forward another another positive, which is the one of the death of distance, which was popularized by Frances Cairncross and the idea here is that the connection costs are not as important in social networks are as in other special networks, and this is because with online communication tools with long distance travel, which is now very cheap, distance is now dead.",

            "So the first work was done in 2005 on the live Journal blogging community, and what there is the researchers have found is that this probability, the probability that two bloggers at distance D are friends, is proportional to D to the minus one plus a certain background probability that basically kicks in only at very high very long distances.",
            "So there seems to be an effective distance, because if you're close to another Blogger you are more likely to become two ads that Blogger as.",
            "As an online connection, another study in 2008 focused on mobile phone communication and what they did is they computed the probability that 2 mobile phone users were interacting with mobile phone users at distance D were interacting and they found out that probability was proportional to the to the minus two.",

            "But there is still an effect, and this may be due to many different reasons.",
