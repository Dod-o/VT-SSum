            "I think what?",
            "Yes, I think perhaps I'm not putting words into your mouth, but I think what you're saying is something I have experienced, which is the danger of misinterpreting that sort of global averaging, which is a legitimate process which I've shown you in sea level, produces a meaningful figure somehow interpreting that as what happens everywhere, and no, not at all.",
            "There are big local differences which need to be taken into account.",
            "What do they say?",
            "Think globally, but act locally?",
            "I I know what you're getting at and but I would.",
            "I wouldn't go along with the assertion that it is invalid to make those aggregations.",
            "I believe that they are.",
            "Significant, but that the significance should not be generalized if you should not, then go backwards.",
            "That's not the point.",
            "I'm sure you could measure the level of that table to a millimeter.",
            "Of course, you could do that.",
            "I mean, I once wrote an article on measuring sea level where I said how difficult it was, and you can't.",
            "It's not like being a physicist with lasers.",
            "You can't do that, but now we're using, but of course the other problem is not the technology, but the natural variability of the thing that you're measuring.",
            "And that's where averaging can be helpful.",
            "But then you have to design your sampling system to take account of that, but that.",
            "I'm just going on, I'll stop.",
            "I have a question on absolute accuracy of measuring the sea level.",

            "You don't ask that the distance between the sensor and the C could be measured with absolute accuracy of.",
            "If I remember correctly, 1 centimeter, then it's still the orbit.",
            "And then you have normally, with polar orbiters, you sample each spot twice a day normally.",
            "So is it possible to get here?",
            "Information of convergences and divergences, that itself, is dynamics of the sea from such a data with quite a high accuracy.",
            "Well, your your question is you started talking about absolute accuracy and now in fact you're talking about relative accuracy.",
            "And can we learn something from change?",
            "So can I just try and answer what I thought was your question in two parts.",
            "The first part in terms of absolute accuracy, of course nothing is absolute, but let's forget that for the mode, except maybe in physics.",
            "But what we have measurements relative to the center of mass of the Earth as reflected in the orbits of the satellites.",
            "And those measurements are of course only as good as the analysis of the satellite of, but they are consistent, and so I'll be very cautious about using the word absolute, but certainly relatively.",
            "Now the next part of your question about variability and relating that to ocean dynamics, for example.",
            "We don't have polar orbiting satellites for altimetry topics.",
            "Poseidon had an angle of, I think, 66 degrees.",
            "Um ER S1.",
            "the European satellite.",
            "And you thought I wouldn't notice.",
            "Goes up to about 81 degrees, but the polar orbiting satellite it doesn't go over this.",
            "It only goes over the pole every 90 minutes.",
            "Of course the Earth is rotating underneath the orbit.",
            "We find that every 10 days you can sample the same bit of ocean with these topics poseiden satellite so you can get synoptic Maps which are showing changes of about 12 centimeter variations, but main ocean signal for these things like the El Nino signal is.",
            "A decimeter, 10 centimeters more, so that can be measured, and that can be seen one of the very interesting things you find is that in the Southern Hemisphere the sea level is about 5 or 10 centimeters higher than in the Northern Hemisphere.",
            "At the end of their summer I mentioned the seasonal cycle, and this shows up very clearly in the satellite altimetry, which sort of answers your question, you shouldn't aggregate those two except, but it shows that they're separate parts.",
            "Behaving in a sensible environmental and physical way.",
            "So yeah, we can do it.",
            "It's good enough and the coverage is about every 10 days.",
            "Imagine having a research ship to do the same thing.",
            "Impossible you would need 1000 research ships for 1000 years, sorry.",
            "Something similar to the previous, yes.",
            "This is like the last cotton coming out.",
            "You have also the coast level rising over the land is rising and the cost Co is part of the land.",
            "Pretty much happens in the places where you have is X large cell surface is yes.",
            "Glacier learning question is what is the definition of the sea level?",
            "Because if you have if you have a coast level rising that I guess means that there is see bottom is also rising somehow right?",
            "And then if you also have a sea level rising then what is the definition of the sea level anyway?",
            "Because if you are measuring the depth of the sea.",
            "Then this is not accurate because the bottom is also moving, and if you're measuring the sea level starting from a point on the coast like we need the weight, yes, yes.",
            "What is the definition of the sealer?",
            "Well nowadays we measure sea level relative to a local benchmark.",
            "This we've been doing for 100 years, 200 years of fixed mark near the gauge in rock solid rock.",
            "Yeah, well, let me let me.",
            "We do that in the in the solid rock and that's that's fine.",
            "But now we can actually measure the movement of the solid rock.",
            "By putting a GPS station on that rock and so we can begin to workout the from the orbit of the satellite and the movement, we can measure that again by averaging over a longer period, because we can measure vertical movement of that rock to a centimeter or more, and trends in this using GPS.",
            "So yes, we can measure but.",
            "If you choose to, you can therefore express all, say level in levels relative to the center of the Earth.",
            "Now you actually when I was listening to your question, I heard something else in the question which is worrying me a bit because yes.",
            "You're right, the seabed will also be rising.",
            "Which means that the volume of the oceans of the world, which probably getting less.",
            "A little and I don't know if you intended this, but it's in the back of my mind now to go back and ask some people about this that the volume of the world's oceans is changing because the seabed is coming up a bit.",
            "So this in turn would feed back into because you know the workout, the level by volume divided by area or something.",
            "So something so it's an interesting question as to whether that is directly responsible for sea level worldwide.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Any specific reason you mentioned that it is very important.",
            "We could write all kinds in there.",
            "Anything valuable hunting through decision making and you gave us an example of your companions.",

            "You mean but geographic areas which are most affected by sea level rise?",
            "No, no, no no.",
            "This is a bigger question, sorry even bigger than sea level.",
            "I mean I could try and paraphrase your question by saying which areas of oceans are most of most interest to decision makers and governments.",
            "And the answer today would be very different from 20 years ago.",
            "I mean, 20 years ago it was exclusively economics shipping.",
