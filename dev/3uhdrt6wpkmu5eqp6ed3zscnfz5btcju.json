            "First of all, I will present motivations for this for this work.",
            "So I've decided to use my laptop here because I'd like to show you a system we've been working on for the last couple of years.",
            "So some of you already know this system.",
            "This is called busy cluster, which is kind of a middleware that allows users to access distributed resources.",
            "Initially it was created for computational HPC resources like high performance computing, clusters for running usual parallel applications developed using MPI and similar.",
            "Systems now.",
            "Obviously this is also GP GPU, so that means general purpose programming COM GPU cards and so on.",
            "However, with time with also added capabilities too.",
            "Do you see commodity servers?",
            "And to this system.",
            "So this basically means that.",
            "And the user can use either.",
            "A web browser or a web service client too.",
            "Access those resources.",
            "And publish services out of.",
            "Actually, out of real applications and also integrate those services into workflow applications.",
            "So let me show you.",
            "Hopefully this will work.",
            "OK.",
            "So what I'm doing right now I'm actually connecting to to the system, which is, which is located in Gdansk, in Poland, on one of our clusters I mean the busy cluster system.",
            "By the way, the system itself.",
            "Yes, this is actually a big Java EE application.",
            "So what we can see, for instance.",
            "So now now we are using so called File Manager to connect to.",
            "To real clusters.",
            "So what what we can see here are actually notes.",
            "Offer real cluster.",
            "And actually real accounts to each this PC cluster user has access to OK.",
            "So basically you can do here everything you would be able to do by connecting to a cluster using SSH.",
            "Anne, what is important is that after you have logged in into the system, you have access to possibly several system accounts or many different resources, so this can be clusters located basically anywhere in the world OK.",
            "So.",
            "Basic functions include basically editing compiling so you can see this is a browser.",
            "I can I can select many many files.",
            "Here I can even use my mouse to to move files from a directory to a directory or from a cluster to cluster.",
            "Or from a cluster to a server and so on.",
            "There's also, there's also a context mining that you can use.",
            "Within the browser you can also and Q.",
            "In executables.",
            "So that means there is also support for some underlying queuing systems like PBS load leveler and and such systems.",
            "Also, what is important as a motivation for this work is that you can basically publish those.",
            "I mean regular applications as services which are then visible obviously to the user who has done it, but also possibly for other busy cluster users to each this user provider has granted some access OK.",
            "So later what you can do with with that is that you can basically combine those services into workflow applications, so I'm not going to do this.",
            "What we can do just just to see if we can load.",
            "A workflow.",
            "So this is stored again on on a server in Poland.",
            "And this basically represents several tasks to which if you click on a task to which several services have been assigned to, and then there are many workload scheduling algorithms that basically select such services to optimize certain criteria.",
            "Answer Basically what I wanted to show you was the motivation.",
            "So what we what we are doing right now we are extending this system also with support for clouds OK?",
            "So the services that I described are basically located somewhere, so the provider.",
            "When you know making those services available basically needs to install them somewhere on a cluster on a server somewhere, and those services are actually run from, there are actually around there.",
            "OK, so that means that you need to upload input data there.",
            "Then execute and download the output data.",
            "This is obviously done automatically.",
            "At.",

        [
            "Now we may want to engage some cloud resources.",
            "Some clouds, either private or public clouds.",
            "So this can be true, especially for infrastructure as a service, OK?",
            "So what we may want to do if we have, let's say, source code of service at our disposal, we may want to.",
            "Book an infrastructure somewhere, then uploaded, compile and run it there and download the results OK?",
            "Furthermore, we may want to try to combine both in, especially in a workflow application, so some services could be run from a location problem provided by the provider, and some others could be, you know, just compile control on the fly.",
            "And the idea of this work is basically how to rank Cloud offers.",
            "So in this in this context, this would be especially important for infrastructures.",
            "But then again we could be more general.",
            "Think about it more generally, how to rank cloud offers.",
            "Is such that we could basically use it in an evaluation for, for instance, workflow management creation or workflow scheduling?",
            "OK, so basically the idea here is to build a quality model that would kind of represent.",
            "Some quality metrics that we want to use in terms of evaluation of either infrastructure, platform or concrete services.",
            "Quality measurement procedures an.",
            "Then obviously develop an evaluation engine.",
            "To rank such offers.",
            "Actually, if you.",
            "If you look close enough, there are systems like that, for instance.",
            "One of such systems is crowd Rado.",
            "You most likely are familiar with such systems.",
            "So basically what you do here, you can even choose here your location like let's say Europe, then this is for infrastructures.",
            "OK, so then you specify your requirements and then you get a list of offers, OK?",
            "Meeting your criteria and sorted in this case by by the price.",
            "So.",
            "Obviously this there are many such comparison engines for basically.",
            "Item that you may want to use in our daily life and we could easily adopt certain techniques to create a ranking for cloud cloud providers.",
            "Cloud offers.",
            "Also, it might be important here.",
            "To look not only at the parameters that are given to you as a client today, I mean the price and the conditions and so on, but possibly to have a look at what the particular provider has offered have been offering over some, sometimes some period of time.",
            "So for instance, if you.",
            "If you come to a conclusion that there there have been, you know dramatic changes in, say, availability of an offer of or reliability or conditions.",
            "This might be an indicator for you that.",

            "Then it might or might not be important for you, OK?",

            "So this is another issue, is the vendor locking problem so?",
            "In this case, we might want such a ranking strategy too.",
            "To prevent from.",
            "You know giving to the first place in this ranking to just one provider.",
            "Obviously you can.",

            "So in this case this solution is planned to.",
            "To consider several best offers.",
            "To prevent from this anyway, it might be good for any client to use possibly more than one provider in case they want to migrate.",

            "The workflow is kind of re evaluated and new services are being selected.",
            "Then there are actually two different execution engines for the workflow applications, so one of them is.",

            "And several other factors.",
            "So we've published actually many papers on that, and as a research platform, it actually, I think, allows us to add anything we want here, you know, compared to the other platform sense, of course.",
            "You know another issue is that although there are many workflow management systems, there is no single standard actually.",
            "This this is affect especially for, you know, representing workflows.",
            "There are some.",
            "Obviously there are some languages like people or something, but this is not everything we want to represent here.",
            "So again this.",
            "This means that if we implement something you know.",
            "Then we can add anything we want, but then again, of course it's possible, for instance, to export such a workflow to people.",
            "And then you may want to use some other solutions to execute it, right?",

            "You can export it, but have you tried importing it in one of the technologies?",
            "Not IBM Sir or not really.",
            "So we basically exported it for the other engine using agents.",
            "OK, so it was done easier to interpret it.",
