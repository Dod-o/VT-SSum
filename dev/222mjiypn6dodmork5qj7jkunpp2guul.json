            "If you can discretize it, then you can apply.",

            "Yes, OK. Yeah no OK fine yes but then so.",
            "But what I would do then?",

            "And for this now, what we are, we are unfortunately only at the computational end, and we have we are developing but very slowly understanding of what can be measured.",
            "And now what we need personally, I mean in our group to do is to reach out to people that make experiments to figure out exactly as you said, what can be measured.",
            "So if you have a cannula insertion, can you measure load?",
            "Can you measure what displacement and can you correlate both?",

            "And are these two mutually exclusive?",
            "Or their do there exist combinations of these two approaches which may be more efficient than the either extreme?",
            "Yes, so I cannot talk in general, but what we my experience is that.",
            "The most successful work that we did was at the intersection between the two.",
            "So for example.",
            "So we worked on model order reduction where we did quite a number of pre calculations.",
            "But these three calculations are done.",
            "In a restricted parameter space, because we cannot predict all the parameter values that we will see.",

            "Basically, instead of having 1,000,000 degrees of freedom, we had five, so it was very fast, but then as soon as you get out of the parameter space that you have pre calculated these solutions are invalid because you cannot predict what will happen outside of that zone that you precomputed.",
            "So in that case you need.",
