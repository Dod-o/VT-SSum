            "It's not something that we're used to on web search, but it's something that's really common on on Twitter.",
            "We also see that the content of the result is really different, so 100% of the result content on a microblog search is present in the result page, whereas on when you're doing a web search, that content that is presented on the result page is more of an advertisement trying to tell you whether the underlying resources actually relevant to what you're looking for or not.",
            "And so you can, so that impacts the way that people interact with the content.",
            "We also see that there's a special emergent try kind of syntactic trends in Twitter, so people use hashtags to indicate topics, and these these things.",
            "These hashtags here, for example Twitter search are hyperlinked an issue is search, and you search themselves when you click on it.",
            "There's another convention also with the at symbol in front of a user name that indicates that you're looking for a person and you click on that and that will bring you to that user's page.",

            "So all of these things work together to try to influence the way that people are going to use microblog search.",
