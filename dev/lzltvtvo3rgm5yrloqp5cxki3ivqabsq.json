            "So it was a massive telescope and you can see a picture on the right there with Justin Bell Burnell in front of the picture.",

            "In the beginning I thought it was something just interference, maybe something reflected by the moon, or maybe some other machinery in the area or whatever.",

            "For example, the position of the source varies according to how the stars move on the Sky, so it must have been something outside of the solar system, just like the stars are.",
            "So.",
