            "Some recommended problems which we have been working on in the context of Yahoo.",
            "And also we would review the current literature in this area and how the current literature in this area is different from what we have been doing at Yahoo.",
            "So both both myself and each and we are research scientists at Yahoo Research and a lot of this material came out of collaborative work that was done very closely with.",
            "Several people in Yahoo applied Sciences, Yahoo Engineering and Yahoo product who have contributed immensely to the ideas that you want to talk about.",
            "So I want to acknowledge everyone before we begin.",
            "So this slide there are no handouts, but the slides are available online.",
            "And if you need a local copy while we're talking for referring back, we have the slides on the USB, so feel free to raise your hand an hour.",
            "So before I begin, let me mention something upfront that there are a lot of technical material on the slides which we will not be able to cover in great detail because it's a 3 hour tutorial.",
            "Probably we need a 6 hour to cover everything in detail, but we put all the material online just for your reference.",

            "And feel free to stop us there.",
            "Any confusion while we're talking so.",
            "Here is the agenda.",
            "Again, as I said, we are going to talk about recommender problem.",
            "So recommender problems let me qualify exactly the kind of recommender problems that are of interest to us here.",
            "So we're going to talk about recommender problems for dynamic time sensitive applications.",
            "So you know all our work.",
            "We're going to assume using, we're going to assume that the item in Ventry, which we're going to recommend from, keeps changing overtime.",
            "It is not exactly what you have in Netflix, for instance, where the items are sticky and you know.",
            "A movie which is 10 year old is still always in the pool.",
            "We are going to talk about applications like news, content, optimization, ad optimization where the Dynamic Articles article pool is dynamic.",
            "Articles are ephemeral, short lifetimes, so it's kind of different from what is done in Netflix.",
            "But as you'll see, a lot of techniques which are used in Netflix can be extended to do a good job on these applications.",
            "So here is roughly a time break up.",
            "We may not strictly adhere to this time breaker, but just a rough idea of how the tutorial will go.",
            "So I will begin with a 20 minute kind of introduction to recommender problems, matchmaking example applications, and then I'm going to talk about what is called offline modeling.",
            "So our modeling is constitutes two different components.",
            "One is called offline modeling, which is what we are all familiar.",
            "We take log data from the past collected through a system build models and use that to predict what's going to be recommended in the field.",
            "But then this will be augmented by what is called online modeling.",
            "So online modeling is exactly where.",
            "The time sensitive and dynamic nature of the system comes in, so if there is a new article about tsunami that gots it gets into your system.",
            "Maybe you did not even have the word tsunami in your offline data, but as soon as the word tsunami comes into the system you should be able to detect it within 5 minutes.",
            "Otherwise user experience is not very good, so that's where the online components play a big role and be Chung is going to talk in great detail about several different things we have developed in this area.",
            "I believe this is something which makes us very different from what has been done in the Netflix context, for instance.",
            "That although there are also other novel components in the offline models which I'm going to talk about, and then I'm going to talk about, I'm going to spend some time talking about how we evaluate recommender systems in practice.",
            "So the simple ways to run an online experiment on a live system, right?",
            "You do an ABA eksperiment?",
            "You take a small fraction of your traffic randomized.",
            "Another fraction of traffic, randomized run the status quo, run the new algorithm, and see how it works.",
            "So that's the best way to do it.",
            "But it is often very expensive to do that.",
            "I mean, if you have 100 different models in mind, you can't run 100 different experiments on a live system.",
            "It's very expensive to do that so.",
            "Are there surrogate metrics which we can use to evaluate our method offline before testing them online?",
            "Now we all know about metrics like root, mean, squared error, precision, recall.",
            "Are they good enough or should we be thinking about something else, so that's going to be the discussion which we are going to come at the end of the talk.",
            "Then finally I'm going to end with some challenges."
        ],
        [
            "OK so here is how we are defining water recommended problem.",
            "So the recommended problem.",
            "In our case the goal is to effectively and proactively learn from user interactions with items that are displayed to maximize some objective.",
            "So what do you do?",
            "I mean so many of the terms would become clear at the end of the tutorial, but let me explain it a high level.",
            "What I mean by that.",
            "So first of all, whenever we're done running a recommender system, you know you're going to be recommending articles to users.",
            "You're going to see how users interact with this article.",
            "For instance, if you recommend some article to user, does the user click or not?",
            "Right?",
            "So that's one one way of.",
            "That's one way user can interact with different articles so.",
            "You look at user interaction based on your recommendation.",
            "You look at the you get feedback from the user to update your models and you keep on enhancing your recommendation.",
            "So that's pretty obvious.",
            "That's what we all know.",
            "Now what do I mean by proactively so proactively means if we figure out that there is an article, for instance, that could be potentially very good, right?",
            "So maybe there is an article which is currently new in the system.",
            "You're not showing it alot of time, so you don't really know whether it's good or not, but.",
            "You know that it has the potential of being very good even if your current recommender algorithm tells you it is suboptimal, you're going to go and show it a few more times to make sure that you're not missing out on a good opportunity.",
            "So that's what I mean by proactively proactively do experiments on the system to figure out what is the best, rather than letting someone else do the experiment for us.",
            "And being passive observers and running learning from data that is collected through passive mode, right?",
            "So we want to do experiments ourselves, inject experiments ourselves, and do the best job we can through both experimentation and model learning.",
            "So this is actually a very key differentiator from what you know about recommender.",
            "Systems based on the literature that exists today.",
            "It's not like Netflix doesn't do that.",
            "They probably also do that, but it's just not out there in the academic literature, and we want to point out that aspect in this tutorial and most of the techniques along those lines would be covered in what which one is going to say in 70 minutes, right?",
            "I would also like to mention the recommended problem is a relatively new scientific subdiscipline.",
            "In fact, the first papers appeared in the 1990s, so it's not an old science, not something that was done in friends since the 50s, and recently after the Netflix competition, it has gained a lot of popularity.",
            "All the new web applications have also put this technique at the forefront of data mining, for instance, so it's a relatively scientific new scientific subdiscipline that involves several different things.",
            "So, first, of course, it involves large scale machine learning statistics and data mining, and.",
            "Again, within that, if you want to be more granular, you can think of offline models as one component to online models with another component, collaborative filtering.",
            "Explore, exploit which beach is going to talk about in more detail.",
            "So explore, exploit is again a method of sampling data in a way which is going to help you maximize your long term objective, and we're going to hear a lot more about that in later multiobjective optimization in the presence of uncertainty.",
            "So that's also very important, so when we are recommending articles, say for a user on a website.",
            "Yes, you may be interested in increasing the click rate, but maybe you can increase the click rate by just showing Britney Spears.",
            "Is that the best objective?",
            "Maybe that's not the best subject.",
            "If you want users to both click on the article and spend a lot of time reading the article.",
            "Right, so there are two different objectives which we want.",
            "We want to optimize simultaneously.",
            "Another scenario is you want your user to click on the article, but at the same time you're concerned about the advertising revenue which accrues due to that click on the landing page, right?",
            "So you say OK, well if I lose a very small amount of clicks by shuffling the articles and that results in high increase in revenue, I'm ready to live with that.",
            "That's another example of multiple objectives that you're trying to optimize.",
            "So again, multiple objective is a way of life and every year.",
            "Running a real recommender system, you would be faced with these challenges and you have to figure out what's the best way to do frame your objective function before you even go to the machine learning part right then of course user understanding right?",
            "If you want to do a good job of recommending articles to user, you better understand everything you can about your users.",
            "For instance, if you are on Yahoo, we know users visit on search engine so we know the kind of queries you issue to our search engines.",
            "We know which websites you go to at Yahoo.",
            "Like for instance, you may be visiting Yahoo Sports every day.",
            "Now I can use that knowledge to do a great job of recommending you articles when you're on the Yahoo.",
            "Front page.",
            "The fact that you like NBA means if I have an NBA article in my inventory.",
            "When you go to the front page I should be recommending that this is something external which you've learned from other data sources and that should be utilized as much as possible.",
            "Item understanding that's again important, right?",
            "So for instance, if you are recommending news articles, you have to understand what the news is about.",
            "Is it about Barack Obama?",
            "So that's like understanding the entities which are there in your article, keyword extraction, topic detection.",
            "These are again very interesting, important things.",
            "If you don't understand things about our items, then it is very difficult to build user profiles right?",
            "So you did something on article.",
            "Now I don't even know what that article is about.",
            "You may not be able to do a great job of building user profile, right?",
            "So that's another.",
            "Important component when we are considering recommender problems, at least the kind of recommended problems we're talking about here."

        [
            "OK.",
            "So again.",
            "Here is a high level flow of how the system may work, so this is again just meant to be a cartoon.",
            "I'm not, you know, I'm not saying this is exactly how the system was just a cartoon to give you a high level idea of how the system may work.",
            "So this could be the flow.",
            "First, what you do is you try to understand whatever you can about your items through offline analysis, right?",
            "So that may involve keyword extraction, entity detection, natural language processing, information retrieval, editorial tagging.",
            "All those things will come there.",
            "Once you wonder, so once you understand everything about your article, So what you have to do is you have to serve items to a user that comes to your website, keeping in mind the objectives which you want to optimize for the application.",
            "Is it only click rates?",
            "Is it a combination of click rate or revenue?",
            "Is it a combination of click create revenue, downstream engagement?",
            "These are decisions which as a business owner you have to make a priority.",
            "Working with machine learning and data mining experts.",
            "Once you start serving articles, you are going to get some feedback from the user right in the form of clicks, dwell time, and things like that.",
            "Your system ideally should be able to use this feedback and update the model as quickly as possible.",
            "The more quickly you react to information, the better your recommender.",
            "You know, take for instance the tsunami example, right?",
            "So if you don't react quickly, user who comes to Yahoo is going to consume that news from New York Times anyway and Yahoo as a portal is not going to look very attractive to the user.",
            "So quick reaction is extremely important for achieving good performance.",
            "We should always strive to enhance our item inventory as much as possible.",
            "The Richard item inventory.",
            "The better the recommendations you can provide, right?",
            "That's again a no brainer.",
            "However, we have to be careful that item inventory is not contaminated by something very bad.",
            "Because all the algorithms you're talking about here are statistical, right?",
            "And by definition, statistical algorithms are going to make errors sometimes.",
            "So if you have something, if you have an article in your pool where a single error can cost you dearly, you don't want those things to be in the article, right?",
            "So maybe you have something like a form and you will start recommending and you may actually drive away users from your portal completely forever.",
            "That's an extremely costly thing and you have to be careful not.",
            "To encourage your system to do that all right, so you may require some business logic editorial oversight to prevent such cases, but at the same time you want to enhance your inventory as much as possible.",
            "Otherwise, you're not going to be able to recommend the best things to the users, and we should always learn from all the interactions the users are having on the items, both from the component you are trying to optimize and elsewhere to increase our understanding about the user.",
            "The more we understand about the user, the better we can recommend, right?",
            "So this is the high level flow."
        ],
        [
            "So here it is again.",
            "Some simple example of water recommender problem may look like if you were actually working for instance for a company like Yahoo or some other company, right?",
            "So a simple version could be as follows.",
            "Someone can come to you and say I have an important module running on my website and I obtained my content in Ventry from say third party source which I further refine through editorial oversight to make sure I don't introduce any bad things into the inventory.",
            "Can I algorithmically recommend content on this module and my goal is to really drive up click through rate on this morning so this is a very simple problem example of a problem which someone can come to you as a data miner and ask you to solve right?",
            "So and in fact in the tutorial this is the only version we're going to focus on today and you will see even this simple version of the problem is not as simple as it sounds right then.",
            "It could be more advanced.",
            "OK, I recommended I applied your algorithm and I got an X percent Cdr lift.",
            "But now I can actually give you additional information.",
            "For instance, I can tell you the revenue that we get after a user clicks on an article and goes to the landing page, because I also know the kind of ads I display that can you help me increase my revenue by sacrificing a small amount of city?",
            "I mean, those are very reasonable request from a person.",
            "So how do we do that?",
            "We're not even going to talk about this today, but I'm just pointing you the problem that may be of great interest.",
            "Research interest in the future.",
            "The third one is even more advanced, so.",

            "I'm running multiple models on the web page, right?",

            "How big is it?",
            "More than once in your Life OK, so now you can see this Yahoo front page is made up of different modules, right?",
            "So on the left hand side you have what are called applications that we recommend to the user.",
            "The user can also add and delete applications, but we also recommend some of these applications based on your.",
            "Based on your clicking history and browse history throughout the Yahoo network, then on the middle you have this module which is called the Today module.",
            "Right, So what happens here is you have four different slots and the item inventory for this particular application is extremely constrained.",
            "It is selected by a set of editors because it's the front page we don't want to drive our users at all.",
            "Very high quality and at any given point of time you have four different stories that are recommended by algorithms.",
            "Again, the stories are very catchy, right?",
            "You know you have very nice images.",
            "You know the titles are very nice, written by humans, good summarization of what it is.",
            "And it will have links to some other website.",
            "Many times the link actually sends you to a Yahoo page itself, right?",
            "So for instance, if you look at this storied miss and you to Yahoo Sports, for instance.",
            "Or you know there might be some other story which may send you to her Yahoo.",
            "Entertainment, for instance.",
            "And on those pages, since they are internal to Yahoo, we know our advertising revenue.",
            "So here and I can solve the problems I talked about first, someone can ask me can you actually optimize the content on this model to maximize CTR?",
            "The second question they can ask is can I sacrifice small amount of Cdr and increase the downstream revenue?",
            "So this is an example of that.",
            "Now if you look at the Yahoo page as a whole right?",
            "So you have the.",
            "We have the application module on here on the right hand side you have something called trending Now, so that actually displays the set of queries that are extremely popular on the search engine.",
            "On the bottom you have the top.",
            "The most popular news on the web, right?",
            "So you have like 4 different modules running on this page.",
            "Of course I left out the ads.",
            "Here we are going to optimize that.",
            "It is what the advertisers paved right so, but you know, once we add the ad it will become even more complex.",
            "So now the question is, can I actually optimize this whole page in a way to make sure users first of all I want?",
            "I want my traffic to grow and not only that I want the people who come to this website to actually be more engaged than what they are today.",
            "So that's the third version of the problem.",
            "We have no idea how to solve that.",
            "But that's the future.",
            "That's the future research.",

            "Because we're going to talk about that later and right.",
            "So again, as I said, the goal here is to recommend packages from a set of articles, right?",
            "So more specifically, we have to pick out four.",
            "You had a question.",
            "Rise.",

            "Yes, right now, but that should not ideally be the case.",
            "Ideally, we should be optimizing all the models simultaneously in a holistic way, right to increase to drive user engagement on the whole page.",
            "Now it's it's not as simple as that as well, right?",
            "'cause let's say you drive user engagement, but in the process what you do is you may reduce your advertising revenue, so that's also not very acceptable.",
            "So it's more complex than what I said.",
            "But let's say if you take the revenue side apart, let's say the problem is holistically optimize everything on this page to drive user engagement.",
            "How are we going to do that?",

            "So the same techniques are also very effective for web applications.",
            "The only thing you have to do is make sure how to deal with the cold start problem in an effective way and there what we have shown is you can.",
            "You can modify the matrix factorization model to include things like regression and topic models on the factors to do a good job of both cold start and warm start.",
            "So that's one high level idea and what we have found is if you fit this model by using techniques like Gibbs sampling, they give you much better results then doing something like optimization techniques right?",
            "So one way people do.",
            "For instance, even in Netflix is you write down the model which we wrote down and then treat that as an optimization problem.",
            "Treat that as an optimization problem in Delta and Theta, and then optimize it.",
            "Now, if you do that by using optimization, technically conjugate gradient, you get inferior results compared to the optimal solutions which we get by using Gibbs sampling.",
