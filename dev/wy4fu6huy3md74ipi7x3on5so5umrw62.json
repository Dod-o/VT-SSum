            "For the deliverable here, yeah.",
            "Early to somewhere to another place.",
            "Yeah and I would like to change.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yep, Yep, that main paradigm for querying is that you always query for for a set of objects which satisfies our criteria, and then for all of those objects you print out certain further things that you like to know.",
            "In our case here, these are the objects, the deliverables and for all of them we have the title lead type this.",
            "DL yeah month.",
            "Public yeah this this?",
            "I mean yeah OK. And yeah exactly and the object that is actually returned by the query is what is in the first row, so this information all that is in one line is always given on the page that is linked here at the beginning of the line.",
            "So I am down, sorry.",
            "First column.",
            "Yes.",
            "And normally it should also be kind of clear from the context.",
            "If you have a table of deliverables with links to deliverable pages, then that's where the data is.",
            "So not if you have another kind of queries that we have is.",
            "Here's a query of all people that currently are entered into the wiki, and again here.",
            "The first is just the article about the person.",
            "And clicking on that.",
            "Here you will get one particular description of one person, and that's where the data actually comes from.",
            "So this end appearing here.",
            "For example.",
            "Any?",
            "Your query that you cannot.",
            "You guys said the values out of the result of the queries running.",
            "Right now I'd say like all the variables from the whatever are postponed for months.",
            "You have to basically go back to each sources to change that, right?",
            "Yeah, the query is generated automatically, so you can't just change the.",
            "You want to have a right back through the views or so to say, yeah.",
            "Airport here yeah?",
            "No, so you can't directly edit the if you press edit here, you will just see the query and not see the object list anymore.",
            "Yeah, yeah, like a dynamic view which you can change and then it propagates back to the data source.",
            "Wolfe basically after that return a set of objects, but.",
            "More than this later or paration that our dividend is return set up again yeah.",
            "This command.",
            "Top of the database.",
            "This it is on top of a database.",
            "It is on top of a database, but there is a level in between, yeah?",
            "Yeah, yeah, the problem is that.",
            "Yep.",
            "I think we should.",
            "Do you wish to take some discussion offline?",
            "Maybe?",
            "Maybe in a nutshell.",
            "The advantage here is that you have.",

            "If I want to add 1 property to every person, say.",
            "Account on Skype or whatever.",
            "Then I just add that and it can appear everywhere.",
            "I like it, so it's not a fixed schema, it's just very flexible way of representing data without any server side customization needed.",
            "So if users perceived that something should be edits they can normally do that in a rather simple way.",
            "Why as a wiki interface I would agree.",
            "This flexibility is the key issue here, but the question I guess from where it was.",
            "Some larger settings, some other disability somehow damages the oh.",
            "Now, I think this is the interface with before the interface for database with SQL interface.",
            "This is another interface where you enter something and it updates the data model.",
            "You enter new field and it changed it made it's expensive.",
            "To change the data model on the fly, but I think it was an interface to yeah.",
            "Becoming more efficient in a in a database that can do this update query.",
            "You can do whatever you want is the complex and you don't have to support it, but we do support whatever SQL supports.",
            "You get all the SQL back end for free.",
            "Yeah, I agree that many things could be done.",
            "Also refers back to performance optimization or using other database specific methods to provide some special functionality.",
            "I think that's one key difference between nice prototype and the working system.",
            "That many things one can easily think of are not done yet because they are not as stable and easy to do and and reliable as we would like them to have here.",
            "But I agree that we are open to most kind of improvements.",
            "One can come up with.",
            "But let me just in the remaining 2 minutes finished my tour here.",
            "So as you saw there are pages about every person and I would really like to edit this now.",
            "'cause then you could see the source code but I won't.",
            "I hope it's mostly self explanatory, at least for somebody with their engineering background.",
            "When you edit it, you will have a number of assignments that define those values here and below that you will find some plain text and so each of you can change the page about oneself and also the page about your organization when you go there you will see all the work packages you are involved in, a deliverables you have to contributor, and what people are involved in the project, and I think we also have a.",
            "List of a timeline list of deliverables you have to submit somewhere, but I'm offline so I can't chose it now.",
            "Yep.",
            "Query for the deliverables.",
            "For example, right, so you would prevent me to fake this very just to enter pure text and to make it appear to.",
            "I'm your for someone who uses page, but it is a valid and proper query to the original data.",
            "So you see consuming their content of such a wiki page is a kind of trust.",
            "If you implies that you are going to sabotage our internal project Wiki, then of course I.",
            "There are ways of stopping people doing malicious things, but of course there are also many malicious things you can do in a wiki which might not be notice directly and exchanging a query for its result in plaintext is probably one of the least malicious things one could do so many other more subtle changes one could make which are hard to detect information.",
            "I can I can see who did it so I can always check when you at the top of each page you have a history link.",
            "Again, it doesn't work because I'm offline, but in this history you will see which.",
            "Oh, maybe I should connect then?",
            "Oh it.",
            "Actually it works.",
            "I'm connected so great.",
            "So you see that Danny was the one changing that, or at least somebody using Denny's account.",
            "So I have some trust set this page.",
            "Information about AFP.",
            "Is is true?",
            "And similar for other things, so you can actually find out who did something, but of course, again, there are many ways of integrating information, not just with semantic queries.",
            "It is possible to embed one page and another page, and thus indirectly change its look or content.",
            "That's that's always the case.",
            "Now finishing just by pressing edit here and looking how how it looks.",
            "Well, that's not too bad, so you have here starting the box that you see on the right is generated by this starting point and it just gives you.",
            "A couple of attributes which are just attribute name equality, attribute value and then some pipe in between sets.",
            "All you need to know about the syntax if you want to change something in that box and otherwise you just go down and look at the text here and you can change whatever you like there and just press safe and it will end up being shown.",
            "It's nice to enter a summary so people know what you did when they look at the history and you can also use a preview in order to be sure that it looks as you want it to look before you save it.",
            "OK.",
            "So that's all if sound.",
            "More question, you have to approach us Danny or me in the in the break.",
            "Maybe anyone said something.",
            "OK.",
            "Put code its own page and like add contact information, especially like phone number, email and or Skype.",
            "If you're using something like that, because this would then be a nice resource where you can just go to have a single point they can contact people.",
            "Second will also be nice a for work packages and classes on like you could add the contact persons or the Rockets leaders and things like this so that we have an overview about this kind of information.",
            "Furthermore, and there is a page for every deliverable, the rules are not very described in the.",
            "Description of work.",
            "As long as you as many go on with working under this point, have an abstract or an overview of what you want to add there, and it would also be fine if you could just put the abstract interests of that that we always have status on how the project is proceeding.",
            "So this is basically like a one stop point where we can discuss a lot of things about the project where we have up-to-date data on it and so on, and all this kind of information.",
            "You can always just create new pages inside with this pretty easy.",
            "But we can discuss certain points about whatever we do in the project, and so we have a place where we can collaboratively working piece of text and come up with ideas.",
            "And so I do set for one work package now, just so everybody knows how to do it, I press edits and there's contact person equality nothing.",
            "And then I in case of of work package one I can enter myself and then I press save and it should show up.",
            "Appropriately, and here I am, and even my email is shown automatically at this point.",
            "Again, said semantic query, but you'd really just have to put your name where you're responsible, and this ones then really simplify our organization because you see who is doing what and who is responsible for what, and even you personally can easily check what you are responsible for and what deadlines you have to meet us all interlinked questions.",
            "So let's say relationship between Vicki Semantic Wiki on one side and professional content management systems maybe?",
            "SharePoint or something.",
            "Which companies would use it yet?",
            "So are they at this?",
            "Is this gap shrinking or it's completely getting diverse?",
            "Or I think many content management systems have also a lot of focus on managing files, contents, shared folders and such things which is not addressed by a wiki really.",
            "On the other hand, I think most of them have no notion of good semantic querying and easy customization as we have.",
            "So it's, uh, well.",
            "Disclaiming that I don't know them in detail, but we should take this discussion offline, I think.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Where is it?",
            "Come on.",
            "Yeah, it's I think we're done.",
            "OK.",
            "So that's the timeline of things we have to do, OK?",
            "Don't ask me again.",
