            "So we can also model the the contribution by the user using the similar kind of graph, except that the notation is different, right?",

            "No, the first model that we would like to try out is the basic model, which basically assign a controversial score to each article.",

            "So whatever dilution you make to know the by a user, that condition is counted the same as any other users deletions now is this the case?",

        [
            "So we move on to propose another model called the controversial rank model, which in short is called the CR model.",

            "So what is this principle?",
            "So in terms of article controversy, we say that article is controversial if it contains more disputes among the non controversial contributors.",

            "Something related to this dispute right now.",
            "If it comes from if the division comes from a very controversial user, then this division may just be just just be some, some maybe just a result of the users behavior, right?",

            "Alright, so similarly we can.",
            "We can define contributor controversy, controversy, right as in the similar manner.",
            "Alright, so we we say that a control contributor is controversial if he or she is engaged in the more in disputes in non controversial article.",
            "So if the article itself is non controversial and user goes in and do the deletion and so that means that this users are controversial, right?",
            "So this is like something similar to pitch Frankel principle, right?",

        [
            "So translating the principle into formula, it will look like this, right?",

            "So this is the formula here.",
            "Basically say there's no instead of the use the earlier basic models right which has the deletions.",

            "Right, and to derive the controversial score of the user, which is the CUSUJ, so see you I is defined as the amount of the deletions that this user is involved and all the articles that he has come across right?",
