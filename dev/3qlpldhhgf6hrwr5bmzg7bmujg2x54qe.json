            "But especially in the in the social Sciences and humanities, so in our field, or at least in linguistics, we saw that sometimes it's a problem actually to verify what others have been doing.",

            "I mean if it's in the clearance center it more easy, but some people just say I did this research and there's data, but you're not getting it and it's a secret I can't share it with anybody.",
            "And then of course I can't reproduce what they have been doing.",

            "So that means they they constantly keep changing, especially in the beginning.",
            "So you collect something is that annotating, then you collect more and you notice annotation scheme is not good enough, so you change it.",
            "And then you need to adapt the old data so the corporate keep changing and they're kind of yeah.",
            "They're not always in MOBA static.",

            "So you can verify the analysis only if you have both the data and the tools in the exact version that the other the other person has been using.",

            "1st for for the data.",
            "So in our experience, this is more specific for our case and probably for some other people, but it at you Rock where I work we have a lot of text based corpora.",
            "And and even if you don't have text based corporate speech corpora often have a large part of annotation.",
            "And usually if you collect speech data, the speech data is not changing anymore, but the annotations are changing.",
            "And that's why we think it's mostly a problem for text that needs to be versioned.",
            "And for that we think, OK, that's already software available.",
            "That versions texts, namely something like this version or Git, or I'm not sure if you're still still a thing and these tools already exist, so you can just put your corpus in a git repository, and then every time you change it, you may commit and then people can basically see what you have been doing and how the corpus has been involving.",
            "Yeah, and to make this all transparent 'cause it doesn't mean that people can actually see it because you couldn't do it on your computer and the idea is that you there are public code hosting sites like GitHub or GitLab and probably also a couple of others and you can just basically submit your data there to make it available and to also make available the version history to the public."

            "Lemma ties are part of speech tagger and whatever else you want to add onto it.",
            "And then you have your very own toolchain that does exactly what you want, but it's like very complicated and you took you probably like weeks to find you know exactly like you want, and then the next person.",
            "Next person will have a lot of problem rebuilding it exactly the same way that you have been doing it.",
            "And then there's additional problem like software is often very volatile, so sometimes the tool that you have been using you just downloaded it somewhere from from GitHub or from from some other code hosting site, and then it's no longer available and the person that wants to reproduce your unit's can't be cause the tool.",
            "They can't easily get the two, or it might not be clear in your in your paper like I have been using this tool, but there are like 3 different version.",
            "There is not clear which version have you actually been using.",
            "And then there's another thing that I actually didn't think about my colleague mentioned, so some manufacturers say, OK, we have this nice tokenizer, and this is the newest version, and there's only this version and all the old versions we can forget about, and they will no longer be available.",
            "And then if you want to reproduce something that someone did two years ago, you basically can't.",
            "And then I had here we had because, like this is the new thing everybody sees in containers.",
            "So we thought that you can just make a container, make a Docker container and basically put the toolchain exactly in there as we use it, and then the 2:10 will be frozen and there will be.",
            "It will be available as long as Docker containers are a thing which I'm not sure, but we'll see, but at least you have something that you can just take and then the tools are exactly.",
            "In the way that they are there in the way that they have been used by you.",
            "And then there's also there's public registries for these containers like Docker Hub, where you can just push it and then people can just grab your container, have all the tools in the same versions and set up that you used, and they can just put your data in there that they got from Git and GitHub, and then they can reproduce exactly what you did and it should actually not be a lot of work.",
            "And then, especially like recently also, there's architect orchestrators came up something like Kubernetes and public coasters for computers, so you can run Docker containers on these on these orchestrators.",
            "Basically on on Google Cloud or on Amazon or on Azure, and you just take the container, post it to one of these hosts.",
            "You don't even have to deal with the installing of the container yourself, you just put it there, and then you put your data there and things happen more or less automatically."

            "So we have version think version 1, version 2003 and then in gate we use gettext to say OK this is the point where this is version one and then if a paper we say we cite Merlin version one then this is the version we refer to.",

            "Some examples of these, I think there probably more, we just really started doing this and our data is very specific, so for other people there might be other problems.",
            "So first thing that we notice so not all data is publicly available, some of them because we collect data from from school from school children and then there are these privacy issues as intellectual property issues.",
            "So we can only make them available until the very specific circumstances where in our case is actually in academic context, so it's not so bad, but still you have to do something, can't upload it on git and make it publicly available.",

            "You can hide the git repository.",
            "You can password protect it.",

            "So how can I trust it with my data?",
            "Easy solution, use GitLab, you can install it yourself on your own server.",
            "You have full control.",
            "And then I think we notice with Docker, so if you if you build your Docker containers with Docker files.",
            "Then if you re run the Docker file like 2, three months later there, there might be different things happening because there's no explicit versioning normally, and it's these are not not enforced.",

            "Just rely on the actual build images on the containers themselves, and then they don't need to be rebuilt, hopefully, and then they will be in the right version anyway.",

            "And especially with with living data, like linguistic corpora it, I think it's really important that you keep versioning and that you keep different versions available.",
            "As long as you actually cite them in in papers and use them for analysis.",
            "And we think that stand that I teach you is like it, and Docker seem to offer and more as easy way to to actually handle this problem.",

            "One is obvious so that Karen can.",
            "The community can develop prospectuses and guidelines, and then they can be shared within the communities and say if you start collecting data, make sure you start putting it in some kind of versioning system right away so you don't have to like retroactively do it later.",

            "What to do with data that can't be shared or these kind of things?",

            "He wrote this nice sentence in, you know abstract as this is a general problem like large large files or large data structures and versioning of them is a problem that also software community development community has and we have great hopes that this will be solved soon, but for the moment I think there's no good solution really.",
            "I mean either you you version it and then live with it that it takes forever to.",
            "To upload and that it takes huge space also with other the version history on your computer.",
            "Or you can or you don't and feel bad about it.",
            "I think there's really no no good solution that I can can think of.",
            "And for web services, I think the the responsibility lies with the people that provide the web services.",
            "So you should talk to them and say I want to make sure that what I'm doing everything web services reproducible.",

            "In five years?",

            "Yourself, yeah?",
            "Cannot.",
            "Yeah, but yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean I think these these things are very complicated so there are huge structures that are just one tool.",
            "There's sometimes a whole array of tools, and if you're going to dockerize every single version might be complicated.",
            "You notice that in our use case there was only data so far because we notice that the tool.",
            "Part is actually the really complicated button.",
            "That's why we still haven't gotten around to two starting this.",
            "Also because in our tool chain that actually manual steps sometimes, which are even worse.",
            "But but with respect to data, if you if you're going to concentrate on data then I didn't quite see the advantage of having both the the gates and and for example the space.",

            "Which kid doesn't have.",
            "Not necessarily.",
            "I mean, you can put the metadata in there, but yeah, but I think the guitar at other other advantages.",
            "For example, you can easily diff between different versions.",
            "You can say what actually changed.",
            "I mean we have a change log, but you can still say show me exactly what changed between version one and version 2 and then get you have this nice diffun which indeed space you can't.",
            "You have to download both and do the diff locali and that's with annoying.",
            "OK, can we move to the next question here?",
            "Enclara plus in the Netherlands.",
            "We are actually.",
            "This is one of the plans for the coming years to set up one basically in a Docker hub, but then for clarity itself to for the rehearsal for the reproducibility and the storage of the Docker containers.",
            "Regarding the issue of dynamic data, these living large scale mostly in our case mostly knowledge graphs.",
            "One of the things that we're considering is instead of versioning consistently, everything is pushing this to the researcher and basically telling him him or her saying OK, you know if you're going to do your research on this subsection of that graph.",
            "Take that.",
            "Make debt persistent at that very point, maybe even included in your Docker container, and then you basically have the data and the software that was that.",
            "Then that experiment was running with combined inside the container, and that's actually good.",
            "Good idea to basically put everything together in one container and then you just need to say Docker run and the whole experiment runs for your persistent identifier to your to that container and it also we think.",
            "I mean this is purely theoretically we're planning this.",
            "We have not, we have not.",
            "In that sense, you're really, you're ahead, but one of the things we also consider this the issue of because that's something that we haven't touched on, is it?",
            "It's data it software, but also hardware.",
            "Oh yes, I mean in a couple of years times, the machines that currently do your do your experiment, you will still have the software.",
            "Maybe you will still have the data, but you won't have the machine anymore to running on.",
            "Yeah, and maybe their communities and an environment like that could also.",
            "Further, I mean, yeah, I mean.",
            "This is the same issue in in that I'm not sure if it's the tub software, archaeology or I mean there are people that archive archive old games for example and there like really working hard also to virtualize the hardware.",
            "So I mean there are people also looking at things.",
            "There are now like things, emulators, emulators basically or I mean some.",

            "You can either keep the hardware somewhere in the basement and prayed to God that it doesn't break or or you can look.",
            "This is largely system independent.",

            "So I I see some some possibilities of, you know, migrating a Docker image to in a docker in and of itself not.",
            "I mean you Docker on your own machine, then yeah it.",
            "It depends on what on the on the computation resources in that machine uses the hardware that you have.",

            "That's why we in in Clarion L are really looking at Kubernetes and that basically you're detaching your computational resources from the, so that might be a solution.",
            "OK, I see a follow up there.",
            "I mean yeah, so last question in the back, but definitely this is I think to be continued in incorporation.",
            "Yeah, so we should thank you for your presentation.",
            "Bit prolong maybe the last notes and.",
            "It looks like you are playing around a bit to black box when your concerns software things becausw to my opinion as a reproduction aghbal research can be used for if you're clearly defined functions.",

            "So what what about this black box problem?",
