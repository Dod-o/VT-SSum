            "But other than that, it's really very similar to exploratory pattern exploratory data analysis.",

            "Some people would call it a data mining result.",
            "So pattern is something defined very generally not in the limited definition used by people in the frequent pattern mining community or pattern means something else.",
            "OK, so examples of pattern syntax is that we all know, or for example, a cluster.",
            "The fact that there is a cluster present in the data, or maybe a whole clustering, maybe partition of the data.",

            "In fact there are many ways in which people have specified pattern syntax is that somehow represents a cluster or a clustering of the data.",
            "The second example that does come from the pattern mining community is a tile or a tile in a database, which really is is very similar to the fact that an item sets in binary data matrix is frequent.",

            "Indexes in such complex data.",
            "OK, so we think that somehow we make to make progress in exported data mining and making it less of an arts and more of a signs.",
            "We think that we need a very powerful language to describe patterns, indexes of those types and you see the diversity is very large, so that means it needs to be powerful.",

            "In itemset, mining is started off with frequency, but since done lots of people have identified and defined often more useful alternatives, there are also objective interesting this measures for item sets.",
            "For Association rules, the subgroup discovery, we have a large number of them, maybe one of the most well known was is awaited relative accuracy.",

            "On the other hand, wrist, there is a research effort to define what I would call subjective interestingness measures and other people call it this way too, which are interesting.",
            "This measures that somehow try to take the prior information of the user into account as well, so they don't say, OK, I can define interesting this in an objective way in a universal way that will hold true for everyone, but I did find it which Spectre specific user with.",

            "An an effect I will talk about it in his keynote talk an another line of research is based on information theoretic approaches, which is something we have been working on quite a bit.",
            "But there are strong connections between those.",
            "Those two approaches in fact.",
            "Now I should state just as a disclaimer, I'm not going to show any references in this introduction just for the sake of brevity, but we intend to make a long list of relevant relevant references available online on the virtual website.",

            "OK, so maybe this is this is the least important.",
