            "Or sometimes they have neutral as well?",

            "And then there's this is sort of fun.",
            "Why this is is in the model, because essentially, the opinions about objects.",
            "OK, basically top of the root node of the tree, so the sentiment classification essentially try to find the opinion about the object itself.",
            "Because we say also the object is a feature.",

            "OK?",

            "So future level.",
            "Obviously this is fitting the model.",
            "So task basically says identify and extract features like extract features and this is a difficult problem, information instruction.",
            "So the second thing is if you got the features now, what is the opinion?",
            "OK?",
            "What is the opinion on that particular feature?",
