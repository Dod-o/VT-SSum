            "And frankly, we learned that scientific communities such as this one really make all this hassle worth it.",
            "That we get a lot of excitement not only about using Protege in our own work to investigate new opportunities and knowledge engineering, and to study new ways of knowledge engineering, but the way in which we interact with our community, the way our Inter community gives us new ideas that we can incorporate in our work has just been enormously gratifying.",
