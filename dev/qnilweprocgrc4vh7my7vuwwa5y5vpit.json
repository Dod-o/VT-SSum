            "Actually I think is machine learning statistics maybe where the the heavy point of NIPS lies.",
            "What we can learn, maybe from psychology, is that if our objective is to model how people pick from a set of N items.",
            "We should be prepared actually to predict how people choose items from any subset of these ends or how you frame which items are available.",
            "When Daniel McFadden introduced this GV model and introduced discrete choice, he gave that a firm footing in equal metrics.",
            "And of course, the motivation from random utility models that independent global integration gives you logistic regression model.",
            "Statisticians might then argue and say, well, this JV mold is very general.",
            "But the models that are used in practice are quite often generalized linear models.",
            "Now you could argue if you should make a distinction between machine learning and statistics, but I think there's of those researchers they call themselves machine learning.",
            "Researchers have have added an emphasis.",
            "Also nonlinear models, and we see actually several interesting posters and papers today on mostly Gaussian process extensions of these choice or preference models.",

            "You could print the whole data set on one page.",
            "I think what is exciting now is that we see that we have a lot of large scale data coming from the web and so that that gives opportunities.",
            "But of course also challenges of computation.",
            "So just now also becoming strongly a computational problem.",
            "They get other reason.",
            "Why this is important to Nips is that many of the important applications of choice models preference learning are have been on center stage at several lips conferences.",
            "So we have core search advertisements E Commerce, and I've even heard rumors that people use these models to predict what movies people should go and watch.",
            "And then so all these lists actually I make.",

            "The field is old, it several decades old, and if you take a very liberal interpretation then maybe it's getting close to a century.",
            "So one might argue it isn't is a solved problem.",
            "Then we know that we know this stuff by now.",
            "And I think there's several reasons of why there still is an unsolved problem, and why it's important that with some regularity we have workshops on this topic.",
            "So the two that I think deserve highlight here is that the models that we end up using using are often too simplistic.",
            "They're not the ideal models that we would like to use.",
            "And so that is partly because maybe we don't have the right modeling framework to describe the models that we would like to use.",
            "But quite often there's also a a computational limitation, so we know what the ideal model looks like, but we can't work with it because the numerical integration if we encounter, we can't do so.",
            "We have several interesting papers later today that explain how to how to approximate.",
            "Advanced Model step one wouldn't be able to deal with exactly.",

            "There are now so many new sources of data available, lot of them online and digital in large scale.",
            "That it is not too far fetched that we can help in in in answering some of these questions on which models might be more reliable, more more accurate in predicting than others.",

            "Give access to a large body of cheap labor and you can read this as subjects in experiments.",

            "So it's not too far fetched.",
            "That now a larger group of researchers will be able to run serious experiments so that we will see in the coming years at NIPS serious experiments on what models should look like.",
