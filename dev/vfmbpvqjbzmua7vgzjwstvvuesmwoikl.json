            "Toxicity studies in animal toxicity studies, usually relatively high doses are used.",

            "One is because.",

            "But in nanoparticle problematics we are dealing mostly with subchronic and chronic toxicity, and just to somehow.",

            "Those responses we can establish the parameters that we that we can then extrapolate to human situation and based on these parameters, then in the risk assessment and risk characterization, we then, with the composition of these values and of course exposure assessment, we can establish the limit values.",
