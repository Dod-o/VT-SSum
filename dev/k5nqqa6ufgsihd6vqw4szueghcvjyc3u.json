            "I prefer not to give a percentage offset because my antenna is flat and why it's so if I say percentage offset.",

            "If you have 2.4 giga Hertz, the wavelength is about 10 centimeters.",
            "A little bit more, but let's take 10.",
            "And of those 10 centimeters, we need to take a quarter.",
            "So let's say it's 3 centimeters, so it's 30 millimeters.",
            "Because the units here are millimeters, and I put a 30 here.",
            "That's just a rule of thumb.",
            "It doesn't need to be exactly, so you don't need to pull out the Calculator and calculate it up to three at 10 digits behind the decimal.",
            "That's a rough rule here.",
            "So now you see the region now there full screen is full of region.",
            "In order to get a little bit of handle on that you can press control and D and it will adjust the size of your object too.",
            "The screen.",

            "What's the weather for offset 30 millimeters?",
            "Is everybody, did everybody get to that point?",
            "Please show your hand because when I started that I know those seminars you missed one click and then you're completely lost.",

            "It was tough.",
            "You're done OK, good then what?",
            "What we did that reaching for is because we want to solve inside the region and if we leave the region like that it acts at the boundary of the region, acts like a metal wall.",
            "So we have a nice antenna.",
            "The antenna is sending out some waves there reflected on that fantastic metal wall.",
            "They go back and I get everything back and the return loss is everything that I'll send out will.",
            "Return except for some.",
            "Little bit of losses due to finite conductivity or so.",
            "So we want radiation boundary conditions, so we select the box by clicking on it.",
            "It should be Violet.",
            "Then you right click.",
            "And then there's this select all object faces.",
            "I want to select all the object faces I want to select all the six phases of my box because I want to put boundary conditions on those.",
            "That's the easiest way to do it so.",
            "Select all the faces now and then right click again.",
            "Now we need to tell HS what boundary conditions we want, and there's this thing assigned boundary.",
            "And here we see all the possible boundary conditions.",
            "We don't want to have perfect E or age.",
            "We don't want finite conductivity on the boundary.",
            "We want radiation, it's here.",

            "We don't want to use that, so leave it unchecked.",

            "What you should should see now is that in this project tree here.",
            "You get on the boundaries.",
            "This + and you can open it and there should be radiation.",
            "And if you click on it you should see your cube with all the faces.",
            "Kind of in this funny pattern.",
            "OK. Good, I'm assuming everybody got here, please stop me.",
            "If I'm too fast.",
            "So now we're done with the air box.",
            "There's not very much else to say about the air box, so we select it.",
            "And then there's somewhere this fantastic buttons, which.",

            "And there's this I with the Red Cross.",

            "And we want to use copper.",
            "I think that's the conductivity of copper, but if you want to make sure that you're modeling copper copper, you can check here the box use material.",
            "And now it's choosing vacuum.",
            "That's no good, so we push on the button.",

            "'cause it already chose copper.",
            "Now it's copper and we say OK. Can you show?",
            "Yeah, yeah it should look like that and select it should be feet, G&D and use.",
            "So it should be.",
            "This ground plane with a hole.",
            "Wait, let me.",
            "So if you select it, it's this sheet.",
            "Then the use.",
            "And then you need to turn it around.",
            "And select this feed here.",
            "Those three.",
            "OK. And then you select the finite conductivity and you can check.",
            "Here when you.",
            "Click again on that.",
            "It makes a funny pattern on all the.",
            "Cheats where they have finite conductivity.",
            "But it also should tell you that it's copper here.",
            "You should see in that button cooperate.",
            "It shouldn't be vacuum by default it would be vacuum, which is no good, hey.",
            "So I think now material wise and boundary condition wise we are OK. We have radiating boundary condition.",
            "We know that the traces are made of copper and we know that.",
            "The substrate is made of Fr 4 so hi, viz knows all of that.",
            "Now we need to tell you something about the excitation.",
            "So we need to feed the.",
            "Antenna with some signals.",
            "For that we select the last surface here, which is this little thing which I called port.",
            "Here it should be the last one in the unassigned sheets in this tree.",
            "For me it's called port here and then again the right mouse button and assign excitation.",
            "And we do not want it away support.",
            "We want it to be a lump port.",
            "That's important.",
            "I won't go really into the difference between lumped and wave port for the wave port should be at the boundary of my region.",
            "Lamport is inside.",
            "It's kind of inside the geometry.",
            "It's not coming from outside.",
            "It's more like giving a voltage source right there inside, so we make a lump port.",
            "And then you should get that window asking you what should be the reference and what should be the terminal.",
            "We want the reference to be the ground and the terminal is the feet.",
            "OK.",
            "Does everybody get that box?",
            "Yes, OK. And we click OK.",
            "So now we should see that excitation here in the tree.",
            "If we click on it, we see that it's red here.",
            "And.",
            "There should be 1 terminal under it.",
            "And if you click on the terminal, you see that that line here should be right now.",
            "Can you see it there?",
            "There's a little red line here.",
            "Goods.",
            "Now we got the boundaries and excitations.",
            "We go further down in the tree.",
            "Next would be mesh operation.",
            "But we remember the nice transparency that I showed you.",
            "There's also adaptive meshing will try.",
            "We will shoot for that.",
            "It will work very well here.",
            "Measure operations typically use only if you want to reduce the amount of mesh.",
            "For example, if you have round surfaces and you know I don't want that round surface to be so nice.",
            "And I want to save elements or something like that.",
            "Here we don't need to help HFSS very much with the mesh.",
            "It's beautiful objects or rectangular and cubes and so on.",
            "That's very good.",
            "What we need to do an analysis set up so we right click on the analysis and we add a solution set up.",
            "That should look like that.",
            "Um?",
            "And we need to specify a solution frequency.",
            "Now we have a problem.",
            "We have a dual band antenna, so we don't know the solution frequency.",
            "There should be 2 solution frequencies.",
            "We have only one.",
            "Here I choose the higher one 5.8 giga Hertz.",
            "And it asks for maximum number of passes.",
            "Six is too little.",
            "I normally give 20.",
            "That doesn't mean it's using 20 passes, it will stop after between 7 and 12 passes or so.",
            "But it needs those and we click OK. And we have this setup.",
            "And.",
            "The next what we do is we add a second set up.",
            "Because we are also interested in the 2.4 giga Hertz.",
            "So we make a second set up for 2.4 giga Hertz.",
            "We allow for 20 passes and now we do some extra trick.",
            "Becauses what we want to do is we want to check whether 5.8 GHz mesh is also good for 2.4 giga Hertz.",
            "So we want to show if we start this 2.4 giga Hertz setup with the final measure of the 5.8 giga Hertz.",
            "Whether it's already happy with that.",
            "So let's kind of.",
            "More complex idea, but I think it's good for the optimization later becausw.",
            "Hopefully we will find out that the mesh at 5.8 giga Hertz is already good and we can just use that mesh and get a single solution that's much faster.",
            "So.",
            "In order to do that, we go to the Advanced tab and say import mesh.",
            "Then this box will open.",
            "It's a setup box.",
            "We use this project and it already knows here that it should be the setup one.",
            "We lost adaptive.",
            "And we click OK. We get this dialogue.",
            "We accept the setup and we're done.",
            "And what you should see is now you have two setups, a set up one and the set up two and set up two.",
            "You have this funny arrow.",
            "Which indicates that you import the mesh from somewhere else.",
            "So now it will first solve setup one, adopt the mesh for 5.8 giga Hertz and then take that mesh and adoptive adopted for 2.4 giga Hertz and then we might care also about.",
            "Seeing a frequency sweep, seeing how the S parameters are in the region around there.",
            "So maybe we want to start at 1.5 giga Hertz so you right click on setup two and select add frequency sweep.",
            "And you get this box and you want the interpolating sweep from 1.5 to 7 giga Hertz, maybe in steps of 0.01 giga Hertz.",
            "This gives a fairly smooth curve.",
            "That's all we want.",
            "We don't want any special extra settings we want to use.",
            "The standard otherwise OK.",
            "So now we expect that everything is ready for us all.",
            "So we can have fun now.",
            "Um?",
            "Maybe first we checked with a really we didn't miss any obvious thing in the setup, so we click this check mark here.",
            "A green check mark on the top.",
            "That means just check with the.",
            "If I would press soil weather everything, all the information that HFS needs is there and you should get.",
            "Green checkmarks everywhere.",
            "Sorry.",
            "Yep.",
            "You need to click on this check Mark button up there in the toolbar.",
            "Do you have that?",
            "Thanks.",
            "So now if everybody has done that, we can just press the exclamation mark.",
            "And it will start solving.",
            "Oh no.",
            "Sorry, can you abort it?",
            "We want to maybe use.",
            "Faster.",
            "So we click.",
            "Tools on the menu go on, tools, options, HSS options.",
            "So let me start it again, tools.",
            "Options HSS options.",
            "And on the solver.",
            "You can tell it to use four cores.",
            "That will increase the speed a little bit.",
            "And then we can solve and then we press again the exclamation mark.",
            "Now it takes a little while.",
            "You see, it should first solve the setup one.",
            "It did the measure already and now it's solving past two already.",
            "Three.",
            "It should go fairly fast now.",
            "You see, it needs at least 7 passes.",
            "And you see, each pass gets a little bit slower because of the exponential curve.",
            "You get 30% more elements in each pass.",
            "So even if you start with thousand elements, eventually you get more.",
            "If you want to see what's going on, you can right click on the set up and.",
            "Click here on convergence.",
            "There you see the pass is the number of elements.",
            "And the error in the S parameter.",
            "So after after 10 passes, mine converged here.",
            "Now it should start with the setup too.",
            "And start adaptive pass one there.",
            "So now we can check the setup 2 here.",
            "The result here.",
            "I'm.",
            "You should see this, So what you see here is that of course in the initial pass it doesn't know what the percentage error is because it didn't have any S parameter before, but you see, in the second pass, the error is much lower.",
            "I mean, we had as a criterium specified 0.02.",
            "So it's by a factor of 3 lower.",
            "So we can assume that it was already converged.",
            "On the initial pass.",
            "So that means we can trust the mesh already from the 5.8 GHz setup.",
            "For the optimization, we will make use of that becausw.",
            "This way we save this extra adaptive pass.",
            "And here you see, now it's already doing the frequency sweep.",
            "The interpolating sweep.",
            "I don't know.",
            "Do you see similar things on your screen?",
            "And in order to see something about the interpolating sweep.",
            "You can go to their profile.",
            "And under the profile you see at which frequencies it's sweeping, two interpolating sweep means it doesn't really calculate every frequency point.",
            "It calculates several frequency points.",
            "Interpolates those points and checks whether if it adds a new point where the accuracy is already good enough so that it always adds a new point.",
            "Calculates that compares to the interpolated result and checks how far the error is and if the error is below.",
            "Whatever is specified, then it stops here the error was still at 36%.",
            "And hopefully soon it's going to be much lower.",
            "I'm closing this window here.",
            "And while it's calculating, we can already start a little bit of post processing becausw the solution at 2.4 and 5.8 giga Hertz are already there, so we can have a look at what's going on there.",
            "Um?",
            "So one thing one can do is we select.",
            "All the objects, so you go into that window and press control A.",
            "And then all objects should be selected.",
            "Now, for example, we want to see the currents on those metal sheets.",
            "So we right click.",
            "We go to plot fields.",
            "And we want the magnitude of J surf.",
            "The currents are only on the surface, so we are only interested in the surface currents we want to see.",
            "The magnitude of those.",
            "Mine was also still calculating solutions, but if set up at the first passes.",
            "Yeah, yeah, I'm doing post processing for set up one and also for set up two in a moment but not for the sweep yet.",
            "So I want to see the currents on the surface at 5.8 giga Hertz, so I just click OK here to the dialogue.",
            "And you see the current distribution at 5.8 giga Hertz.",
            "And maybe you want to compare what's what's the difference between the functioning of the antenna at 5.8 giga Hertz and 2.4 giga Hertz?",
            "What makes a difference?",
            "Why is it doesn't work at those two bands?",
            "So we want to compare those so we make a second plot of the same thing.",
            "But when the dialogue here shows up, you want to select, not the set up one, but they set up to.",
            "And you can plot that.",
            "No, it looks kind of ugly because there are two currents, but you can switch between those two.",
            "If I take the plot visibility of that away.",
            "Maybe I make the window here a little bit bigger that it looks more beautiful.",
            "You see at.",
            "If you compare, I take it plot visibility of both away and you see if you click on that just once, you see the current distribution that was for 5.8 giga Hertz.",
            "And you can compare it to 2.4 giga Hertz so you see that it's quite a different mode.",
            "One recurrence were mainly here and here.",
            "And for the 2.4 GHz dependent on AG located here.",
            "So it is a different resonance of your antenna which is actually at work there.",
            "OK. Did everybody get that?",
            "Get those pictures?",
            "The next thing we want to maybe check is a return loss.",
            "So we right click on results.",
            "Go to create terminal solution data report.",
            "We want a rectangular plot.",
            "What a rectangular plot.",
            "So results, right click create terminal solution data report and the rectangular plot.",
            "OK. And there it already knows what we want.",
            "This.",
            "We want the S parameter.",
            "We want the return loss and there is only one as parameter and that's a return loss.",
            "So we click new report and we get something like that.",
            "So we see that around 2.4 giga Hertz.",
            "We have a minimum of the return loss, but it's not 2.4 giga.",
            "Hertz is slightly next to it, so I add a marker here.",
            "It's actually at 2.3 giga Hertz.",
            "That's not really what we wanted because at 2.4 giga Hertz the return loss is not really great.",
            "It's minus 5.7 data.",
            "That's very bad, so that's not a good antenna for that band.",
            "For the 2.3 Giga Hertz Band, it would be fantastic.",
            "But somehow, that's not what we wanted and hear the return loss.",
            "At 5.8 Giga Hertz, could also let's already acceptable, but maybe could be better, so that's one reason why we want to optimize.",
            "OK. No, we're done with a single run, and now we want to start optimizing becausw.",
            "The idea was that over the lunch break.",
            "The cluster doesn't have a lunch break.",
            "OK.",
            "So what we need to do is we have here in those setups.",
            "We have to set up one and set up two in the sweep you saw.",
            "It took some quite awhile to do all of those tasks.",
            "Maybe we can do that a little bit faster be cause if we optimize we need to calculate a lot of designs.",
            "We want to have 60 designs at the end.",
            "So what we do is we delete this sweep so we click on the sweep, we remove that.",
            "We set up two.",
            "We also don't need.",
            "We remove that.",
            "And we've set up one.",
            "Can you please open set up?",
            "Yep.",
            "Shape.",
            "I don't have a sweep on set up one, but.",
            "Just delete everything except for set up one.",
            "All the other setups and sweeps and so on.",
            "We don't need.",
            "We want only the setup one.",
            "OK. And to the set up one of course we are also interested in 2.4 giga Hertz, but we have a smarter way to add that we add a frequency sweep.",
            "Which is not going to be really a sweep.",
            "We don't do an interpolating sweep.",
            "We make a discrete sweep, so there should be discreet here.",
            "We don't want linear step, we want a single point, so it's not a sweep, it's cheating.",
            "And the single point should be at 2.4 giga Hertz and don't press OK Now.",
            "First press insert.",
            "We want that here.",
            "There is really this thing we don't want to save the fields that should be unchecked because saving fields costs resources.",
            "We don't need those fields.",
            "We just want the 2.4 giga Hertz.",
            "And we click OK. And.",
            "That's pretty much it here.",
            "Now what we need to do in order to optimize is we need to hand down the parameters.",
            "So in order to do that, we open this optometrics thing here and click on the on this make a double click.",
            "We need to specify all the parameters that are involved.",
            "And I want to include everything here.",
            "Everything should be checked except for.",
            "My substrate is given.",
            "So everybody should have this.",
            "The dimensions of the substrate are somehow given.",
            "I need to put that antenna on such a PCP.",
            "And.",
            "Did everybody get to that point?",
            "The next thing is we also need to give the relevant results back to the workbench.",
            "That we do by going to the calculations tab.",
            "And in the calculations we want to set up calculations.",
            "We want exactly 2 calculations.",
            "We want the return loss at 2.4 GHz and the return loss at 5.8 GHz because we want to optimize those two quantities.",
            "So what we do is here.",
            "The setup one sweep that basically gives you return loss at 2.4 giga Hertz Becausw.",
            "The suite contains exactly one point that was a 2.4 giga Hertz, so we add that calculation.",
            "And then we also need the return loss at two point at 5.8 giga Hertz.",
            "That was exactly the last adaptive pass of the five points of the set of one.",
            "We also add that calculation.",
            "What you should get on the box behind it is this one.",
            "Here it should look like that.",
            "And you see that the one is at 2.4 giga Hertz, the other at 5.8 giga Hertz.",
            "Did everybody get that?",
            "When I click here done.",
            "And then the names are twice the same.",
            "That's a little bit stupid, so I give it a better name, so that should be S2 four, because that's a 2.4 giga Hertz and that's the S parameter at 5.8 giga Hertz.",
            "Is everybody, did everybody get to that point?",
            "How I added that?",
            "You you right click on set up.",
            "You add frequency sweep.",
            "Where?",
            "Ah.",
            "Calculations, setup calculations.",
            "We can switch between setup one sweep and set up one last adoptive last.",
            "Adoptive is at 5.8 giga Hertz, the sweep is at 2.4 GHz.",
            "Because this week contains only one point.",
            "OK, we're almost done.",
            "On the on the HF side, once you're done with that, we're done.",
            "Now we just need to set up the optimization in the workbench.",
            "That will take us another five minutes, and I know the time I think I'm supposed to finish in minus 10 minutes.",
            "Messages.",
            "OK.",
            "So we're done with the age of this setup, so we can just close H for this.",
            "So just close it.",
            "Don't close the workbench now what we gonna do?",
            "We haven't done it for awhile.",
            "Maybe for too long, but we should press save.",
            "I also tend not to do it, but I know that's a very bad habit.",
            "Sometimes we regret if we didn't do it.",
            "OK is everybody there.",
            "So the important thing is now you see this parameter set here below.",
            "That is because we handed down parameters.",
            "So we let's basically the geometry parameters which are now given from the Workbench 2.",
            "HFS and HFS gives us back some results.",
            "The return losses at those two frequencies OK. And now we want to do something with that.",
            "And we want to optimize, so I'm making some space below because we want to hang an optimizer just below here and that one.",
            "We need to find that's not in the analysis system.",
            "It's not in the component systems, so it's not here.",
            "But it's down here.",
            "There's an obvious line folder.",
            "And there's an optimization.",
            "And we grab one of those optimization blocks and just throw it in that green area below the parameter set.",
            "That appears OK. Then it takes a little moment.",
            "And hopefully the window will pop up.",
            "Just a minute.",
            "Yes.",
            "Now we need the instructions.",
            "Becausw here there are some Rangers given.",
            "What optics land normally does?",
            "Is there is a parameter value currently and it takes a range of plus and minus 10%.",
            "Maybe that's not always the smartest choice.",
            "I have some better choices, but for that I need.",
            "Some presentation.",
            "It's basically written in the.",
            "In this document here.",
            "But much further down, we already did most of the workshop.",
            "It's here.",
            "On page, what is it 23?",
            "And we see that.",
            "Here here you see those parameter values and you should enter those.",
            "So that goes from 25 to 30.",
            "The first entry that's WS in millimeter.",
            "So that should be from 25 to 30 millimeters.",
            "I think the second one stays like that.",
            "The next three parameters I remember they were starting all at one.",
            "And the first one I need to check was from one to two.",
            "The others are from 123.",
            "OK, so 122.",
            "And 123.",
            "So we got half of the parameters already.",
            "I'm going to continue entering and you can copy so the next one is from 1.5 to 2.5.",
            "Then from.",
            "0.722 and the next one is the width of the feet there.",
            "What I did is I checked the Calculator on the Internet.",
            "They're free calculators.",
            "If you want a 50 ohm microstrip line, it should be this in that white.",
            "That's what I used.",
            "Um, but I still allow it to optimize it.",
            "I think we Calculator told me something like 3.2 should be the width of the thing.",
            "I start from 3 and go to 3.4.",
            "Just to be on the safe side.",
            "And the last one was 13 to 16.",
            "That is kind of adjusted.",
            "Let's a length of the strip line that kind of has a chance to be kind of in the middle of that slot.",
            "The end of the so you should have those parameter values.",
            "I leave it for a moment 'cause I did it fast.",
            "But I wanted to get the full picture and this way you.",
            "10 copies now.",
            "We don't have to switch back and forth between the documents.",
            "OK then we click next.",
            "Uniform.",
            "Distribution.",
            "Oh I OK. Will.",
            "I don't know how to.",
            "Things like.",
            "OK. Is it that?",
            "Is it that one or?",
            "If you look at the PDF there yeah.",
            "Yeah, it's that one.",
            "So we need to change all of those too.",
            "Uniform.",
            "I think also if you click on all and then change it all in one step.",
            "Doesn't work.",
            "Nope.",
            "OK, now it works OK. Everything should be uniform.",
            "Good, now we got that.",
            "OK, so next.",
            "Now we need to specify the goal.",
            "So what we want to do is minimize both return losses.",
            "So what I'm going to calculate is the maximum of the two return losses and I want to be that as small as possible.",
            "OK, so here under expression I type now Max.",
            "And then I open normal parenthesis.",
            "And then I need to give a set.",
            "The set is specified by those other parenthesis brackets, the square brackets.",
            "And then I want S2, four in there, and S. 58 So you should have that expression is automatically knows it should be minimal.",
            "I could also choose maximum, but here I'm really.",
            "I really want a minimum.",
            "So it's kind of funny to have a minimum of the maximum, but that's the right way to get it small.",
            "Both of them OK.",
            "If you enter that, that's all we need to enter on that one.",
            "We don't want any constraints or second goal or anything, that's all, so we go on next.",
            "That we just accept as it is.",
            "And now it's about choosing the algorithm to optimize.",
            "Now the experience shows that this preselected algorithm is not what we want to use.",
            "We want to use some evolutionary algorithm.",
            "So it basically generates it like 10 random design points.",
            "And then it kind of does mutations and so on of those of the best design points and tries to get better design points out of that.",
            "I don't know exactly what's behind the algorithm, but that's kind of in words.",
            "That sound good description of what it does.",
            "So we choose that that's all we need to choose.",
            "Here.",
            "Has everybody chosen the evolutionary algorithm, the global one?",
            "OK. And once you've chosen the algorithm.",
            "We go to the next.",
            "There it says.",
            "It has a start population size of 10 and now we don't have the time to calculate 40 up to 40 generations of 10 designs.",
            "But we have the time to do it, maybe up to six generations.",
            "My experiences with that you already get a quite good result.",
            "You could imagine letting it run for another couple of hours and get a better result, but we stick with that so he the thing you need to do on here is just enter a 6 instead of a 40.",
            "OK, please enter a six year.",
            "I want to go home tonight.",
            "Function available OK. And then we already through that dialogue.",
            "And we should get an ice box below here.",
            "OK. We're almost done now you're better at the safe, of course, and we need to do the RSM setup.",
            "Huh?",
            "Yep.",
            "So we need to open the RSM.",
            "Yep.",
            "OK, so we are officially still here and we are saving.",
            "OK, then we opened the RSM so it's this thing.",
            "It's here and that window should pop up.",
            "On the desktop.",
            "Yeah, there's a I can hear that one.",
            "OK. Where is my art in here?",
            "That one.",
            "For those users you can see the set password.",
            "They have to set the password.",
            "For those who have done this, use the right mouse button.",
            "On that we can see like that and then set password.",
            "Just use me to that username and password as we currently working on your machine.",
            "OK, once it passwords are set.",
            "We go back to the workbench.",
            "OK, in the workbench we need to do too.",
            "Also attended how many drops is supposed to distribute and how many cores it's supposed to use and so on.",
            "So first click on this one parameter set, then on the right hand side.",
            "Here there should be some properties.",
            "On the update option here should be changed.",
            "We want to use the remote solver manager.",
            "We don't want to calculate everything locally here.",
            "We want to send a bunch of jobs to the cluster.",
            "And here we want to have one job for each design point.",
            "And we need to specify here a solver manager, the Prilog HPC.",
            "And the queue should not be local but normal.",
            "So you need to change the 1st the 2nd.",
            "And the two last ones.",
            "To the settings as I have it here, it should look exactly like that.",
            "Has everybody that then one last thing we also need to click on here, then we get on another.",
            "We know like that and we should check here use RSM modes.",
            "We really want to use a cluster for the optimization.",
            "And we don't want to calculate only one point in parallel, because that we could do faster on the local machine most likely.",
            "For us, each generation has 10 points, so all those 10 points should be calculated simultaneously.",
            "This will be enter here 10.",
            "And then we have everything and we should not forget to save.",
            "OK. Is everybody has everybody saved?",
            "Then when we're ready to go for lunch, we we just need to right click on the EA here.",
            "And.",
            "We want to select update.",
            "Maybe once we started that we should stay for one moment and see whether everything is going alright.",
            "And there should be.",
            "No jobs popping up.",
            "Question.",
            "So if you push that button, you only see your jobs and eventually after a couple of minutes there should be exactly 10 jobs listed here.",
            "And after a little while there should be kind of this battery like sign.",
            "That means that it's doing something.",
            "Actually.",
            "And if you click on such a battery like sign, you should also check whether at some point calculation really starts.",
            "If that's verified, we can go to lunch.",
            "Did everybody manage to get that far?",
            "Chapter.",
            "So you see, I've got here 10 design points, one through 10.",
            "And the first one already started working.",
            "On the arms starting to see one more line.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I'm in the active job, the one with the battery.",
            "You should see I mean, if you see that that's a good sign, see that line that is actually requested.",
            "The design point.",
            "OK, I I mean the only thing I did is I resubmitted the job that we sent before lunch break and we've got some results there now.",
            "So you see, it calculated now with some 40 something design points or there's still some.",
            "They were waiting for.",
            "Anne.",
            "Now you you see that we got already some better results, so the best result is currently this number 29, I think.",
            "So you see here.",
            "The design number 2 on one axis and that's kind of the maximum return loss of the at the two frequencies.",
            "So we got now down to minus 14.3.",
            "The bill, which is already considered quite good for antenna.",
            "After some.",
            "30 runs and you see in general there's a trend that.",
            "The results get better.",
            "It's a. Algorithm which works with random numbers and so on, so you get it.",
            "It's not going straight to the very best design, but you see so quite fast way to get to a quite good design.",
            "Here we could have a closer look to the design #29.",
            "So that would be here in the workbench and we can go to 29.",
            "We which is.",
            "There's a slight discrepancy between that number and actually the design point.",
            "So it's here.",
            "You see, you get those numbers.",
            "And.",
            "Currently I still want to let it run till it got 60 design points.",
            "I mean one could now go ahead and validate the result and throw the.",
            "It's parameter curve, but I think I still have to wait.",
            "Two optimization is done.",
            "Stopping that.",
            "OK. Actually, the last design point is the best one.",
            "Sometimes it happens.",
            "I couldn't predict that, but there we get a return of minus 18 disabil, so that is really very good.",
            "I don't know whether I should.",
            "Today I mean.",
            "No one can.",
            "Go ahead and just check whether that design point is really all that good and where the minima are lying.",
            "Before we saw that the minimum return loss were not exactly at the specified frequencies.",
            "So let's now take that design point.",
            "And I can copy the inputs to the current input.",
            "Anne.",
            "Go back to the project and tell it here to actually go to the design that we had before so that we can.",
            "Parameter values are now adjusted.",
            "And hopefully in a moment.",
            "I can open.",
            "HFSS?",
            "Now we remember that we had this weird sweep which was a discrete sweep.",
            "Now I want to actually.",
            "Remove that one and two, a real sweep.",
            "From we had it from 1.5 two.",
            "Seven Giga Hertz in those steps.",
            "OK. And now we can analyze that.",
            "And hopefully within a few minutes we will get a nice lot of the return loss.",
            "So you see the passes.",
            "No, no, no.",
            "We need to observe the convergence, otherwise merge.",
            "Properly.",
            "But as I said, I was involved in antenna design.",
            "Few tiles go and I know that this is quite difficult to optimize properly.",
            "Most or designs are better, so you hardly can find a good design that is much better than.",
            "Whenever you load tools, some company in process to you.",
            "Of course you must come up with a new design and somehow go over that pattern so that they will not Sue.",
            "And get performers that you are meeting.",
            "It is really.",
            "Difficult if you do not have proper tools to optimize and fertilizations on such parts or so difficult that even regular parmeter scanning car notes easy.",
            "Most methods are then used like a genetic algorithms to search for combination of parameters to find the optimum design to have standing wave ratio.",
            "At the proper value.",
            "Adepts is especially right for this Patch.",

            "Our computers force too slow to get any useful result in a meaningful time.",

            "Model more precisely what you want, and horses are quite happy.",
            "Not to pay a lot of documents for patterns, so you can find your own design, it works.",
