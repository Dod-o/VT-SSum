            "It is something that matters or yes, it does matter.",
            "The order matters.",

            "If you want to be optimal, we have to do a full full search in the solution space so the order does matter and what we want to show is that even with a heuristic with this, something that we are working on for future work try to play a little bit with the order of the votes, change it and see if we are going to get better results.",
            "So it is the order in which we process the votes, does matter, and but we're trying to show is that.",
            "You can be close to be optimal even with a heuristic algorithm, and we don't have to do a full brute force search in the solution space.",
            "Hi, this is very interesting work in the experiment that you did with actual users.",
            "If I understand correctly, you started with a known taxonomy and compare and ask the users about it.",
            "Taxonomy some such like the ACM classification system, they may have grown somewhat organically over the years, so they may have some unusual relationships in them.",
            "Have you analyzed what you called wrong answers by your users to see if perhaps the taxonomy wouldn't have been better if those wrong answers were in fact recognized as right?",
            "Excuse me, supposing that I didn't the.",
            "Their own concerns were including in the data set how the taxonomy would would end.",
            "Well, I'm thinking you could look at the wrong answer and see if that person isn't actually right and the taxonomy is wrong.",
            "As as in human review of the wrong on yes yes.",
            "So so you say that we shouldn't probably assume that the ACM taxonomy is a Golden rule taxonomy.",
            "For the experiment, it makes sense to assume that absolutely, but as an extension of that experiment, after the experiment paper, so this it cannot be objectively seen as a Golden rule taxonomy.",
            "The one on the ACM.",
            "And when you when you saw just two terms in front of the users, they have to just choose one of those two.",

            "I was wondering, do you allow to have only one element in your tree so there is only one appearance of be there?",
            "Yeah, in your model there is only one OK, so but it can be the case, for example, that athletic shoes can go both under shoes and both other athletic equipment, which means that you might need to have two which actually take carries on from the question that you had before.",
            "So do you have any plans on how to extend this model to?",
            "To cope for more because if if half of the people vote that athletic shoes are shoes and the other half votes for athletic shoes being athletic equipment.",
            "Then nobody is wrong.",
            "Actually, they're both correct, so you actually need to put this both in your taxonomy.",
            "No, we said what we say.",
            "It is the majority opinion prevail and's I don't know his name asked before the order in which we process the input does matter, so will, if it's 5050 will end up with one of those two arbitrarily and will wait.",
            "Maybe for a user in the future, or a bunch of them just to come and change this state of the taxonomy.",
            "So we can have fun, but involving, yeah, so you assume that there is an objective taxonomy, a Golden rule one, and what we say is there's no Golden Rule taxonomy, taxonomy are subjective and they are up to what most of the users want to be, I mean.",
            "Yeah, one comment.",
            "I think this question is excellent.",
            "Just one one thing I mean, why can't you think that there are several applications in errors in one application scenario?",
            "It would be nice to have a certain subclass structure running another application scenario you exactly want to have the another one right?",
            "So it's about subject.",
            "Yeah, this is also well.",
            "Is this something about maybe you can?",
            "Wait, sorry, answering the question before you can instantiate two taxonomies and let users choose one of them or use any of them in different applications.",
            "So the idea is not to not to sit on the semantical meaning of the of the nodes but just to try to derive the taxonomy according to what most users want.",
            "And we do that approaching the problem in a graph theoretic way.",
            "And well, we we inspect the dynamics on the taxonomy and we believe one.",
            "We believe that this one is something that is subjectively emerges from the crowd and there's no objective taxonomy.",
            "But you can have everything we have to choose either one or the other and probably waiting future votes to change what you build on it now.",
            "So you ask for possible applications of the.",
            "Just one person.",
            "Question.",
            "In several recipes for different applications.",
            "But yeah, right so that was just the current comment.",
            "Also to previous questions.",
            "OK, well we're working on many of.",
            "There are many things we are looking.",
            "Future work and idea is is also like that keep multiple instances of the same group of nodes that forming different taxonomies and every time choosing one of them to go to the next state.",
            "But the problem is a little bit more complicated and we're trying to this point what we're trying to do is to sacrifice some of the running time we need to run the whole algorithm in order to get more qualitative results, be closer to the optimal according to the invariants we set at the beginning.",
            "But we can discuss anything we want offline.",
