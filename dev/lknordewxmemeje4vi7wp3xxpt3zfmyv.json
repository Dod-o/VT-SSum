            "To solve it so that was a modeling part and now the solving part, which is on by the solver.",
            "There are two key principles and.",
            "The first is a propagation of constraints.",
            "So we already said that there's all different constraint.",
            "Now how does it work?",
            "Well if you have for example three variables XY and Z. I know that access the value one.",
            "Why is the value one or two?",
            "So it's not decided yet and that has a value 123 or 4.",
            "Then you know that because X is 1, one cannot appear in the domain of any of the other variables, right?",
            "So you know that why cannot be one.",
            "So you move one from the domain and only the number 2 remains.",
            "And because why is?",
            "Do you know the two cannot be in Z, so it's also removed.",
            "Now I will give an example of how it works on Silicon police, but so the idea that every constraint is implemented by propagator and the propagator reduces the domains of all the variables it is defined on.",
            "And then the second thing is that if all the propagation has happened, there's no more propagation possible.",
            "Then we say that propagation is at a fixed point.",
            "And then we just we branch over the value of a variable.",
            "So you just pick a variable.",
            "You pick one value of it, you sign to it, and then you start propagating again.",
            "Of course, there are smart ways to do this, and it matter in what order.",
            "So these two prints."

        [
            "Polls are reading.",

            "Then does anybody see what the what the next move would be?",
            "So there is a propagation going to happen.",
            "The two yes, so if you look at.",
            "At this row.",
            "Then you see that there can be a tool in these three fields because the two is is there already, there can be 2 either, so the only position that's left for two to be that's here.",
            "So this is exactly what the all different constraint will propagate.",
            "So using the constraint on that role will see a two has to be there.",
            "But now no more propagation can happen or two possible values.",
            "That's four and six.",
            "We don't know, I think.",
            "So what we do is we branch.",
            "We just pick a square, we pick one of the two values.",
            "And now there's only one square left, so we know automatically what value has to be in it, and that is done by propagation of the all different on the square.",

            "The first are the variables, so we assign a variable to every possible item, not the entire matrix, but just every item and also every transaction.",
