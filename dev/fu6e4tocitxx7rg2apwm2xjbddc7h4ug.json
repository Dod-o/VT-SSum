            "Approach in the middle and then the global features on the right.",
            "So.",
            "For most of the class is the local feature.",
            "So basically bag of keypoints type approach works the best, so the best classification is always in bold.",
            "But what's interesting is that for this features where you have a very sort of distinct texture, for example the cheater and the leopard and.",
            "Also possibly the elephant, but that's not so certain, but there this approach based on 1st doing a segmentation and then classifying different segmentation regions works best.",
            "Of course, the problem with the segmentation based approach is that there are losing the contextual information, so for the advantage with the local features you have local features from the background too, and for example for the lion the line is usually seen in a specific type of background and if you have these local features this can be taken.",
