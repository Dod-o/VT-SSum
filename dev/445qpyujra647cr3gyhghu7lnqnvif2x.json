            "My company second Quadrant is busy expanding the codebase, as are many other people, and I'd like to work with you in research consortia to further extend those capabilities if that's possible.",
            "If you're interested in the actual project and what we're doing, and you'd like to stay in touch with that, then I would encourage you to send an email to register at Axel Project Dot EU and will put you on a mailing list where we can send out regular newsletters to update you on the work that we're doing and the successes that we have as they come.",
            "And if you don't manage to do any of those things, then I would say.",
            "One last thing, which is try to disseminate your work as open source, because it really does work as a mechanism for disseminating useful software.",
            "It encourages very broad adoption of that software, and my company is a good example of proof that it can be economically justifiable to work on open source as well.",
            "So thank you very much.",
            "My name is Monica Franceschini and I also work for an open source project for being business.",
            "Intelligence is probably I, and my question is, how do you approach a big data?",
            "You mean that it is possible to deploy Postgres in a distributed environment or gluster?",
            "Or how do you manage the big data volumes that other database do?",
            "Yeah, I mean the customer asked me yesterday what do we do when the database runs out and we hit the limits of the database?",
            "Obviously that's a problem because there isn't any technology that doesn't have a kind of some kind of upper limit.",
            "At the moment we don't support massive massively parallel implementations, so as a single data store there are effective limits to what we can currently achieve.",
            "That's one of the areas that we're working towards.",
            "What we've currently done as part of the actual project is look at.",
            "Algorithmic ways that allow us to manage the big data without needing to do parallel query for example?",
            "So Postgres does not yet do everything I can think of.",
            "A database should be able to do with probably 5 to 10 years away from that and over the course of those five to 10 years.",
            "Will probably think of another five or ten years worth of things to do.",
            "So the thing that I'd like to get your attention on is that databases are an enabling technology, but you also have to invest in further advances in the database technology alongside other advances in other software so.",
            "So what one question you mentioned that in this actual project you are introducing analytics, so can you tell what type of analytics on on what data modalities?",
            "So like text, graphs, images and what kind of operators you would introduce this one question.",
            "The second question would be how these future version of Postgres compares with this.",
            "No SQL databases which are, well, you know popular nowadays.",
            "So this let me speak into the microphone so this this quite a few questions there in terms of the actual project, what we're working on is we're analyzing the results against a number of different datasets, so it's not just a single data set that we're analyzing, and it's not just tabular data that we're working with, so there is a significant effort to make that very broad based, as I said.",
            "Postgres supports very well specified geographical data manipulation functions, including indexing and all sorts of operators designed to make sensible use of that, and will be including that within the research.",
            "In terms of how it relates to no SQL databases.",
            "If you wish to analyze data, you need to have some kind of way of accessing a data store for analytical purposes.",
            "At the moment, SQL is far and away the most dominant access language, and should there be in the future other access languages for data, I'm sure we would support them.",
            "So the access language is not something we're wedded to.",
            "It's an implementation detail.",
            "Thanks, thanks a lot and you, but you do need an access language.",
            "You can't just not have one.",
