            "I was particularly interested in the K choosing problem because I've been working with the research round and oceanography data set and we had this exact K issue and that's what that's what brought me to this particular formulation of the problem.",

            "I don't when we really applied the awesome areas like vision that you really want to target what humans in general would say.",

            "But yeah, so it's going to be a little more loosey Goosey, but what I what I see as being distinctions?",
            "It's not that the human is, is is testing for P values necessarily, but they have some supervisory interaction like they might say, look at these two things should definitely go together in the coming calculate, and they can see how that changes their clustering.",
