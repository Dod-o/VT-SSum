            "When you use emails for tickets, you can use anything in email to select automatically or semiautomatically where the ticket is directed, who is responsible so you can use real like text searches based on ticket quests and space down subjects, but we usually recommend for dissenters to actually set up the form so we don't have to do.",
            "So content based filtering or anything 'cause that's always there slightly.",
            "At prone to some kind of flight, formatting changes that break the system and tend to the delegation is longer and lengthier.",

            "Do you see is your main message here that you know well?",
            "Ticket systems are something very general, but is your main message that in order to make this work you have to couple together the ticketing systems at different centers or will actually be one ticketing system we are planning to do.",
            "Generalize ticketing system, but if it would be possible to do of course like a decentralized version.",
            "A plugin is available, I find it it's quite heavy system already, so perhaps the maintenance in one specific center and we don't really need the scalability here.",
            "The ticketing load is not that high that we would want to decentralize.",
            "It may be much.",
            "Thank you very much.",
            "Very interesting presentation and then to this nice overview of development I would like to ask this.",
            "This is very short question.",
            "Is nervous system available on some make open license?",
            "Do you think about making available to climbing so the odr is back and is is openly available?",
            "They do have Community Edition and and the changes that we have made is in our GitHub that is on the first light as well.",
            "I hope it's alright, great thank you and the next question.",
            "I know the ticketing system from the word software.",
            "Working in programming, but I'm just curious, do you have some?",
            "Maybe feedback from from users from humanities social Sciences?",
            "How how they perceive the system?",
            "Do we react accept?",
            "Are they willing to use this system and that is a good question.",
            "We don't have any way that kind of feedback, but I think that in chlorine at large we have like some kind of user interaction.",
            "But is it working?",
            "Group or something that might be good when we could, of course ask our users as well, but I find that often when you have like these questionnaires on top of like your web forums, people don't really feel it.",
            "Feel them in or provide good feedback.",
            "So I am it would be interesting to know, but like it seems like the fair amount of you, so at least when people are struggling with 30s and need to know how the software works, they will use it.",
            "Thank you, OK?",
            "Question over here.",
            "Good morning yet, but maybe you related question, but first another one.",
            "And how sensible is the system?",
            "For spinning?",
            "I mean you say you can send to mill, but everyone can send once the Mail addresses is known, everyone can sent you Mail.",
            "So previous time in the Netherlands at least, we have a lot of effort to remove all the spin.",
            "So that was the first question and the second question, how easy is it to join you in Germany from the Netherlands using your system?",
            "I'm paying you a little bit of fee.",
            "So yeah, for the first question like.",
            "And there are two layers that we can work for spam like OK, we mails contain spamassassin headers, and if there's a spamassassin that recognizes its permit, it goes to spam.",
            "So it's kind of the same user experience that you would get in your normal uni email and then our student assistance who watched the queue.",
            "An maybe five days a week, at least some hours a day will always just kind of move the spam away, so it's it starts up usually in generic you that most agents most end users won't see and it will go like unnoticed.",
            "For everyone except me and this dude at the systems, basically how easy it is to set up.",
            "So like 2 main things to say that either you have a dedicated email address address or you create a web form and both of those are like putting one PHP page on your web service or just having an email address and telling us what the email addresses or make making it to forwarding the mails to that to our address and telling that.",
            "OK, for this Mail address you should put it into this Q and make this person as a responsible and then we need to get some accounts for the responsibles of course.",
            "But I say it, but it's really lightweight to maintain.",
            "Yeah, I mean, uh related question might be, should Claire and Eric buy into this and you know, should this be your applied ticketing system?",
            "I mean, I'm not sorry, find the best to answer that, but like I mean if there is a demand for, like a user questions, inquiring Eric level, I mean it would make sense by not.",
            "OK, more questions we have.",
            "We have some time.",
            "Few minutes.",
