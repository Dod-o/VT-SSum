            "There's plenty of time for questions.",
            "In fluorescence correlation spectroscopy there or there's also a lot of photophysics effects on the correlation curves and on the left side.",
            "Did you have any problems with it or there?",
            "Yeah, we did.",
            "We did actually and these some of these lipids, especially in the pretty unpopular membrane environment.",
            "Suddenly we saw that there was an additional downstate in there, but you can.",
            "You can make make controls and I didn't talk about all these controls.",
            "I could fill the whole 45 minute talk about controls for all of these experiments.",
            "'cause of course first of all you put a die on a label every time you change the molecule.",
            "So is it still the same molecule?",
            "It's not, of course, but you can do controls whether how much did die influences, then you have to check how much what's the flu.",
            "Since characteristic of the dye and one of those things is this, so we did that.",
            "We can incorporate this into the fitting.",
            "And it's no problem so.",
            "On your first slide, you showed a very nice 3D image of a diesel in the resting state super resolution.",
            "How did you keep it in the resting state?",
            "The problem?",
            "I mean, we talked about this earlier.",
            "The problem about these T cells the moment they touched any surface because they're so sensitive to their environment, they do something they trigger.",
            "And of course, I said we usually activate them by coating a surface or making a surface that presents antigens.",
            "Now, if you just make a surface that doesn't present any antigens and you put the T cells on top, there still spreads and it still triggers calcium.",
            "So that's really an issue.",
            "So you have to keep them in suspension now, keeping T cells in suspension therein lies around the image you seen showed that, but they just float around.",
            "You don't have time to capture them, so we put them in certain buffer conditions.",
            "Well, they don't float around so much, but they are still roughly, so that's just like conditions.",
            "That's what we did.",
            "It's pretty tough to create this kind of buffer condition, so there any other ideas are more than welcome to to hear them, but this is a key feature.",
            "That's the first thing we started when we started our group and we started working.",
            "We first thought, hey, this is the first thing we have to get going that we are able to investigate the T cells in the resting state cause to understand the molecular mechanisms you have to understand.",
            "How much is clustered in the resting state?",
            "For example, is there any might of these micro clusters that you've seen?",
            "Any of these also present in the resting state?",
            "That's what we're investigating at the moment.",
            "Very nice work.",
            "I was wondering what happens to this green fluorescent protein when you switch it on and off or it's it's a.",
            "It's a it's a confirmed information station.",
            "It's between its entrance state and one of these states that the fluid for comes close to and.",
            "Molecules that quench the fluorescence, so this is not very fast.",
            "Or is it?",
            "No it's not bad.",
            "It's not very far, it's not very fast, because these these these different states are stabilized by hydrogen bonds.",
            "To switch them, you don't need much energy, but there since they are stabilized, usually they are stable for seconds to minutes.",
            "So you switch it in one seconds or microseconds microsecond.",
            "Depends of course on the on the light dose that we put in well simulated emission.",
            "You have to be faster than the lifetime of the excited state, so you have to be fast and NS.",
            "That's the big advantage of step, because it's in sustainment instantaneous.",
            "That's why we still use that and try to improve it.",
            "Thanks if we would could get.",
            "Is that we talked about quantum dots.",
            "For example states.",
            "I mean if we could get them working instead, perfect probes.",
            "But as I said also these nanodiamonds, they were a great playground for.",
            "I don't know 3 four years.",
            "We just use these nanodiamonds to try out new things.",
            "What we can do with that and so on.",
            "But we didn't get them to work as a label.",
            "Why can't you functionalize them?",
            "It's carbon rights.",
            "Carbon so?",
            "It's tough, they're very hydrophobic, and to get them functionalized the aggregate.",
            "So chemists have that under control.",
            "But to really specific label, something is still very difficult, and the surface chemistry of carbon seems to be a big problem, especially on the small spatial scales.",
            "So like in this carbon nanotubes right, exactly exactly exactly very similar.",
            "Are there more questions?",
            "In $1000 technique, do you jump to the next point or you fly over the specimens?",
            "We continuously scan, but of course in the recording you make a discrete so you record every.",
            "I don't know millisecond or something like that.",
            "There was a question on you.",
            "Images are detected by some sensors.",
            "You change detectors sensors, so most of the state record is where you use singlepoint scanning.",
            "You use these single photon counting detectors like.",
            "Like avalanche, photodiodes or something like this for this thousand Donuts, we use a camera because we want to image everything at once.",
            "The advantage of the single point stuff is that you get the image right away, you just reconstruct the image position and you get you see what you get.",
            "That's the nice thing about step.",
            "If you do anything wrong, you don't get a nice image.",
            "All these other techniques that work with camera based also this structure illumination you have to do a lot of math, so black box for a lot of people.",
            "And of course you have some para meters there.",
            "We can tune and then you.",
            "That's the danger then.",
            "Then people don't.",
            "There's a threshold para meter and then the image doesn't look that nice and you squeeze the threshold a little bit and suddenly all this is nice you so you get it, get rid of all the bad features, lets the danger of doing this really simply only image analysis based techniques.",
            "But there are the people are really developing nice checking tools to avoid that.",
            "Your lasers are probably nanosecond pulses, or we well usually picoseconds picosecond.",
            "So we start off we started off with these Tetons sapphire lasers went through a long fiber so that we had roughly 100 picosecond 200 people.",
            "Second pauses, but nowadays we even work with 800 picosecond pulses and then the distance between pulses.",
            "No, but between excitation excitation and it still calls it's it's.",
            "That's why usually the excitation pulse is roughly 80 to 100 picoseconds.",
            "And that's why if we make the step poles brought out, we can completely overlap it so that there is no danger of having any, any spontaneous floors and submission.",
            "What's your opinion on rafts then raft?",
            "There's something the lipid environment and you will everybody who will hear me in 2 days will see there is something the lipid environment influences the the protein functionality, but this traditional raft model that you really have floating rafts and AIDS.",
            "It's nonsense.",
            "But there is something and if we carry this on we see certain hotspots only this trapping that would have been my next data is that we see this trapping interactions only in certain parts of the cell.",
            "So these hotspots they have to do something, some functionality we haven't found.",
            "We didn't find the link to functionality yet, but there is something.",
            "Kisum unsupported he said he likes our data because his recent review is and that comes from is that lipid rafts are transient.",
            "Lipids mediated hotspots, so to say.",
            "And that's exactly what we see.",
            "We just have to what I would like to find out whether the lipids play an active part or passive part.",
            "And that's what we have to see.",
            "Do they really just mediate it, or do they really drive it?",
            "I think it's the mediation because more and more, the more we dig into this, the most important part is the acting side is good.",
