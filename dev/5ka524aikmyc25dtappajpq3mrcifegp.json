            "Alright, so here's the problem.",
            "So we have all these various linked open data and linked open services that I think have probably already been discussed in this meeting.",
            "So you really have this sort of vast collection of linked information, and potentially it's quite useful.",
            "There's a lot of the semantic web in the last few years.",
            "In fact.",
            "Is this whole move the link data stuff?",
            "I think it's actually quite interesting and people should actually paying attention to it.",
            "And so there's all these various sources and services, and they all have very schemas and stuff.",
            "But one of the issues is that you don't necessarily.",
            "I mean, we've gone from one end.",
            "The semantic web used to be all about ontologies and descriptions and reasoning languages and stuff, and there was no data, right?",
            "People used to look around?",
            "OK, we have all these great tools, but no one has any data.",
            "And then the link data stuff came around along and all of a sudden there was all this data available.",
            "People publish tons of data and stuff, but if you look at a lot of the information that's being published, there's very little semantics.",
            "I mean, there's very little information describing the data.",
            "And this is a problem, right?",
            "Because if you really want to sort of realize the vision of the semantic web, not just the link data part of it, then it involved actually having sort of knowledge about the information sort of understanding what the data was.",
            "So we have all this information and so."
        ],
        [
            "The challenge then is you know where do semantics actually come from?",
            "Where do we get this information about the data?",

            "It doesn't happen.",
            "People are very happy to publish data link data into the link data linked open data today, but typically what's happening today is that information is basically being populated manually, so people are sort of by manually.",
            "I mean they go and they say OK.",
            "I'm going to link my data source, published my data source into linked open data, and then they're either manually linking the information.",
            "So for example, the New York Times has.",
            "Full time curators that very carefully link the information you know from their metadata repository into.",
            "When I link it to DB pedia, they're actually linking the actual instances in today, Peter, but that's you know, that's like a 10 year effort, right?",
            "So they've decided to two full time people would expect to finish that over 10 years.",
            "And I have all their metadata very carefully curated and linked, but that will just be sort of the linking information other people actually writing procedures, right?",
            "So they say, OK, I'm going to link my data source into the link data cloud by essentially running a procedure that tells it OK, why don't you match on this field?",
            "And then you'll decide which.",
            "Things are linked those, but those just define the links we don't actually know how the sources are actually related.",
            "It's sort of a higher level.",
            "We know how the instances are related, not how the entire sources are related, because if I take some new source about geospatial data, and I do a bunch of links there, well, then what I have is a set of instances that are linked.",
            "Overall, I don't know how the sources relate to each other, so in many cases there's no or very limited sort of semantic descriptions of the sources, so that's an issue.",
            "Then we have linked open services where today these are essentially manually constructed or.",
            "Where you actually build the service from scratch to provide some information, or they're built by wrapping existing web services and the description or the mapping of these is done by constructing these lifting and lowering rules where you're writing these sparkle queries that basically described the mappings in the queries between these things.",
            "And that's essentially how you're relating these services into.",
            "Existing ontologies and this.",
            "This is hard.",
            "This is really a difficult task.",

            "I'm sure you guys will do it, but you guys will have a whole week summer school to learn how to do this, but.",
            "Yeah, it's quite.",
            "It's quite challenging to actually do it, and when it's done in fact what you have is a description, really a partial description.",
            "You have a description of the inputs and you have a description of the outputs, but you don't actually have a description necessarily exactly what the relationship is between the inputs and outputs, right?",
            "What's the essentially the function is implemented by these things, and that's not always required, but it's actually can be extremely useful if you're trying to do other things with the service.",
            "If you're trying to actually do, for example, automatic composition of services, which is one of the things we want to do.",
            "Then you need that type of information, which is what's the exact relationship between these inputs and outputs.",
            "Certainly.",
            "One that you're making is that the descriptions of data sources and services are limited, but my question is now, don't you think that these descriptions?",
            "Will always be an approximation and will always be limited in the sense.",
            "No, that's a great question, right?",
            "So right, it's very hard to write precise descriptions and have them 100% correct, but in other hand, without some general type of description, it makes it much harder to do other kinds of things with sources.",
            "So, for example, the kinds of things we like to do with sources is actually automatic query answering an automatic composition of the sources, and so you need these kind of encryptions just to know what sources even relevant, right?",
            "Yeah, more than that.",
            "Arbitrary computation that you abstract the service boundary.",
            "It's not just difficult, it's impossible to get a price.",
            "Precise description of an arbitrary service, and have them come parable.",
            "'cause that's going to Lincoln please?",
            "OK, yeah.",
            "So you have to make an approximation, yes, but I still argue that it's still a very important task to do right there.",
            "To find the fragments in which approximations are sensible.",
            "To make those comparisons to do I mean it will give you an example we expect to link data, right?",
            "I may have a source that has a very nice detailed ontology and public people publish other sources that have no ontological descriptions over.",
            "There is no.",
            "I mean, it's just one giant class and a whole bunch of instances of that class.",
            "And so to actually really effectively use that source for other kinds of things where you really would like to understand.",
            "What the information is here and now there's an opportunity here because I've linked all the instances, right?",
            "So I actually are many of the instances here, and so now there's an opportunity where we can exploit the linked data to actually help me create through Smith descriptions, which I'm going to.",
            "My second question was, I do agree when you say that we need more detailed and additional information in order to make something to make sense out of this data and use the services effectively, but.",

            "Up till now, which is that the problem of creating these men descriptions is sufficiently hard that people don't do it?",

            "So the idea is that we can actually build these kinds of services, taking, you know, deep web sources, which are things like, you know, online services that are maybe behind forms or web services, or those kinds of things and actually create the service descriptions automatically.",

            "Were all instances belong to the single class feature and it can be specialized in various ways so you can actually specialize it.",
            "But in terms of the classes themselves, you actually have to specialize it by adding additional restrictions on the classes to get that.",
            "And this is simply because I mean this is not uncommon, because what's happening here is someone took the Jew Names Database and says, oh, I'm going to publish this in linked data, and they essentially derived the linked data directly from the RDBMS schema, right?",
            "So it's in a relational database.",
            "It's organized as feature and it's just a tool where they can take it and publish it as RDF data and then do the linkage of the instances into other data.",
            "That's out there.",
            "And so it's very straightforward to do this, and if you look at sort of the link data cloud which has all of those different sources there, well, that's how a lot of people have published data, right?",
            "So there's you know, there's these tools D2R, which you know you can basically go to your source and very quickly just map it into RDF, and then you have some method for them doing the linkage, and suddenly I've got a node in the cloud, But the problem is that I have just a note in the cloud with respect to the instances, right?",
            "So I've mapped the data source into a set of instances.",
            "I've linked the instances but it says nothing about the relationships.",
            "The ontology level.",
            "So we want to know what these relationships are, right?",

            "Or it might have another case where I have something like gene names which really doesn't have much more ontology at all.",
            "They really just has, you know, a single class, and so you'd really like to be able to come up with ways of actually specializing the existing ontology for gene names, which is quite simple into something that's much richer and much more useful.",
            "OK, so how do we do it?"
        ],
        [
            "So one of the problems in doing this is that if we just look at the existing mappings.",
            "So if we take June names and we take pedia, then what we see here is that OK since June names has this class feature and then I have everything, all my instances are a member of this class feature and then I have the pedia which can be much more fine grained.",
            "So I could have educational institution and University in California is a member of this class educational institution.",
            "But it's also a member over here of Deep CrossFit.",

            "Between these two sources.",
            "OK, so in order to deal with that problem, we have to look at what are called restriction classes.",
            "So restriction class is essentially a specialized class that you can create by restricting the value of one or more properties.",
            "OK, so that really just means that I can take something like this original jeans class feature, and I can add additional restriction to it.",

            "Essentially this these restriction classes define a graph, right?",
            "So you essentially have this property that any restriction class, any instance pulling district in class also belongs to the parent of that restriction class.",
            "So at the top I don't know if you can read this in the back, but this says you know RDF type equals D names.",
            "Feature feature code equals G names dot A dot PS dot CLI.",
            "The details aren't particular important here.",
            "The idea though, is that what's happening you have these separate essentially features and then I can start composing them together.",

            "I can exploit the fact that, well, this you know this property if it belongs to restriction class is going to belong to the parents classes and stuff.",
            "So that will help me in my search through this space of restriction classes, yes.",
            "So a restriction class is really just taking your class.",

            "What is actually contained in the source, so it may be that this is the class of schools and maybe their original intention was that was the class of all schools in the world, but it might turn out from this one source that they only have schools in the US, and this other source has schools throughout the world and you want to understand those differences.",
