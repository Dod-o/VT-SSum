            "So welcome to the afternoon everyone, I'm.",
            "Michael Lees I sent you all an email awhile ago about preparation for the afternoon sessions.",
            "So we will learn something about networks, the structure of the days will be something like the following.",
            "I will give a lecture about some concepts and then we will do some practical kind of playing around with some datasets that I've got to give you a feeling of how to analyze networks and how to model things on networks.",
            "Well, the objective is by next Wednesday.",
            "Is that we have some groups of you who are willing to give presentations about something you managed to produce within a week.",
            "So I already want you to start thinking about that.",
            "Last year was surprisingly successful.",
            "We had about five groups and they managed to do quite a lot in within five days, so my expectations are high again this year.",
            "It does mean that you might have to work over the weekend and.",
            "You are asked to form your own teams, so before we start I would like a show of hands.",
            "How many people have never programmed in any programming language ever before?",
            "Four people so you need to pick good teammates.",
            "You can, you can follow the whole the whole all the lectures or the program you can follow.",
            "The idea that I can teach you in five days how to program everything.",
            "Might be ambitious, but you should be able to get some concepts.",
            "Will be programming in Python?",
            "How many of you have programmed in Python before?",
            "So these are the teammates that you should look for OK?",
            "How many of you used Network X before?",
            "OK, so these guys, they're really the teammates you should look for.",
            "We also use another tool called Gaffey which is for visualizing networks.",
            "Can make nice pictures and it can also help you understand some things about the network structure and it has algorithms to calculate the kind of concepts that we learn in the lectures.",
            "The way we did it last year, and I think we'll do the same thing this year is tomorrow.",
            "I will give.",
            "The lecture will do some practical work, but then I want to reserve about half an hour where it's basically like a speed dating for finding your teammates.",
            "So you were all asked to bring a data set of your own to the school.",
            "How many of you have got something which you would consider an interesting data set?",
            "OK, they all seem to be set together couple over there.",
            "So what we did last year and I think we'll do the same this year.",
            "I will give you each like 5 minutes to pitch your data set and hopefully try and find people to help you work on on your data set.",
            "So if you're in the middle of your PhD, you have a really tough problem then this is the opportunity to get other people to work for you.",
            "So probably towards the end of tomorrow afternoon, you'll have that opportunity to say, OK, this is what my data set is.",
            "This is what it contains and these are the kind of questions I might think about.",
            "And then me and also the other TAS will will try and help you formulate those in terms of network questions.",
            "All the code that I give you all the practical sessions that I give you.",
            "You're free to use that code yourself as well, and hopefully I've designed it in a way that it's fairly easy to take pieces out and just apply it to your data set.",
            "We will be looking at one data set in particular, which is the airline network across across the globe.",
            "So nodes in that network will be airports and connections exist.",
            "If there's one flight that flies between between those airports, so we'll look at the statistics of that, and then we'll also try and destroy it and see how quickly it starts to fall apart.",
            "The code that I give you is geared towards using the airline network.",
            "What it should be in principle is you just take out the airline network and plug your network in and you can do the same kind of analysis, same kind of statistics.",
            "OK, also before I start so we have people helping.",
            "So if you do get stuck I don't want to be waiting for one person for the whole class.",
            "So if you do get stuck, there's three people who are here to help.",
            "See he's so good that he stood up without even asking him to stand up as Vivek and Joey and.",
            "See, that's Valentin, so if you raise your hand if something's not working with your computer explodes, these guys can fix it OK. And then if it's a big problem for everyone, then just make a bit of noise and I'll stop OK. Um?",
            "Now.",
            "Apart from two of you, you all said that you followed my instructions and everything works.",
            "So I just want to check that and make sure that everyone knows what I mean by by working.",
            "So I ask you all to install this system called Anaconda, which is basically Python with some libraries pre installed and then I ask you to install three extra libraries yourself, one that did power law fits, one that did some timing stuff and so on.",
            "But I do have a test so.",
            "If you're on Mac, Windows, or Linux, you can run the Anaconda Navigator, which will look like this.",
            "The yellow will go off in a second.",
            "Once you start this navigator, what you're looking for is the Jupiter notebooks.",
            "So Jupiter notebooks or Ipython notebooks as they used to be called are very nice teaching tools for programming.",
            "It's a bit like a if you've used.",
            "Mathematica or these kind of tools where you have a notebook which is got bits of text interleaved with bits of code.",
            "So you have some written text, then a bit of code, and as you read the text and understand what the code does, you can execute it and you just go through and execute these things.",
            "So all the code that I give you will be on the Ipython notebooks or Jupiter notebooks.",
            "So if I launch this.",
            "Something happens.",
            "So in the market starts doing these kind of strange things in the terminal that's just starting everything they need, and eventually what should happen is a browser should pop up.",
            "It's probably 'cause I've already got it open.",
            "But it looks like this.",
            "What I will then do is navigate to the folder where you downloaded my code.",
            "So in the instructions there is some.",
            "Things there so.",
            "I have to navigate to the right directories, which for me is a bit of a.",
            "So eventually I get here.",
            "And I'm in here.",
            "So there are four Ipython notebooks.",
            "What I want you to test before I start is 0 is introduction and set up.",
            "If I click on this.",
            "It starts that Ipython notebook.",
            "It gives you some overview of this course, So what the four lectures are, we don't do.",
            "Yeah, but we do all of this.",
            "Actually we do all four of these things.",
            "It gives you some instructions which you can ignore.",
            "What I want you to do is go to this.",
            "You'll notice that this is different to the text.",
            "Something that has a little in and it looks a bit more like a Courier font.",
            "That is code that we can execute.",
            "These things are called cells.",
            "And you execute them one by one to execute it.",
            "All I have to do is press shift and enter.",
            "I can also do it from here.",
            "Do, sell, run, sell, Run, sells all above and so on.",
            "Now if everything has worked like you said it had, if I press shift return here.",
            "What it's trying to do is import all the libraries that it needs for the rest of the course.",
            "If anything fails, it will tell you with a warning that something has gone wrong.",
            "If everything is OK, it was print all OK. You'll notice at the end.",
            "Now it has a star next to it.",
            "Now it has a warm when the system is still running, it will have a start there, so if you if you're going through one of these notebooks in the future and you keep pressing shift return nothings happening, just look back and make sure.",
            "That it's maybe one of the cells that you executed previously.",
            "It's still actually running.",
            "Some of the calculations that we do will take some time, so you just have to be a bit patient.",
            "So if you see this, then you're guaranteed to be OK. Well, not guaranteed.",
            "But everything should be all OK. OK, so if you don't have that when you press shift return.",
            "You can raise your hand and one of the Wizards will come and fix your problems.",
            "OK. One more thing, before two more things before I start the lecture.",
            "So we also made a Facebook.",
            "Group.",
            "So you I think you were all invited to join the Facebook group.",
            "The idea of the Facebook group is to allow you to meet one another but also share your datasets and try and find teammates.",
            "Some of you will now I notice already on that Facebook group.",
            "I also introduce you to this book.",
            "So all the slides that I give you and all the material that I give you is based off material from Laszlo Barabasi.",
            "He also has a free ebook which is online.",
            "And you'll find a lot of the material that I give.",

            "So this is a really nice thing.",
            "It has a kind of a nice.",
            "There are PDF versions as well, but you can read online with nice interactive demos.",
            "So if I if you miss something that I've said or it goes too fast, you can have a look at this book and it will have everything that I cover and more.",
            "So join the Facebook Group and have a look at the book.",
            "I'll tell you a bit about this network, so this network is my Facebook network.",
            "So a while ago, you Facebook still allowed you to get download the data from your own Facebook.",
            "These are all my friends.",

            "So we're friends in common.",
            "Basically.",
            "So this network has a way of kind of measuring how rumors might spread about me in in social media so.",

            "What we learn today is actually how to measure statistics about the network, which can tell us how important the nodes are.",
            "And if we want to stop a rumor spread or a disease spread or whatever, how we should target those nodes based on the statistics and the measures.",
            "Unfortunately, for me, this person in the middle who is very very important in every way is is my wife so.",

            "And they found, like $10,000,000 of US currency, something else and millions of dollars of jewelry and whatever, but the most vital thing from that raid was they found a photo album of the Hussein family.",
            "And from that they started to piece together the social connections of Saddam Hussein.",
            "So his friends, his family and so on.",
            "And this is what they started to build.",
            "And after a while it started to point to two people, in particular this Mohammed Ibrahim, and this Rudman, Ibrahim, which I think they were.",

            "But in the hierarchy they were like really not very important.",
            "They were secondary bodyguards, of which there were 40 and they were doing things like collecting his laundry and doing other things.",
            "But socially they were quite close.",
            "So also the story goes that Redman was captured and within half an hour he had a heart attack.",
            "So how I don't know, but he died almost instantly, so they kind of illuminated him and he was no choice.",
            "Eventually they managed to track down Muhammad and they found someone who was connected to Muhammad.",
            "Mohammed, directly.",
            "It was somebody working from home and the guy who was working for Mohammed was the one that took them to the small hole where Saddam was hiding.",

            "And it has capacity.",
            "So when you run power through a network of power network, it has to go somewhere so you have substations.",
            "You have power stations, you have the houses that are using the power.",

            "If the system is configured in such a way and it leads to such a way.",
            "If that keeps happening actually after just a few kind of subsequent failures, you start to get a huge cascade.",

            "Yeah I can.",
            "I'll start again.",
            "It was only a couple of steps.",
            "So just open Gaffey.",
            "File open.",
            "And then open the edge list.",
            "Selected as directed.",
            "And click OK. Mixed what it will do is it will say OK.",
            "If it has information.",
            "So it has A to be.",
            "Then it will assume it has B2A.",
            "It will show in this case that it's directed, but in some cases you might not have the repeat route, so it might take B to C and it will automatically try and figure out whether this should be undirected edge.",
            "So if it has no information and these are directed, you want to assume that this is an undirected edge.",
            "So you allow for directed and undirected edges, so we don't want that.",
            "Because all the path calculations are between the centrality, everything that we calculate needs to know whether we should follow the edges or not.",
            "OK, did that work?",
            "So sometimes what you have to do is this thing you'll notice around the interface that there's all these little crosses, so you can actually close these subwindows.",

            "There's a couple of things we can do now.",

            "This is between the centrality and so on.",
            "What we can also do is rearrange this this picture to actually try and distill some kind of insights from what's going on, so I'll go through the steps of how to do this.",
            "So on the right hand side you'll see this little window with filters and statistics.",
            "So the thing that you want to look at is statistics.",
            "So this is where your you can run the algorithms.",
            "Now when you do these calculations, there are some things that you can calculate at the same time.",
            "So you remember the betweena centrality?",
            "We have to calculate all shortest paths.",
            "Right?",
            "Also, for closeness centrality we want to calculate shortest paths.",
            "So when you run these things, it actually does one operation, calculate shortest pass, and then it can drive this statistics from that one operation just makes things a bit more efficient.",
            "So if I run the average degree.",
            "Starts doing something, then I get this this report.",
            "So this is not a log log plot.",
            "This is showing me the.",
            "All the airlines, So what what it's saying is this is the degree right?",
            "This is total degree in and out added together so it's incoming routes and outgoing routes incoming and outgoing.",
            "So you see, this one red dot here.",
            "This means is 1 airport with over 500 routes in and out going together.",
            "Well, there's not many of them with this kind of number, there's a few around this kind of regime.",
            "There were a lot of airports with only a few.",
            "So this data set includes all the very, very small provincial airports that you would find in the US in Alaska, and places like this that only have one commercial route going into them or out.",
            "And that's going to be the majority of them.",
            "And then also separates the in degree in the out degree.",
            "So you see these and these things look more less the same so.",
            "The incoming routes and outgoing routes usually correlated.",
            "It also tells me the average degree, so the average number of routes coming in an outgoing from an airport is 12.",
            "So that gives you an idea that even though you think most airports have a lot of routes, most of the small ones, they don't have any commercial activity.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Did you?",
            "Did you pick directed?",
            "OK, I'll.",
            "Who else got 24?",
            "Who got 12?",
            "OK. Let's not worry about it.",
            "For now there will be some kind of some kind of issue, but let's just carry on.",
            "How many people are stuck?",
            "Just raise your hand if you're stuck.",
            "OK, good.",
            "OK, we run some other calculations.",
            "You can do this at the same time, so diameter.",
            "Will an I want to say this is directed?",
            "This will at the same time as calculating the diameter of the network it will calculate the between US and the closeness and something else called the eccentricity which we won't bother with run that.",
            "Well, I also want you to run as modularity.",
            "I'll explain what this does later.",
            "These things take a bit more time, right?",
            "Depending on depending on your computer, calculating the path length from every pair of nodes is an N squared problem.",
            "But it's going to take time.",
            "OK.",
            "So my diameter came out of 13.",
            "Did anyone get anything different?",
            "13 OK. Yeah.",
            "Is everyone here?",
            "So when we calculated the diameter, it also calculated the average path length.",
            "So the average path length is 4.",
            "So what does this mean about the airline network?",
            "Well, it's.",
            "Well, what does it mean about trying to get somewhere?",
            "So on average, if I pick any any origin and destination on average, I need to make 4 transfers.",
            "Assuming no other mode of transport really from airport to airport.",
            "It's four hops.",
            "So you got the origin 123.",
            "Yeah so yeah.",
            "So what about the diameter?",
            "What does the diameter say?",
            "So diameter is 13.",
            "The airline network has a diameter of 13 diameter.",
            "Remember is the.",
            "Longest shortest path.",
            "So if I wanted to make my give myself a really fun holiday, I could find those two airports and take 13 transfers to get from one place to the other.",
            "There's probably more efficient ways to get to these two airports.",
            "I haven't actually looked at which airports they are, but they're going to be at the periphery of the airline network.",
            "They're going to be very small airports, probably in Alaska, and probably small airports in New Zealand or somewhere else.",
            "But that's the worst case.",
            "I mean typically when you use the airline network, you're transferring from Hub to Hub, so that's why an average of four doesn't make sense.",
            "It's going to be 2.",
            "'cause you're going to be transferring from the major cities.",
            "There is a way to.",
            "To consider that and I'll show you that now.",
            "And we'll see what happens.",
            "Did everyone get to the stage?",
            "Yeah.",
            "So what you can also do is what are called filters, and these are going to remove parts of the network based on some measure.",
            "So what I can say is like I just explained, I don't want to consider the small airports, so anything with a less than 50 routes incoming or outcoming I throw away.",
            "I don't throw away, but I just filter them out of my calculations.",
            "So the way I do that, I go to the topology and I get degree range.",
            "And this says I only want to consider nodes in the network that are in this degree range.",
            "So I drag this over to here where it says.",
            "And then this is the degree range, so the maximum is finding 19 roots and I drag this.",
            "OK, and you'll see even at 157.",
            "This little this schematic at the bottom is telling me how much of the distribution I've got.",
            "So by taking it just 157, I've thrown away most of the airports, so let's try 150, yeah?",
            "50 If you will get exactly 150 OK, I press filter and then what they will do is it will remove the nodes which are.",
            "Below 150 you see you now get a totally different looking network.",
            "So now I can re run.",
            "These calculations.",
            "So when I two things, you notice that it's much faster because the network is a lot smaller.",
            "And also now my average path length, the network diameter is 3.",
            "So that's a maximum of transfers I have to take to this.",
            "The major airports is 3 and the average path length is 1.6.",
            "So this is making a lot more sense now, right?",
            "This is what you would typically see for the kind of airports that you are using.",
            "So all of these calculations now will be.",
            "Changing obviously now the average degree is 43, so all these airports have like 43 routes.",
            "OK, I will stop this and I put everything back and now I get so I just click stop and then the filter is not applied anymore.",
            "I can apply subsequent filters so I can if I have weights on the edges or something like this, I can remove different parts so you can have a look through all these filters and see what they mean.",
            "OK, now what I want to do is I want to make this try and.",
            "Look nice or make a bit more sense.",
            "I want to be able to see the picture and see if I can learn something about the network.",
            "Let's say before I do that, then maybe I should show you also.",
            "What's in the data laboratory now?",
            "So if you click on the data about you now it has a row for every node in the network.",
            "And as we were running those statistics, what it was doing is it's putting each of the statistics that you calculated.",
            "In the columns.",
            "So these are all the things that we calculated by running those statistics.",
            "So we've got the indegree, the outdegree, the eccentricity, the closeness centrality, the harmonic closeness between us modularity class.",
            "What I can do is I can click on in particular node and I can now sort this as well so I can find out.",
            "Let's not do it this way.",
            "'cause it kind of gives the game away, but I can pick up ticular node.",
            "I can right click on it and say, select an overview and then go back to overview and it will have zoomed into that node so I can find it on the network.",
            "I can also do the reverse so pick a node I right click on it and say select in data laboratory.",
            "And then I find this where it is in the.",
            "It will direct you to the particular row that that that notice focused on.",
            "OK, so one thing that I did calculate that I have not explained to you is the modularity class.",
            "So we run that algorithm called modularity.",
            "What modularity does is it tries to identify communities Subcommunities in the network.",
            "So it's trying to find groups like the My Friends.",
            "That are highly connected together and don't have many connections to the external world.",
            "So say again.",
            "On the statistics thing, there's a little button, which is modularity, so an overview.",
            "Here just.",
            "You just click run there and it will identify the groups in the network.",
            "So these are groups of nodes that are highly connected together and have less connections to other nodes in the network.",
            "What will these groups be in the airline network?",
            "Countries.",
            "What will the groups be?",
            "Countries, maybe not always countries, but.",
            "Could be coincidence, right?",
            "And the way actually calculates what is a cluster and what is a group that is not.",
            "It depends on how you run the algorithm.",
            "But we expect to see spatially.",
            "Relevant features in the clusters.",
            "So airports which are close together are likely to more like to have routes between each other and then we'll expect those to be to be groups.",
            "And that's what we will hopefully see.",
            "So if you get zoomed in like this, what you can do is just press.",
            "This button and that will so it's a little icon on the left.",
            "That will reset the zoom and get the whole networking OK.",
            "So this is this is a mess we can't really see anything about this network, so the first thing we're going to do is what's called the layout algorithm.",
            "And you see this on the bottom left.",
            "There are different algorithms that you can run to layout to the airport.",
            "Now what I suggest.",
            "If you gotta lower if you gotta lower end computer or even a faster computer, we can filter part of the network out will throw away some of the smaller airports and make life a bit faster.",
            "Little bit easier.",
            "So I'm gonna go back to my filters.",
            "I'm going to apply my degree range.",
            "I'm not going to be so restrictive, but I'm going to say OK throw away all airports with less than 39 routes.",
            "OK, now I get this.",
            "The layout algorithms work by looking at the connections.",
            "So if most of them what they will do is if two nodes are connected and are clustered together so they have friends in common, it will try and put them together in space.",
            "If they are far apart in the network in terms of the number of hops, their closeness, they will try and spread them out further, but it's not a very easy problem to solve, and the more nodes you have more constraints are and the longer it will take to resolve to something that's interesting.",
            "So by filtering we're also going to make the layout algorithms faster.",
            "So the way the algorithm the way these layout algorithms work well I just explained, but they some of them will run continuously and you have to press stop.",
            "Some will have a termination condition and say OK. Once I've satisfied these constraints, my layout is done.",
            "They will also run subsequent to each other, so if I do layout one and then layout to the initial conditions are going to be determined by layout one.",
            "So to make a nice picture, it's somewhat a black art, 'cause if you run algorithm may then be in a bit more of a then C, then D then you might get something that looks nice.",
            "So I'll try my best to make something that, but if I don't succeed then that's why.",
            "So all of these layout algorithms you will find references in the literature to describe how they work, but for now we don't care 'cause we just want to make sure they they work or do something.",
            "They also have parameters.",
            "They also tell you what those parameters do.",
            "So an optimal distance, the natural length of the Springs, bigger values means the nodes will be further apart.",
            "So if I increase that value of 100 to 200, my network is going to be spread out further.",
            "OK, I'm just going to run this algorithm and see what happens.",
            "OK. Wasn't particularly good.",
            "It doesn't really give me anything.",
            "There's another one which is good, which is called Force Atlas 2.",
            "OK. Now I've got something that looks a bit better, so I can also add stronger gravity.",
            "Now I don't want that.",
            "There's an option here to dissuade hubs, so the hubs.",
            "I don't think the word identity was mentioned.",
            "The hubs are the nodes with really high degree.",
            "So the nodes which are going to be very important.",
            "I want to kind of dissuade them from the rest of the network so I can clearly see them.",
            "So I tried that.",
            "Lyn lock modes.",
            "OK, well that's going to make things a bit more spread out, prevent overlap.",
            "That's going to mean once I scaled the nodes to a certain size, I don't want it to actually overlap in the layout.",
            "OK, so I'm going to leave it like that for now.",
            "I still don't know what's going on, but I gotta at least I start to see some structure in the network.",
            "Did anyone get a picture like this?",
            "Something similar it's not going to be exactly the same, because the algorithm is also nondeterministic, right?",
            "And the way you lay out the things in them in the beginning when it loads everything in there, it randomly places the nodes and all the layout algorithms depend on the initial conditions.",
            "So you're never going to get the same layout twice.",
            "Approximately yes, but never the same.",
            "Well, unless you're very very lucky.",
            "OK, so next thing we can do.",
            "OK, there's two people, yeah.",
            "Where is volunteer?",
            "OK.",
            "So now I'm going to try and color the nodes and also scale the nodes depending on different properties.",
            "OK, so.",
            "You'll see there's an appearance thing in the top left.",
            "If you don't see any of these windows, just go to window and then click appearance.",
            "So if I close this.",
            "Then go to window appearance.",
            "It will come back.",
            "So I've got two options.",
            "I can change the appearance of the nodes and the edges.",
            "Right?",
            "So I'm just going to focus on the nodes and then these icons mean something very, very intuitive.",
            "This little palette means the color, so I can change the color.",
            "This little thing that looks like I don't know what, like an eyeball that's the size so I can scale the size of the nodes depending on different things and I can change the label color if I put labels on the nodes and so on.",
            "So let's try first changing the size.",
            "So I can just say unique and just say OK I want all nodes to be size 500 and click apply OK, it's not very nice.",
            "I can make it kind of a little bit bigger, so quick like 20.",
            "OK now I start to see the shape of the nodes.",
            "Still doesn't really tell me much.",
            "So what I can also use is ranking right?",
            "So this is unique among nodes and I click ranking.",
            "And then what I can choose is an attribute, so all those calculations that we did, all those centrality measures I can pick.",
            "Any of those now?",
            "So I'm going to scale the node size depending on either the degree that between us or the closeness or whatever I like, so I'm going to come.",
            "Let's pick a degree.",
            "The men size and the Max size are the maximum, so the maximum degree that we've seen is 500, and what this will do is it will map a degree size of 500 to 500 pixels.",
            "The minimum degree we see is 1.",
            "It will map nodes with one degree to be 35 pixels and then a linear interpolation between those two values.",
            "You can actually go nonlinear as well.",
            "You can define a spline to say how you want to scale within that.",
            "Access OK so 500 is going to be big so I'm going to make this 200.",
            "This depends on your screen size, a bit, and then I'm going to click apply.",
            "OK, so now I see something.",
            "But it's still pretty messy, but you remember, I run the layout algorithm and there was an option to say prevent overlap, so I'm going to go back and run my.",
            "Algorithm and now I start to see them spreading apart.",
            "It's still not quite what I had in mind, So what I can also do is.",
            "There's a thing called scaling.",
            "So scaling is how much repulsion there is, so if I increase the scaling, it's going to make it more sparse.",
            "So let's try 50.",
            "OK, and then I'm back to where I was.",
            "Did anyone mostly follow everything that I just did?",
            "You need to do it all again.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So.",
            "So what you're going to do is go to nodes right at the top left click on ranking.",
            "Then from this list you pick degree.",
            "OK. Change the min size to be 35.",
            "The maximum size to be 200.",
            "And click apply and that should change the size of your nodes.",
            "But there may still be a big mess.",
            "Everyone's done that.",
            "Yeah, OK, then you go back to your layout algorithm Force Atlas 2.",
            "You want to make sure that you've got these two options selected, dissuade hubs and prevent overlap.",
            "OK, select both of those.",
            "The other thing that I want you to do is increase the scaling the scaling is going to make the graph more spread out, so it's default to two increase that's around 50 and hopefully you click run.",
            "You should end up with a picture like me.",
            "Yeah, they work.",
            "Kind of looks OK. OK, good.",
            "I go by the consensus of 1.",
            "One person said yes, so the rest is, I assume is.",
            "Yeah OK, I see some notes.",
            "So already I can start to see something.",
            "These things are not the same.",
            "So what I will do, I want to really emphasize the big nodes.",
            "I wanted anything that small I want to kind of make very or anything that's less than, say, 100 routes.",
            "I want to make really small and then anything that's really big.",
            "I want to make really big so I can really find the major hubs in the network.",
            "So to do this I can make my spline nonlinear.",
            "So what this will do is it will scale.",
            "The nodes with high degree to be really big in terms of the pixels and anything that's not really big will be quite small in terms of the pixels.",
            "So this will be mapping to 200.",
            "This will be mapping to 35 and 40 and whatever.",
            "So I picked that spline exponential spine.",
            "I can also, you know, really customize this as much as I want.",
            "But I'm just going to leave it like that.",
            "I'm also going to increase my maximum size to 350.",
            "Still not quite what I hoped for.",
            "Let's try 500.",
            "Even more.",
            "OK.",
            "So I was just tweaking the splines, tweaking the numbers until I can really see which other other hubs OK, so now we play a little quiz and then we'll start for awhile for break.",
            "So now it's time for guessing some numbers.",
            "So without cheating, you can't look at your data laboratory.",
            "What airport is this?",
            "Anybody else?",
            "Did you cheat?",
            "It's Frankfurt, Frankfurt is like a European hub, so Heathrow has more passengers, but the number of roots is what we're looking at, so it's not the busiest airport, it's just the maximum of routes.",
            "And the way you can find this out, you can actually.",
            "Again, click on this.",
            "You select this little arrow with a question mark.",
            "And then you click on the node.",
            "It will give you information about the nodes, and here's a label which is FRA which is Frankfurt.",
            "OK.",
            "I can do the same thing with the other.",
            "No, no, it's they go, that's Amsterdam.",
            "And you'll notice already with the layout that Amsterdam and Frankfurt are quite close together.",
            "So something's happening.",
