            "Ernest, when we did the original language wars for those of you remember back to those days her research interests are in intelligent user interfaces, knowledge based, problem solving, collaborative work, particularly working with knowledge and people, which is what she's going to be talking about today.",
            "She led the establishment of the W 3C Provenance activity, which led to the power of ontology being being developed as a standard for provenance in the web.",
            "And she's recently been elected a fellow of the American Society of Artificial Intelligence, which is a significant and prestigious achievement.",
            "And today she's going to tell us about semantic workflows and formulation of workflows, a collaborative activity with scientists.",
            "This is a research area that I particularly work in an account Yolanda, as one of the great inspirations for my work, but also is a great friend, and so I'm absolutely thrilled that she's able to speak to us today, so.",
