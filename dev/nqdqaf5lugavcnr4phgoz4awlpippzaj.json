            "Do I need to use node node node edge weights?",

            "So one thing that troubles me a little bit about models is that if you take a real graph, it probably has probability zero under these models.",
            "For example, the Chronicle graph is completely determined up to isomorphism by 4 numbers, and if I take a real graph, it's not the product, it's not a Chronicle graphs, and if I'm not mistaken, a square has.",

            "You know I can have models even like preferential attachment, right?",
            "That will do terrible job at predicting edges, but at least if I run the whole process for, you know 1 million edges or 1 million nodes at the end, I will at least get something that you know at least has a heavy tailed degree distribution.",
            "At least you know some matches my network, at least at some statistical property or whatever.",
            "The other option is that I could use, for example, what was developed in social Sciences like exponential random graphs that can include alot alot information about the node attributes and things like that.",

            "I think you how to say I yeah I it would probably give you some leverage, but just, you know, using just two by two the same one seems to work quite well.",
            "Just empirically and right?",
            "I mean I went to use, you know, three by three or whatever and it worked better but not so much better.",
            "So I mean I think you could get some leverage.",
            "Depends on what level you want to model your network.",

            "Also sort of what is that we care about?",
            "How little statistics in some sense.",

            "So some interesting properties of graphs, But what would you say is the main takeaway message for the machine learning communities that are represented in this conference?",

            "This picture right that the world is not like that.",
            "It's like that, right?",
            "So you know, if you think about semi supervised learning, you're usually making this assumption right.",
            "You're making an assumption that you know there are these nice clumps that all have the same label.",
            "And then there are these edges where you allow your label to change or whatever, right?",
            "And if you are able, if your network is like that, then yes, this intuition is great.",
            "But if your network is like this right it says here on the yes you'll have this dense clumps, but here in the core it's not clear what you have.",
            "I think that's that's that's for the machine learning community.",
            "The other question is if you go about extracting clusters, how should you go about extracting them right?",
            "Because again, so far when extracting clusters people usually had these types of intuitions, right?",
            "There?",
            "Are these densely connected clumps of nodes?",
            "You know, but if you look at larger networks and basically anyone who worked with large networks.",
            "Or let's put it this way, when I talk to people who are doing, let's say network clustering for for a job they use and you ask them why didn't you show me the results on bigger networks?",
            "They usually say we got bad results and then we didn't know whether our network data is crappy.",
            "This is, you know, if you get some biological network or whether our algorithms are bad, right?",
            "So basically when people work with large networks, they see something is wrong, they just don't know what's wrong with either their data.",
            "They think their data is bad or there, or you know the approximation.",
            "Articles are not good enough or whatever.",
            "What I'm showing here is that.",
            "When you look at bigger data, actually the object gets different.",
            "So yes, the results you are getting are very different, so that's that's one point.",
            "The other point that I glossed over very quickly is this point, right?",
            "Is that it's basically saying that if you want to recover this real groups just based on topology in this intuitions right, you have hope to recover this small groups, but these groups, right?",
            "How will you recover them if they at least in the network they look like as they are randomly scattered sets of nodes?",
            "Alright, so the question is what kind of new intuition?",
            "What kind of external data do you need to be able to extract these things right?",
            "This large Dicks groups?",
            "Because that's the goal of clustering, right?",
            "Isn't it?",
            "To find whatever is real, right?",
            "And this is one you know, sort of.",
            "It's almost like predictive accuracy using cluster clustering or whatever, right?",
            "Is what you what you would do, usually with clustering in in learning.",
