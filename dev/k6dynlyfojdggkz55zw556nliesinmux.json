            "With the since when since an update things have been working much more smoothly, it used to be very slow to get a connection to the network.",
            "Now it's not.",
            "So I think that there are some improvements and as far as I can tell we're happy with it right now, but I also have to say that I'm not following that part of the research project that closely and I would feel better if you got an answer from one of my students who is actually implementing the software.",
