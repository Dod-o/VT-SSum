            "You know summarization and refinement for the conjunctive port.",
            "I didn't really have time to talk about it because that was that slide that didn't have time, but essentially we do that because in the worst case actually you have to do that in the worst case to be complete, you have to test individual.",
            "Did that, we were not able to prune out or to find a definite answer.",
            "You have to test them.",
            "The difference is that we perform this test in the summary, not in the box, and there we do other number refinement as well.",

            "We use that in the infrastructure to automatically match patient records for existing clinical trial and that's something that actually interested in putting in production there.",
            "So your question about.",
            "One last question.",
            "Rather conjunctive queries, can you?",
            "Yes, if address ground the conjunctive tree, can you just give us a hint if you plan to work on non grounded conjunctive queries and what the difficulty is there?",
            "That's a very good question.",
            "I think that.",
            "Is very difficult.",
            "I think you would probably require a completely different approach, because really, the way we manage to do that is by making sure that in the worst case to be complete, we can always test all the candidates right and then we test all the candidate.",
            "And when we do that it's very important to introduce actually right here what you can see here is that even even if the only very imagine that you're.",
            "Conjunctive queries simply rxy where all you want to see is X, right?",
            "So you don't care about the why right?",
            "In our case, actually we're going to add, you know we're going to reduce it in in in something like that where we had a concept to every node in the air bugs.",
            "So what we're doing here is that we already have built in the assumption that we are only testing no data in the box, and I think that's a fundamental difference and.",
            "And it is pretty critical for that, so I think that if we want to get rid of the grounded, you know assumption we need to.",
            "Probably completely rethink our approach, because this is video key aspect.",
            "To get completeness is that we know that we can always get down to that level and test all individual in the box.",
