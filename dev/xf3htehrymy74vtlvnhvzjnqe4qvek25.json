            "That would be for the first hour and a half, then at 10:00 o'clock we will have 1/2 an hour coffee break and then at 10:30 till 12 there will be a sort of a second part of the tutorial where we will go and try to understand sort of go beyond analysis of networks where all we say is that there are no nodes and there are connections.",
