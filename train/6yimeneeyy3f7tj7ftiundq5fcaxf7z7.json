            "What kind of service providers are actually offered to get access to their data.",

            "So in the Netherlands also inside the Clarion project we have been struggling with the authentication at times.",
            "So what we want to do a while ago was set up an instance of Federated content search where you.",
            "Log in with the Clarion authentication and then the authentication will be transferred.",
            "So from the Federated condo search we would access a certain corpus or linguistic resource which is also authenticated and we wanted to transfer the authentication session an so actually I think even on the server side and this was in the end not possible.",
            "We tried both SAML and Oauth and we asked a lot of people in South Korea and Claire in and it turned out as we needed.",
            "Very specific property, I think in some more which was not installed on all identity providers in our countries.",
            "So do you have a recipe for cases like this where you want to transfer an authentication session?",
            "It's about delegated authentication, and if you have only one hop going to just one server then you can as well use all of my deconnect because it will connect with the token and for multiple chains there's no good solution yet available on the market and.",
