            "The plan for today is as follows.",
            "There's one more Ipython notebook I want to show you which relates to the airline network, so we'll go through that, maybe in about half an hour.",
            "Then we'll go and have a small lecture on robustness in networks.",
            "And then we've got a, an Ipython notebook or Jupyter notebook related to robustness.",
            "So we'll try and go through that today.",
            "If we don't manage it completely, then we've got some more time.",
            "Tomorrow.",
            "There is enough time tomorrow to to run over.",
            "I also want today to spend at least half an hour of of our 2 1/2 hour session.",
            "To ask people with the data to come and give a short presentation.",
            "And it doesn't have to be presentation.",
            "Just explain your data set.",
            "And then what?",
            "I hope we we can start to form some teams.",
            "And if you hear someone talking about some data that you think is interesting, then just raise your hand and try and join that, that that team that so that you can have the weekend to work together right so?",
            "If your some people have said to me, you know I don't want to join a team because I'm too busy.",
            "I I.",
            "You know, if you're based in Singapore, you have your job.",
            "That's OK.",
            "I'd still recommend that you join a team, but just be honest with them and say look.",
            "This is what I can contribute and I don't have time to work over the weekend or I do have this time, not this time.",
            "You're going to gain something just by throwing in ideas, and they will gain something by you throwing in ideas.",
            "So don't worry if you don't have the time, but please try and participate as much as you can.",
            "OK so but first I want you to go back to our Jupiter notebooks.",
            "Because we have to fix a mistake that I made.",
            "So some people said it was a bit difficult for them to see.",
            "Stop this yesterday, so tell me if you can't read things on the projector.",
            "So I will zoom in a bit.",
            "Park in the yellow is that can everyone see the fonts at the back?",
            "No, still too small.",
            "Wait till it becomes white and then maybe it's a bit.",
            "Is that better?",
            "I can do it like that.",
            "It's OK to read.",
            "Yeah, OK.",
            "So my instructions that I gave you had a small problem.",
            "One of the libraries that you installed by hand.",
            "If you remember, you have to do this PIP install community.",
            "It's actually not called Community even though you import it as community, it's called something else.",
            "So we just all have to install that library together now and I'll show you how to do that so you don't have to remember.",
            "So, do you have your Jupiter notebook launched?",
            "You went into Anaconda Navigator, launched it?",
            "You know at the web page.",
            "You click knew and then terminal.",
            "It works slightly different for Windows I think, but you probably remember how to do this or you just start the command prompt in Windows.",
            "You get this thing running again.",
            "Terminate.",
            "You couldn't start the terminal.",
            "Are you on windows?",
            "Just just start a command prompt.",
            "It should be OK.",
            "So you know how to do command prompt.",
            "I think on Windows if you want to run a command prompt, you just press Windows Key and R and then type CMD and then you'll get a command prompt.",
            "OK, maybe these guys can help the people if you if you stuck with that quote you just raise your hand and Vivek and Joey and volunteer more.",
            "Or help me.",
            "OK, and then what you have to do.",
            "Is.",
            "You have to install.",
            "Like that?",
            "So you might have to put.",
            "Normally Anaconda will install in your home directory.",
            "So something like this on Linux and Mac, it works like this.",
            "Wherever Anaconda is installed.",
            "You might be able to get away if you haven't installed Python any other way, so if you have not Python underneath and Anaconda run on top.",
            "You can just do Pip install Python.",
            "Like this?",
            "Alright, so but that's the name of the library that you should.",
            "You should install.",
            "If you don't have this library, it's not the end of the world.",
            "It doesn't break everything.",
            "What this?",
            "Popular package does is you import it as community and if you remember in Network X, sorry.",
            "In GFE we did that modularity calculation.",
            "This library provides modularity calculation.",
            "That's what it does, so it will tell you what are the groups and how big are they.",
            "That's it.",
            "Or you guys?",
            "Everything's worked.",
            "OK yeah, OK, you guys in the middle.",
            "That one's OK. OK, it seems to this side of the room it's.",
            "OK. OK, don't I mean if you don't have it installed, don't worry.",
            "There's still just leave it for now.",
            "One of the helpers will come and help you, but what I want you to do now is is open the Ipython notebook #2 which is called network data analysis and Network X. OK, so open this one.",
            "This notebook also includes some text which you can read through it your own your own time.",
            "It gives you some.",
            "Options for finding datasets online.",
            "So if you if you've arrived here and you don't have a data set, you can go to one of these websites and you'll find lists of different networks that have been used in different publications and you might find something that you think is a is interesting.",
            "What I also give you here are the standard file formats for storing networks, so you remember for airline network we used an edge list and it was just a dot CSV file, so it was just in particular format.",
            "There are specific standards designed for networks, one called graffam L1 called GM L1 called Gaffey Org X F1 called GDS, and then you got the edge list or CSV Network X can read in and right.",
            "Any of these file formats?",
            "So if you load in if you want to load in your own data set.",
            "You can get it in one of these formats and then you can write it into something else.",
            "So in this.",
            "This Ipython notebook, this Jupiter notebook, basically what it gives you, is a set of standard ways that the standard procedures in order to load in your own data, do some simple analysis and then also write your own data to a file.",
            "It's also got details of how I got the airline network and how to get it, but you've already got it because you have a CSV file, so it's the same CSV file we're using Jeffy.",
            "Again, we import all the things that we we need.",
            "I might have to make this a little bit smaller because it's.",
            "It's chopping the.",
            "Is that still readable for everyone?",
            "Yeah.",
            "11 tip if you if you lose track of where I am, you can always refer to the box number, the cell number and you can find out where exactly I am in there in the file.",
            "OK, so the code Block number 3.",
            "Basically what it does.",
            "Is it simply loads in reads in the file that contains the CSV?",
            "The airport network, so this is the file name.",
            "These parameters just mean you open it as a reading file and it's binary.",
            "Anne.",
            "Then the thing that's in here.",
            "Limiter so that's the thing that marks subsequent nodes.",
            "Remember, is airport, airport.",
            "Then it says what do you want to create it as?",
            "So it's create using an X dot digraph.",
            "We noted digraph is it's a directional graph, directional network.",
            "If I make this.",
            "Graph it will read in the network as a undirected network undirected graph.",
            "The node type is the data type that I read the node in and at the moment it's just a three letter character, which is a string, so it's reading is a string.",
            "The encoding is just how the file is encoded in UTF 8 format.",
            "This will work most of the time, So what you should be able to do is if you have a file format.",
            "For your own data, which is the same as the airline network, which is a CSV file with Commerce.",
            "The only thing that in principle that you would have to do is change the name here.",
            "So instead of Edge edge list dot CSV you'd call it my data dot CSV.",
            "And that should allow you to read in the network after you run that code.",
            "This variable G, which is usually our graph that will contain the airline network.",
            "Right?",
            "So I just execute this and it's done.",
            "So I now have the airline network in memory.",
            "I can then calculate some statistics, right?",
            "So we've seen these commands before yesterday, so GDOT order that will give you the number of nodes.",
            "Angie dot size.",
            "That will give you the number of edges.",
            "I can workout the average degree just from those two things.",
            "We worked that out yesterday.",
            "Just two times the number of edges divided by N. In the case of an undirected graph.",
            "But because this is directed.",
            "It's just going to be the number of links divided by N. OK, I run this.",
            "And.",
            "Just got to check, but these are the same numbers that we got yesterday, or at least that I got yesterday right?",
            "So the average degree is 12 approximately.",
            "We have 40,000 nearly edges and about 3200 or 3300 airports.",
            "OK, so that's that's all we've done so far.",
            "It's just that small piece of code and those few lines, and we've already got somewhere with our with our network.",
            "So with your own data set, part of the problem might be getting it into the right format.",
            "For as we've got for the airlines, but once you've done that, this is all you need to do.",
            "OK then.",
            "We can calculate the indegree and outdegree of every node, so the way that you do this.",
            "Is you say, well, Gee dot in degree.",
            "This will give you a dictionary like a list of all the airports and their associated in degrees and out degrees.",
            "Right and then I this is how I then refer to it so in degrees is is like a list, but it's something called the dictionary.",
            "And I want to say, OK, give me in degrees of this airport, JFK.",
            "Right?",
            "In our.",
            "File every airport has a quotation around it, right?",
            "So I have to include that as part of the the key when I'm looking these things up so when I access this variable what it's going to give me is the indegree of JFK.",
            "Right?",
            "So in degree is a number of routes arriving at JFK out degree is the number of routes arriving at.",
            "The number of routes departing from JFK, I can name these variables everything, write anything I want.",
            "So if I call this.",
            "Oh degree and I'd agree.",
            "I just have to make sure that I change the way I access them.",
            "Here, right, so I pick the names of the variables but pick names of variables that make sense.",
            "It will make your life easier later on, right?",
            "If you.",
            "Because in the in the original file.",
            "What it reads in there.",
            "There are quotes around each airport, so it's reading the whole thing as a string, so it doesn't read just JFK.",
            "Is reading, JFK, Yeah, the original story.",
            "You could preprocess it and throw those things away.",
            "That's another problem.",
            "But the computer reads these things literally right, so it doesn't know that you mean something different.",
            "I was just too lazy to process file.",
            "It came like that so.",
            "OK, so if I do this it will work to a point.",
            "Right, but then I'm going to get an error because I'm still trying to access these variables in degrees and out degrees.",
            "So I'll just try that.",
            "It works for a reason.",
            "Why did it work?",
            "It's still both because I'd executed this just a few minutes before we started, so it has both variables in there now.",
            "So that's why.",
            "But if I restart and clear all the output, let's do that.",
            "OK so I have to go from the top again so I'll show you that trick so if I go in the cell and I say cell.",
            "Run all above that will so I don't have to go through 1 by 1.",
            "OK, just to make sure that this is ready.",
            "Play.",
            "Now it's done.",
            "So now I should get the error.",
            "OK, so I do so.",
            "It's important that because you will make mistakes and you will get things wrong, it's important that you learn to read how to interpret the error messages.",
            "So it just says there's a name error name in degrees is not defined, so I'm trying to access a variable that it doesn't exist.",
            "So if you see that just look through and make sure you've got all the you not made a typo or something like this, it will happen.",
            "And it will happen to me again so.",
            "I put this back.",
            "OK, so that's no Yep.",
            "What if I want to get the old notes of all nodes?",
            "You can do that, you just have to do a for loop.",
            "So you have to iterate over through every node.",
            "And then get the node name and then do the same kind of access.",
            "Maybe I'll show you how to do that in a in a while.",
            "I might have an example of it.",
            "You can loop over the whole all the nodes in the network quite easily.",
            "OK, so.",
            "That's just showing you how you access the degrees.",
            "Now this code looks pretty complicated, but it's.",
            "It's.",
            "All it's doing is doing a plot.",
            "So there are easier ways to generate these plots, but there are options directly in Python.",
            "That will do this, so I'm not going to go through and explain how this all works, but you can refer to the manual.",
            "And what I should also tell you is.",
            "So.",
            "Just after the first cell.",
            "You'll see in this text as a link.",
            "And that link will directly take you to the Network X library online.",
            "After a redirection, so not directly.",
            "But this is what it looks like, so if you want to understand any of the commands that I've used anywhere in the code, you can go in here and search for it and find it and it will tell you what are the arguments.",
            "What does it give back and and so on.",
            "So let's take an example.",
            "So say I want to understand what order does.",
            "I go to the documentation and look for order.",
            "OK.",
            "So you'll see this order on a multi diagraph order on a digraph order on a graph.",
            "I'm just using a normal graph.",
            "I'm using a diagraph here, so I click this.",
            "And it will tell me with this kind of pretty simple English.",
            "OK, well, this is a.",
            "The function order which will return the number of nodes in the graph.",
            "And it tells you the type of thing that you're going to get back.",
            "In this case is an integer.",
            "So when you get stuck, this is going to be the way that you find out.",
            "Well, you can either ask me one of the other guys or you can try and learn these things yourself.",
            "Again, it's this idea of learning to fish, right?",
            "So I just give you the way to fix your mistakes and also find out why you've got your mistakes.",
            "OK, what this whole thing does is plots the graphs.",
            "So I can get the indegree and just as a normal plot I can then do this on a log log scale.",
            "So we see that this is almost a straight line, so we know what that means now, right?",
            "It's a it's a power law.",
            "What I do include as well, and you install this library.",
            "It's called power law.",
            "I think it was Stephen told you again and again.",
            "Don't assume it's a power law.",
            "It might be a lognormal.",
            "There is a library called Power Law in Python which hasn't actually and accompany accompanying scientific publication which will describe the library and what it will do is allow you to try fits of different functions to your data.",
            "So is it more like a log normal?",
            "Is it more like a power law and so on.",
            "So I give you an example of how to.",
            "Check these fits.",
            "So I do in degree some results for me.",
            "The fit here I get the out degree and this is the also the out degree on a log log plot.",
            "So again they seem to be.",
            "Following a parallel.",
            "OK, then what I've added here.",
            "Is an algorithm that I've written to actually calculate all the path lengths so I will go through this step by step, but then I will start to go things a bit faster 'cause I don't want to spend.",
            "The whole afternoon just telling you exactly how my code works.",
            "OK, so the first thing here.",
            "This is just a trick because this is an expensive computation.",
            "I don't want if I've already calculated it, I just don't want to calculate it again.",
            "So I just say if there's a variable called average path length inside the inside the set of all global variables.",
            "Don't do this.",
            "Only do this if the variable doesn't exist already.",
            "So I then have two local variables, Max path length and total 0.0.",
            "They will be explained in awhile.",
            "Then somebody asked how you iterate over all the nodes.",
            "So I just say 4 N in G. So inside this indented.",
            "Part of the code here.",
            "It will loop over every node.",
            "So I'm going to go to every node N. One by one and execute this piece of code.",
            "But that's the that's the way you iterate over all the nodes.",
            "Then I say the path length.",
            "Another variable is equal to NX, which is a network X library.",
            "Single source, shortest path length G. Anne.",
            "I give a comment here is but we can also.",
            "Take this if I don't understand what it is, copy it.",
            "Put it inside here, paste.",
            "Compute the shortest path links from source to all reachable nodes.",
            "So you see, there's three parameters, or one of them is optional, which I don't include in my code.",
            "First thing is the graph.",
            "The second thing is a source node.",
            "So what it's going to do from that source node is calculate the shortest path to every single other node in the network.",
            "Right?",
            "And then I get to it says it gives me a dictionary back, I think.",
            "So it gives me a dictionary and that will be the shortest path.",
            "Links to all the nodes.",
            "So it will look if you look at it.",
            "It will look like this.",
            "Again, is the number of nodes to close in the network and each one of those.",
            "Will have a value and this will be the path length, so this might be 10.",
            "This might be 5.",
            "Might be 3 four.",
            "20 So from my source node.",
            "Which we say is N. This is the path length 112 and three and so on, but that's what it does.",
            "So that makes my life pretty easy because I don't have to do that myself for every single node.",
            "Then I'm going to say total and then plus equals is just like writing.",
            "If I do X + = 1, That's the same as writing X is equal to X + 1.",
            "OK so total I add this.",
            "To the total sum is going to take this whole set.",
            "And sum up all the values in that set.",
            "So that's all the total path length or total distance from node ends.",
            "All the other nodes in the network.",
            "What have I just done?",
            "What is that?",
            "What's the same thing that I calculate there so if I sum up from N, the distance to all the other nodes?",
            "And then divide that by.",
            "N -- 1.",
            "I get the the closeness centrality right.",
            "It's telling me, on average, how far are all the other nodes from me to the rest of the network?",
            "Then I do something where I keep track of the longest shortest path so I can measure the diameter, right?",
            "So remember, this is just for one node, NI will loop again and do the same thing for another node.",
            "When I'm looking for the diameter, I'm looking for the longest shortest path, so I just keep track of the longest shortest path that I see and that will give me the diameter of the network.",
            "OK. And that's it.",
            "So and then, the average path link is is just calculated like this.",
            "I did this on purpose by hand, just to give you a feeling of how to calculate these things.",
            "There is something that will do this for you.",
            "So if you want to calculate average path length, there is a function inside.",
            "Network access will do that, so you don't have to go to this, but it's just to give you a feeling of how these things are calculated.",
            "Can you remember what the average path length was for the airport layer lines?",
            "1224 yeah OK.",

            "Because it's quite an expensive operation, right?",
            "It's it's going from every node to every other node to calculate these these paths, I have the fastest MacBook money can buy, but it still takes time.",

            "This is how you calculate between the centrality of all the nodes, the closest centrality and.",
            "The other cuts that type centrality.",
            "Then I print the average.",
            "I can then say give me the top 10 airports sorted by between us.",
            "So these are basically doing exactly the same things that we were doing in gafi.",
            "The difference here is I can add a new airport if I want, or I can remove an airport very easily and I can do that in a systematic way.",
            "So if I want to really take network by network, sorry, airport by airport if I want to remove one by one and measure some property of the system, I could do that in Gaffey, but I have to do it by hand.",
            "I have to click and then delete the node, click and delete the nodes.",
            "Let's say you wanted 100 times.",

            "So again, these things cost quite a lot of time, because between essentiality I have to.",
            "What do I have to calculate?",
            "Yeah, so I have to calculate all the shortest paths again.",
            "Right, that's why I put these things in the global variables.",
            "I've already done this one, so it's a bit stupid, but I'll do it again.",
            "But you don't want to do this computation again and again and again as the network scales.",
            "That thing gets worse and worse and worse, right?",
            "'cause it's an N squared problem.",
            "So for every node I have to do for other all the other end minus one notes.",
            "There are tricks to make it faster, but it's still expensive.",
            "So if you've got a really, really old machine, you might find that this takes you.",
            "All day there's another tip is if you find someone make sure they've got a reasonable machine as well, otherwise.",
            "So maybe I'll leave that running for a little bit longer.",
            "Um?",
            "So here we go.",
            "So I print out the top 10 and we see that you remember yesterday we saw that same top 10 for the between the centrality with Frankfurt's number one Anchorage is number 2, and then do buyers #3 and and so on.",
            "I can then also plot the distribution of between the centrality.",
            "So again, like the degree distribution, I put the between US centrality distribution.",
            "And also closeness and the eigenvector centrality.",
            "So the eigenvector I will explain it briefly, but we won't see how to calculate it.",
            "And the eigenvector is a bit like Google's Pagerank algorithm.",
            "So.",
            "The way Google ranks web pages in terms of importance and why they became rich is basically the eigenvector algorithm centrality algorithm.",
            "What they do is they say a page is important if it's linked to by other important pages.",
            "So I can be important by having lots of unimportant pages refer to me or by just a few very important pages.",
            "Also referring to me.",
            "It's a recursive definition, right?",
            "So I have to figure out how that works, but there are algorithms to calculate this and you just keep iterating on this algorithm until you find a stable system where you get a measure of.",
            "Eigenvector centrality, so the nodes that have higher eigenvector centrality will be pointed to or linked to nodes with high eigenvector centrality.",
