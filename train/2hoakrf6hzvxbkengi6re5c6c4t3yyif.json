            "It is a huge, active community that makes this happen, and without it we would not be where we are today.",
            "So I begin by acknowledging that it has been the honor of my professional career to be a member of this global, worldwide ovr community.",
            "From my earliest days in the earliest days is a program officer at the Hewlett Foundation, but particularly being the grant manager for MIT Open Courseware to now designing and participating in the first of designing and participating in the first UNESCO meeting in 2002 and today to participating in this world O ER Congress with my colleagues from across the globe.",
            "And it's also my privilege to spend my days working on this very Noble innovation, which is focused on key.",
            "Two key dimensions that we've heard all about witches were first equalizing access to knowledge for people across the globe, but Secondly, an equally importantly is improving teaching and learning, and we're really at an inflection point in education.",
            "In particularly, I think with respect to ER, where we focus much more on the teaching and learning aspects that the ovr enables.",
            "I thank the Commonwealth of Learning and UNESCO for their dedication in their leadership in the development of this field over the past 15 years.",
            "And the government obviously of Slovenia for their incredible leadership in organizing this major event.",
            "This three way partnership paves the path forward for all of us to work together to work across bridges and to build communities where we can extend and build on our knowledge.",
            "And I do really want to stop and recognize the countless we are leaders in the Champions who are not in this room today who stand behind the organizations that we represent who worked tirelessly in support of O ER in their communities and in their classrooms.",
            "They include administrators, content developers and policy makers.",

            "S Tameka referred to and supporting MIT's then groundbreaking Knowledge Sharing Initiative, MIT Open courseware for the first time ever.",
            "A University was willing to open the window beyond their ivygate to share with others across the globe.",
            "And while we at the foundation were excited about this groundbreaking project, we were also concerned that others, particularly in places with this type of academic content, was most difficult to access.",
            "Would also find it useful for teaching and learning.",
            "We didn't want to build it and see if they would come.",
            "We wanted to build it and design it to make sure we included their voices at the table so we did reach out to UNESCO to the leadership and ask if a meeting could be convened.",
            "And certainly the time was right with the synergies of all the organizations working together.",
            "And while the first courses for MIT were still under development, we asked a few critical questions.",
            "Was there a thirst for the MIT academic content?",
            "Secondly, would it be useful for teaching and learning purposes?",
            "And at this UNESCO lead meeting we heard three clear messages from meeting participants.",
            "First, there was indeed an incredible thirst for this content.",
            "Second, participants were very clear that they wanted to actively participate in this two way global knowledge exchange or multi way I should say, global knowledge exchange.",
            "It should not be solely content from the North.",
            "Developed for the Global, South and 3rd, there were many other areas of academic content that would be highly useful for different pocket pockets around the world and nursing medicine, business and other academic domains.",
            "And at this convening, there was a surprise spurious effect that can happen.",
            "As you know, in these meetings that involve open NIS were in the afternoon, we had designed small breakout sessions and we had assigned each small group with a set of pre specified questions.",
            "But there was one breakout group.",
            "Now they didn't like their questions.",
            "Now they thought they were irrelevant and so they really needed that.",
            "They thought to address the idea that we needed a name for this for this movement for this new nascent.",
            "Idea and from the small group of about a dozen global participants.",
            "The name was coined open educational resources.",
            "And so from this feedback of the meeting in 2002, the Hewlett Foundation was energized to fund O ER initiatives across the globe and included initiatives through the Commonwealth of Learning, UNESCO, the Open Education Consortium, the teacher education in Sub.",
            "Sahara Africa, Creative Commons and they are far reaching network and the open universities as well.",
            "Last year I was reflecting as I was thinking about preparing these remarks about the Hewlett Foundation, which last year celebrated its 50th year and forward celebration.",
            "It commissioned a report by the Bridge Span Group in Total Dulit Foundation and the pursuit of Impact, and from this five decade reflection of all the things that you Let Foundation has invested in.",
            "Ovr was called out of as one of four highlighted.",
            "Areas of investment both for its innovation and for his tremendous global impact, and the report noted the development of the field.",
            "We are field exemplified a core human Hewlett Foundation value of leadership in collaboration and that these two values that sit side-by-side can create attention as well as a very productive valant balance.",
            "And I called this out now because I think it's a lesson learned.",
            "During the first 15 year development of the field and I extends, I believe for the next decade's leadership.",
            "Through collaborative, inspiration and collaboration.",
            "Through extending support and building bridges of partnership.",
            "When the field launched, there was no clear blueprint for development.",
            "It was unknown what form the ovr movement would take.",
            "It was unknown what strategies would work best.",
            "Ullett Foundation learned along the way.",
            "We shared what we learned and others in the Community shared back with us.",
            "We all tried to cultivate a community that sought to create a multiplier effect from resources that we put into the field.",
            "And I think these values of leadership and collaboration, which we've actually heard echoed throughout the day, remain core to the community.",
            "I also want to note that Creative Commons has played a key role throughout the development of this field.",
            "The organization developed in tandem with the OE, our field and its licensing structure.",
            "My personal relationship with Creative Commons has been through the lens.",
            "Again of being a EULA program officer supporting the earliest days of its organization.",
            "From its development in 2002, I later became a board member and then CEO and President from 2001 to 2014, and it was during this.",
            "That the CC International, the Creative Commons International License, and the Aigio licenses were developed and launched.",
            "CC Creative Commons, like the movement, went through an evolution at one time having up to 12 licenses, including a developing nations license and its original licenses required legal scholars to port.",
            "The license is into the lore of their local jurisdiction.",
            "This Rep.",
            "This process was replicated in over 40 jurisdictions around the world by young.",
            "Typically, young legal scholars who were interested in the idea of sharing an innovation.",
            "But it was really too complicated and the whole process needed to be simplified.",
            "And international government organizations began to call for a license that would address their reluctance to resolve disputes in national courts, as they tend to include alternative just dispute resolution mechanisms in most of their contracts and licenses.",
            "So the work on the igo in the international licenses began in 2011 and we worked with RCC affiliates across the globe and it took over two years and was finalized in late 2013.",
            "These licenses, particularly IGO license, address the needs of Wypo, UNESCO, the World Bank, IE CD and other similar organizations.",
            "So as we look to the future, an all that we've learned."

        [
            "I put together a few action steps for greatest impact and again I call out that these have really been called out throughout the day in different ways.",
            "And here I try to make them explicit.",
            "The first one is really supporting the rich cultural and language diversity and O ER while we heard that initial need additional, the initial meeting, the content really needed to be multi pronged multidirectional.",
            "We do have too much content from just certain language domains.",
            "And really, the power of Ovr is that we can collect this rich language and cultural diversity.",
            "This was understood from the very inception of the movement and we have yet to really realize this impact.",
            "We need to have content in a variety of mother tongues and particularly this can be used with respect to literacy, the issues of literacy, and having a book in every child's hand.",
            "We can do this at much greater efficiency than we have been able to do historically, and as I mentioned, the content is to English dominant.",
            "The second action step really involves promoting research on how and what context we are, improve teaching and learning.",
            "So it was great to hear Asha just called this out as well.",
            "In her presentation this afternoon.",
            "There is research, but it is thin and the research is not in many local contextual domains, and it is also not tide closely to practice.",
            "So Oers point, an opportunity now is to change.",
            "Teaching and learning practice.",
            "So we have content we don't have content everywhere, but we also need to understand what is the efficacy of O ER in these new pedagogical practices and this really couldn't come at a better time, because certainly it's been noted the world has changed, technology is changed and we cannot continue to teach in the ways we have historically.",
            "Students need to be producers as well as consumers.",
            "We all need to Co construct our learning.",
            "Teachers need to own their own agency around learning as well as students need to own their own agency.",
            "If we teach a child, have agency around learning, we have solved the problem for their lifelong learning because they will go on again and again and again and use the resources available then to them too.",
            "Figure out the next steps in their learning journey and ago.",
            "As I say that in context that they need access to the tools to be able to do that, but we do need to teach every individual to have this agency of curiosity and energy around what is meaningful to them and their learning structure.",
            "So the last point on the research pieces, we now have a very open nature of learning and not only will we have openly licensed materials, but we can have open data and open research and this cycle can create very rapid cycles for improvement.",
            "So this is what I've always called the Holy Grail of open educational resources that we have content we use curriculum in contexts we understand and research what happens.",
            "In student learning, in what contexts we take that data, we share that data broadly with a larger ecosystem, and we analyze that data and continue to use that to improve in very rapid cycles.",
            "This is something that heretofore has not been possible, because curriculum that is locked down that can't be readily adapted.",
            "It takes long cycles to improve it, and so here we can use the expertise of teachers.",
            "We can use the expertise of researchers and designers to Co create this new system.",
            "And my last action step is that government support, if we must also be increased and as private philanthropy cannot be expected to be the prime supporter in the long run.",
            "And I know many governments have already stepped forward.",
            "But more and more governments will need to step forward.",
            "And I'm not indicating these are governments that have do not have any capacity to do this.",
            "These are governments that are already investing in education that need to set aside a portion of their educational budgets for open educational resources.",
            "Because it makes sense as a multiplier effect, because you don't need to continue to buy the same materials again and again.",
            "We know from research, so this is what we know.",
            "We know that there is economic efficiency and that students learn just as well with open textbooks and open materials as those from proprietary.",
            "So while we have traditional models and yes, there are business models to be figured out, there is a new world in which publishers need to operate and ultimately governments.",
            "Are about educating and supporting their citizens.",
            "It is a primary responsibility of governments and so government funds will need to be used to support the ovr movement in the long run.",
            "This doesn't mean philanthropy won't go away or will help support innovations and activities, but ultimately the philanthropy was really used to spur the early days to begin to get us to this point and time.",
            "And so I do really want to encourage governments to think very hard about how their education dollars are used, because ultimately.",
            "It's a learning of students.",
            "At every level that is the primary reason and responsibility of everyone who's in this room, and if we think about that.",
            "And the best way to create efficiency and effectiveness, we know beyond a shadow of a doubt, that open educational resources create that mechanism.",
            "We do have to continue to improve quality.",
            "There are incredible quality resources out there.",
            "We should not let anyone else tell us that they don't exist.",
            "We are now coming out with research with least within the United States that demonstrates this.",
            "Significantly and so I do want to just call that out while quality continues to be an issue, it is not a stumbling block.",
            "We've never really looked at the quality of the proprietary curriculum, so this is another issue that you know is just historic.",
            "So what we need to do is continue to move ahead in this movement.",
            "I want to know that the world in which we are was born has changed dramatically in 2002 we did, there were very few smartphones, if any.",
            "They were only in the hands of a select few and they weren't as pervasive as today WhatsApp.",
            "We chat, Skype, Facebook, they didn't exist then.",
            "The world has changed in many significant ways, and now I would say the importance of open education is more important than ever.",
            "So we have the opportunity to create this teacher and student in learning agency and we have this ability to distribute knowledge, anytime, anyplace, and any pace.",
            "The pace is also a critical ingredient for the future.",
            "We also have AI that will be overlaid over the teaching and learning materials, and we know students do not learn at the same pace we're having a conversation at lunch today and I was saying in my teaching experience I had 45 students in my classroom.",
            "And the 45 students had incredible range of where they were with respect to the material.",
            "There was no way I as an individual teacher, could teach to that, but with the materials and the technology in the future that we're collectively building, we can address that challenge.",
            "So I would say looking back to 2002 in our wildest dreams we would collectively be amazed at where we are today.",
            "The spread the take up has been tremendous and now the work has to go far deeper, deeper into the practices of O ER deeper into the efficacy of O ER to explore this inflection point and to really build strong pedagogical affectedness which will just drive towards deeper.",
            "Equity and inclusion.",
            "There's no corner of the world should be neglected, and all corners should be contributed and engage in the OR movement.",
            "So let me close with the Slovenian tagline that I learned today around.",
            "Oh yeah, that I really like your endless body.",
            "That ovr is your endless body.",
            "Well, now I can't even read it your endless body.",

            "We are the endless, but I hadn't ever seen that Slovenia quote.",
            "I think it's great and I think the movement needs milk and need to continue to evolve.",
