            "The current structure of supply network, Shannon A as I said, it's generally it's a grouping of 25 companies in the region and it has a steering committee which is made up of participants from those companies and when they meet monthly their domain tasks currently are things like marketing where they spend a lot of their efforts in trying to jointly market the network.",
            "They look a branding and imaging network, events, seminars, plantours things like that.",
            "They come together for joint exhibitions, trade shows.",
            "And joint advertising and Direct direct mailing.",
            "So that's that's one of the main activities is the marketing of the network as a as a group of company equipment companies wanna number of core competencies?",
            "The second thing that the second major past there the operation is in a joint training activities.",
            "Very well defined, it's more beneficial to come together to do joint training in the companies even though they may be operating in different sectors, they still have training needs which are which are quite similar, so they find it useful to come together for that.",
            "Is somewhat more a related into the actual end to equally Tanti plus P and so on.",
            "Is there is the supply chain where in the past they have looked at trying to develop some sort of a some sort of philosophy or methodology which is similar to equal in which the term tsunami at the time this is going back a few years and where they were trying to get clusters of complementary companies to share.",
            "Resource is now they were primarily focusing their effort at the time on the production planning system and we're trying to coordinate the production planning, but they just found it.",
            "It was quite difficult and they just left it because of resource issues and so on, so that's why they equally fits nicely back into that Internet activity.",
            "And just to briefly mention just a couple of clustering, and I suppose initiatives that have been have been part of our supply network.",
            "Shannon and this just mentioned a few sort of being a successful and some have failed for various different reasons.",
            "So again, we hope that the equally results can help to make these little piece more successful in the future.",
            "So there's just a number of different data horizontally.",
            "Cluster layer which was in the Precision engineering framework and it failed due to basically competing activities within the organization they were they were trying to get closer together in the first place.",
            "And then there's a number of very good clusters which eventually lead us back down to the tsunami type effect where they're trying to get their disappointment.",
            "With Shannon copies.",
            "All are working on from the same plane from the same platform using this planet with Shannon as the main introduction of business to the to the network itself and feeding data through the companies.",
            "Made month one comment on the last slide.",
            "The vertical cluster in electronic manufacturing.",
            "We're talking about videos of three partners very informal at the moment.",
            "Yeah, and not so many.",
            "Yeah, yeah, what we're talking about is when I'm talking with the larger maybe videos in their structures that are in place currently within the network hour and people meet at meetings and they have some business.",
            "And then they put it to someone else.",
            "23 Maybe four partners together so they they come together in very very small in small instances.",
            "And as you said that they're quite informal in the way that they are structured, the way that they managed.",
            "The way that the contracts roll on and so on, so again, I'm hoping with the video or video management to try and bring in another piece more structure Internet to try and develop some of the ideas.",
            "Take some of the ideas and introduce them to the to these actual air networks.",
            "And this is just just quickly where we feel that equally footfalls in again as you're familiar with this.",
            "Whereas it's in the formation of the virtual organization, should there and should actually be feeding into the video development, and then also the management of the fee or afterwards.",
            "And of course, I suppose one key thing that we brought it up in the meeting area is that we also feel that there's a need to have some sort of a methodology for managing and the interaction of non network companies with these type of a networks, because not all the time you can have all the competencies that you require within the network itself, so that's something that if we were we would require.",
            "And just again, this is touching back on the points that have been brought up.",
            "An is that we feel this for display network Shannon to be successful in carrying our field management.",
            "There's also we need to link back to the BBB because we feel that the baby is a very very key step in developing structured videos.",
            "'cause as I said, a minute we've got very very informal and structures in the videos.",
            "So to put in an monitoring techniques and so on.",
            "So that is quite difficult because there because because of so informal.",
            "For that size was that's been covered, that's been covered already in relation to our requirements in relation to the video management, or we are the key areas that we feel are key are in maybe not so much the formation which again falls back into the baby.",
            "But this solution and others.",
            "In relation to what happens when it comes to the end of this contract?",
            "If you need to, if you need to carry on you, bring in your partners or do you just design, but at the end of the contract the costing of the actual name of the of the system as it's going through and the monitoring of the costing of the system.",
            "But it needs to be transparent if the network is to work a incorrect fashion.",
            "The contract ING what we do contract partners into the network and they can be coming from the goal can believe gonna change them which feeds into the negotiation and the renegotiation.",
            "So if someone leaves the network or someone's not performing the way they should.",
            "If a contract negotiations can can be carried out, can you take in someone you you have to go back up and dissolve the network and create a new network?",
            "A conflict resolution is another one in which we feel is key is the source conflict between the powerful themselves.",
            "Have you got some sort of mechanism in place in order to identify those conflicts early on and to try and resolve this ticket if possible?",
            "And the monitoring and reporting.",
            "Then it is basically on the performance of the network itself.",
            "What actual performance metrics should be used?",
            "If what should be monitored and reported on, and who should get those reports which which feeds back down to our tour.",
            "Last point, if we just go to the last point is is that we expect that the network will have internal and external company members because a lot of the companies within our network actually deal with external people.",
            "They deal with Chinese suppliers for certain things.",
            "Or maybe maybe in a lower class economies.",
            "Which they may not want to give them all the information, but they still want to analyze them through their through the mechanisms of equal leader and the second one is the customer liaisons as part of the VM who actually deals with the customer is it?",
            "Is it the network on the top level?",
            "Does it cost more than feed that back into the into?",
            "The companies?",
            "Have a company brings in the business who actually who directly deals with with the actual lamb the customers themselves.",
            "In relation to a planned demonstrations that we have in the Bomp area.",
            "In the first one is to take that those videos that we talked about in the previous slides and first of all to look at them.",
            "Monitoring focus on collaboration performance.",
            "So again through the meeting we identified a number of areas where these actually fall into place and so just the SSID and adopt the triple.",
            "Yeah, I think it's pronounced.",
            "So, and as part of that, we want to identify a conflict between parents are trying to identify that as the actual system is moving around.",
            "The second one is to fulfill the reporting requirements of the customer should determine that a lot of their companies that they they are completed, error networks would deal with and require a lot of reporting to the system.",
            "So if we could get some sort if we get the video and video management tool to actually develop some of these reports and so on, it would save.",
            "The company is developing, developing, developing these individually, so we believe that's true that they may have first monitoring the finance.",
            "I think section of the tool.",
            "In addition to the conflict Resolution A, we're hoping to support support.",
            "Actually their decision support systems that we actually identify the contracts and evaluate them in relation to customer liaison there to be integrated using the inheritance counts concepts which I believe or not yet developed, for sure, we're hoping you know when they come on board to actually bring them, bring them into the system and relation to the main challenges to doing all this.",
            "We feel that the forces how to incorporate a report 2 from BB external partners, so that goes back to what I said.",
            "We expect it to be known fix down partners as part of our networks and how do we take information from these partners and send information back from Watts or levels of information can get supplied.",
            "What is a different log ONS and so on?",
            "And the last one is the general resolution of long of conflicts not covered by the this decision support system, in that it may not give resolutions that conflict.",
            "So it is something that we would like to see as part of the system as well.",
            "OK. More about the.",
            "Genetic as.",
            "Sorry, we have this line.",
            "Customer liaison is to be dated using the inheritance concepts.",
            "Yeah, and I'm not sure what exactly is involved in the inheritance concepts.",
            "That was true then with the talking with the US was with you guys in this and what we would like is that we need to have their customer liaison toward the customers at the management is if you ever actually because the ends it's the end company deals with what the customer but it was changed into use some sort of video management tool.",
            "We believe at a higher level that it needs to have some sort of it liaises directly then with.",
            "With the customer, in order to deal with them directly as opposed to individual company and ended the individual companies sending that information and through the system, I'm not sure what were the inheritance in module works are diminished and maybe if you maybe we could talk more or less.",
            "Yeah we came to the discussion.",
            "For example, what happens if there's a warranty case?",
            "Who takes care of this and all this stuff is not defined?",
            "Yet and should be done in the inheritance management, who?",
            "Who will be the partner of the customer after Savioli?",
            "Split up.",
            "Yes, some more questions and comments."
