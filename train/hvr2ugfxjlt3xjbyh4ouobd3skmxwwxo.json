            "So you could think of some people being discounting the future more.",
            "Other people discounting the future less as just differences in what they want, but they could be completely rational and consistent about pursuing different things, or whether some people are somehow failing to achieve what they really want, and I think.",

            "So I can tell you anything about learning under ambiguity in these studies, but there is some indication of neural encoding of the level of ambiguity or attitudes towards ambiguity.",
