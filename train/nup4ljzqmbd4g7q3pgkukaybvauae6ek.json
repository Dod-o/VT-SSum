            "Now what I want to say is that basically you have all these behaviors on different sites and what most people do is usually analyze the behavior on just one site.",

            "So you have to be able to re encode things in multiple ways to be able to save them in your memory, so that's it's the same reason why when you change your computer or if you stand when typing or when you go to a new place, you have difficulty remembering your passports so."

And basically, if I have a set of prior user names of someone and I have an you username, can I tell if they belong to the same person, so U is the candidate username like John Smith and see is the Canada username and use the prior user names, J Smith or John S&F?",
