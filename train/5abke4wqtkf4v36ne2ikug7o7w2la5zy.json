            "You were going on the Internet and looking at things and being interested.",

            "I'm not sure if it was designed or if it was just a side effect, but the process of going through and looking at what I was saving, like revisiting the sort of trajectory of things that I was looking at on the Internet has this sort of.",

            "So when delicious Godbaby Yahoo we sort of started.",

            "So you get this sort of moment where you're like.",
            "Oh, like I can sort of see your perspective or why you would be why you would look at this thing in this way.",
            "Absolutely, and is really rapidly growing community.",
            "For that reason I think.",
            "Ethel just said will just go like down the line.",
            "I will open it up, but what I find is particularly interesting about also what you just mentioned, but also understanding the Arky Futures platform is there is such a direct attempt to somehow blend or merge or engage with the realm of print publications and the digital world of publications that were really innovative way.",
            "I wonder whether you could explain how that develops.",
            "Could very briefly, and also again, just to reiterate it, maybe expand upon why you also, maybe it's very simple answer why you are engaging with Instagram and Facebook to to sort of sent to.",
            "With this I mean, maybe it's just delivering a message, but I'm just interested to know.",
            "Well, the first I will be very brief because technical issues can get can be bored or not.",
            "But yes we have always, you know we are printers but we are also passionate readers both sister and myself.",

            "A.",

            "We are aware that we have until now four wonderful books, but not all the text interest in the same.",

            "That you might not normally find.",
            "So with this platform, how have you sort of dealt with that issue of kind of allowing people to self cure rate?",
            "How do you feel about self curation?",
            "Does it actually limiting or do you think it's expands the possibilities for us and this is a very very personal.",

            "We think that one of the problems with knowledge exchange and also Academy and all of these topics nowadays that the tendency is to close and close and close more your knowledge.",
            "So we see this as a tool.",
            "For example, if you are teaching a class or whatever topic you can select your six articles that talk about that and print the syllables to the students and make it open so it's one of the motivations to really a really create a departing from future architecture, platform and all these wonderful constellation of thinkers that we have to create an open knowledge.",
            "So how it scales is going to be fascinating and for some reason you see we're testing.",

            "He talks about how Facebook and Twitter right at the further very beginning of these platforms.",
            "They had very long considered arguments about whether or not they should allow advertising onto the platforms, and they all decided emphatically not to allow it.",
            "And to see how the kind of power of scalability and capitalism and requirement funding other Twitters never made a profit sort of subverted these kind of very idealistic and very genuine and authentic decisions is kind of scary.",
            "So I also wonder maybe this is something you can pick up on Ethel, you know, Utopia is a utopia.",
            "You know part of the definition of Utopia is that they never realized, and so I wonder if you do agree that there is a kind of 2nd wave happening.",

            "Yeah yeah I completely agree.",

            "Yeah, I think you're right, but again, you just keep reminding me of interesting things I've read writing this lecture.",
            "One of the other things I read was that this was in Youngchul hands book, The Burnout Society.",
            "He said one other kind of best qualities, or the most impressive qualities human kind have is to ignore things, right is to ignore things and really not necessarily realize what kind of situation there in until it's too late.",

            "Kind of what Arena is a platform is trying to sell, expand and all that kind of thing, so I wonder this is open to anybody.",
            "And also I just want to open it up as well to the audience as well.",
            "I mean, I think we probably got time for like 2 questions is if you have something just put your hand up, but whether you think that the like, ultimately we are sort of destined in some way to fall into another trap.",
            "And it's like maybe you can speculate what that trap might be as you perceive it as a kind of person operating in this field, like at the frontline.",
            "Yeah, I think a lot.",

            "You know Facebook and Twitter started with these ideals that were not based around advertising, but they were still there was still sort of a fatal flaw in both of them from the beginning, which is that for Facebook, the whole the whole action is creating a profile for yourself.",
            "So the method of communicating with other people is about how it is a reflection of you.",
            "So your action on Facebook is like this is me.",
