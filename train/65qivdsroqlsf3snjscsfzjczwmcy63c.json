        [
            "Now, given this high level idea, what are the difficulties?",
            "So to get this posterior of Alpha and Z you need the notion of a prior right and we choose to use an IID gamma prior for our work, where you know P Alpha just factorizes into the products of the individual Alpha UVS, and each of them are individually drawn from a gamma.",
            "Now, why you're gamma?",
            "There are a couple of different reasons for it.",
            "One reason is mathematical convenience.",
            "That's because the gamma is conjugate for the railway, an exponential distributions that are popularly used in the context of the independent Cascade model, which means that the posterior distribution of Alpha is also gamma distributed, and you can do the integration over Alpha in an analytically.",
            "There's also a more practical reason for using the gammas, because it makes sense in the context of network diffusion analysis.",
            "Specifically, what I mean by this is that for different settings of A&B in this prior we are able to model the sparse network assumption, which is typically the standard thing to do for network analysis.",
            "An Alternatively, if you don't want to make this assumption, you want to be a Bayesian, but you don't want to be biased.",

            "But what is more interesting is that for many properties they can be relaxed in a way where.",
            "The two operations can actually be done, you know, or at least one of the two operations can be done in exactly and efficiently.",
            "OK, let me be a little more precise about what I mean by this.",

            "In general, these such network centric properties are not nice in the sense that you cannot do both of these marginalization operations efficiently, but.",
            "There are some properties which are network nice.",
            "Now what I mean by this is that the integration over Alpha can actually be done in time that is linear in the size of the graph and this happens when the property function decomposes in a particular way.",
            "Specifically, it decomposes over zed and the individual Alpha UVS.",
            "Now similarly we also study Cascade centric properties where you try to compute scores of individual infections more generally, infection paths an again, not surprisingly, for very general casket centric properties you cannot do these marginalization's efficiently, but most of these properties can be relaxed in a way where you know the property decomposes in a particular way and you can actually do this part summation in time that is linear in the size of the Cascades.",
            "And then we'll call a property to be totally nice when the sequence of these two operations, the marginalization over zed and the marginalization over Alpha.",
