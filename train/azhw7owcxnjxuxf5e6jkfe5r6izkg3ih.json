            "You glue together.",
            "So that's why then afterwards it can heal much faster.",
            "A secret, so as far as I understand the one of principle points for you, is how does the light propagating side that issue and so do you have any mathematical model for this, like using model is easy.",
            "Is it applicable for this case or percolation or something like this?",
            "You mentioned Monte Carlo method but.",
            "So are there any mathematical models to which work properly for this?",
            "Problem.",
            "If the simulation simulations that we did we just get the simple model of light scattering and absorption inside the issue.",
            "So this simple model Ant Ray tracing Monte Carlo simulation.",
            "Not nothing special.",
            "OK, we can.",
            "Commercial software, commercial commercial software.",
            "OK thank you.",
            "When you insert the bids in the cells, do you have any control?",
            "How do you know that more than once one bit is not absorbed by the cell?",
            "Do you insert them mechanically?",
            "Or the droplets you inject one by one, but the droplets are just put to the cells and they eat them.",
            "And actually most of the time they eat more of them, which is actually even better.",
            "'cause as I showed you have done more different combinations so just with one one bit as attack, you have approximately 20,000.",
            "But you have more of them.",
            "You have more more possible combinations but you don't have any control over how many.",
            "That takes the cell, it's just probability if you put more of them than average, they have larger quantity inside, but you cannot control exactly the number is.",
            "No, can you make some?",
            "Some sort of?",
            "Future application.",
            "Do you have some ideas what?",
            "If for now mostly applications are for research, for example, I showed many different what you can do, for example tagging maybe really currently the most developed, and you can use this in the lab.",
            "So you take cells, you do some some experience with them and you read back so you know which cell each switch, which is which because they have barcode onto them until you when you do the experiment, then you know how each cell changed.",
            "And before before this was not possible.",
            "They were doing just large quantities of cells like population of cells, but in this way you can do individual one you know which one is rich, what is the typical intensity of this living cell lasers?",
            "Actually you can see with your eye like a very faint.",
            "Usually it's like none of what range.",
            "More sure.",
            "So my question is, in the first part you said you basically import some nanoparticles and do have an information?",
            "What is the what happens in the long term if these particles remain inside the cell, do they damage it or is completely safe?",
            "Would you put it in your body?",
            "Is it thank you.",
            "Um?",
            "If we didn't study like very long time, but in short term these cells there happy that divides and they survive.",
            "We measured it like 99% of the cells survive.",
            "But because these bits are some of them, they are quite large.",
            "That looked like this is the cell, and then it's a bit is a huge one.",
            "Probably they changed somehow the properties of the cell, but we also we are also working on smaller lasers.",
            "You can make them like below one Micron, so the cell is approximately 20 microns.",
            "So in this case the bit is 10 microns, so it has, but you can go 10 times less.",
            "For example, putting things inside cells for simple tattoos are such example when you make it the two normal one sells, it's the.",
            "The dye particles and they remain inside the cells.",
            "That's also why the tattoo is permanent, because the dye goes into the cell and the cell just survive for very long time and then divide.",
            "More.",
            "If not, I have another one.",
            "So I understood how you mean when you say that there is a laser inside the cell.",
            "I mean, you you mean that something is missing because you need something to activate so and understood how you can activate.",
            "Also in deep because you cannot just send light from outside because it lights absorbed.",
            "What is not clear to me is the vice versa.",
            "So when you activate inside body then you have to extract the light.",
            "And the light when you and the light comes out is absorbed by my other cells.",
            "So first of all.",
            "How you how you can make it?",
            "In second.",
            "So suppose that you have emission of many cells, so you have also interference between them.",
            "And if you don't have any any relation between the cells, I mean this interference may be destructive interference.",
            "So you may just destroy the signal you want to acquire.",
            "And I mean last.",
            "So to exploit instead this fact.",
            "In order to build the kind of coherent effect.",
            "So if you have a mission from different cells.",
            "That are instead coherently linked.",
            "I'm suppose that I don't know.",
            "I don't know if it is just stupid, but suppose that you have cells that they're doing the same thing, just with a different query and different phase, and they're emitting light.",
            "This light can in principle sum up, and so you may have a kind of increase of the signal, and this can also provide information about any coherent phenomenon inside the body.",
            "So I mean, it's a lot of things, but I don't know if you.",
            "And comment.",
            "OK so first question.",
            "So explains two ways of.",
            "Like overcome the absorption and scattering the tissues, one is with optical fiber.",
            "And if you have implant optical fiber, you can excite the lasers and you can also collect the light from the lasers so it's both direction is not a problem like.",
            "This one.",
            "At this one, the fiber, so it goes in both directions.",
            "And the other is bioluminescence, where you create really light inside.",
            "In that case the light doesn't come out, it is deep, yes, but if you want to use this slide for some treatments.",
            "Inside doesn't need to come out.",
            "If the demands inside this is OK. OK then about coherence.",
            "Reasonable, usually.",
            "Plain in simple words.",
            "Light is a kind of wave, so if you have many waves that are coming up together and there is no phase relation between them.",
            "I mean basically you have a flat C, But if you can in some way put this waves in phase so they sum up.",
            "And in the end you may have something interesting, but I don't know if you did I mean here is this is not.",
            "This is possible if you have a kind of geometry in your sample.",
            "Here.",
            "In principle you don't have any geometry, so maybe it's not so easy.",
            "Or maybe yes, I don't know.",
            "OK, so another way of explaining this so different lasers they blink in different way, right?",
            "They also have different different baselines, and if you take the light of all of them together, they just sum up all of this and you get the mess so you don't see anything.",
            "So usually to observe this lasers you need a microscope.",
            "Then take the Spectra from individual ones.",
            "Or actually, if you go with the fiber insight, usually just the laser that is closest to the fiber will then emit light.",
            "But you can also use.",
            "This day they have different peaks, even if you cannot see them, so that if there are below like more deep inside you, you get light from all of them out of the skin.",
            "But from the spectrum because you have multiple pics, you can actually determine if even if you don't see them.",
            "You can also say how many are there.",
            "Or actually based on the spectrum, you can also determine a little bit positions where there are so.",
            "So this is also useful in this way.",
            "OK, you said that this says.",
            "Basically it's this lasers.",
            "But why would they damn it's policy and is still poor and glass into?",
            "They think it's a foreign object, so some foreign object comes into into your body.",
            "The self wants to destroy it so they eat and actually they expose insight with some actually peroxide to expose the bit to.",
            "So you can for an optimal want to destroy them.",
            "You cannot control what what, what will one sell it?",
            "You're partially you can by making different surface of the beat if you put some chemicals on the surface, the cells will eat.",
            "If you don't put these chemicals or some other chemicals, they will not eat.",
            "But you can a little bit control.",
            "Basically these are.",
            "Special laser they just.",
            "Get laser light in and then emit.",
            "Yes, you need to source of energy from the outside, but here you cannot put wires inside, so you use some other light from the outside to activate them.",
            "Yes, so with light you deliver energy.",
            "Basically, these are some kind of mirrors that emit only one short wavelength.",
            "OK, thank you.",
            "More.",
            "So if not we just thanks matiash again.",
