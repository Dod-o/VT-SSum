            "So the first has to do with screening so children can be identified as being at risk for autism at a very early age, 2 years old, possibly younger, but the average diagnostic age is more like 4, so there's a fairly large window of opportunity.",

            "The right level of service.",
            "And so the question is, could we imagine technology that could monitor a therapy session, provide real time feedback and guidance to a therapist and essentially enable someone who does not have a lot of training to become an effective therapist for the child.",
            "So a teacher or a parent that wants to participate in this child's education and training could do so more effectively.",
            "So these are two goals that would, if we're successful, potentially have a big impact on the public health side.",
            "Of this disorder.",
            "And the third goal has to do with the research community, and if you look at the research in autism today, then there are three major pillars.",

            "So again, the question is, could technology be used as a way to allow researchers to process behavioral data more effectively to acquire behavioral data automatically, and then to search that data for behaviors of interest and analyze that data to find trends and find indications that may serve the research process?",

            "And the main thing she's trying to assess is how hard is it to socially engage this child, because children with autism typically lack the ability to engage with another person socially, and these difficulties in social engagement emerge and are visible at a very young age.",
