            "With changing dimension and the answer to that is that you that you use a space which has enough dimensions which has more dimensions than you usually need.",
            "It has enough dimensions for you to explain all possible samples that you might look at.",
            "And typically if we don't want to bound the number of samples before hand, that will mean that we need an infinite dimensional space.",

            "The non parametric character is not really the infinite dimensional space.",

            "OK, and.",

            "So you discretize your domain and just use those 10 selling points, and then when you see an observation, you map it to the closest point and just use that.",
            "As a substitute.",
            "Yeah, and as long as you have sample sizes like 102 hundred points or something like that, for all practical purposes, estimator like that would behave in a nonparametric fashion so that the really nonparametric character is that you don't use all parameters and you need some rule for your model.",

            "Yeah, the second problem is that if you just make it too large then we get back to this problem of the powerset, which is so complicated that we can't even define a proper measure on it.",

            "You can't.",
            "You could represent this measure here.",
            "By integrating.",
            "Integrating Deam YouTube right so you could do.",

            "Integrating the constant one function against VMU two of X.",
            "If you actually give you more to here and that means that this expression and this expression here, at least under the integral, are the same, they are not necessarily the same, but they integrate in the same manner.",
            "And that is why people have by people use this this notation here, which looks kind of like a derivative notation like the lightness notation for derivative.",
            "So DMU two of X is density times DMU one of X. OK. And so you see that here we have.",
            "This is again, this is applying the measure to the volume element.",
            "And what's different here to the normal measure formalism is that this is not a set right?",

            "So if we write Mewtwo, then it's applied to a set.",
            "But if you're right, D Mewtwo is applied to a point.",
            "OK. And you could think here for example of if this year is is Mewtwo.",
            "If this is a Gaussian measure.",
            "And Gaussian probability measure and mu one here is the lebec measure.",
            "So the measure which assigns volume on the real line then this year would be the Gaussian density.",
            "And.",
            "That brings us back to.",
            "To what I said in the beginning, that one reason why we have to use measures and infinite dimensions is becausw many infinite dimension distributions don't have a useful density.",
            "The problem here is that the density, the density is always defined with respect to some other measure.",
            "Density is not a standalone object.",
            "You have to define it with respect to some reference measure, and in this case here for the Gaussian, the reference measure in the standard Gaussian density, the reference measure is flatly back measure.",
            "This kind of uniform measure on the real line now.",
            "In order for this to be meaningful to to work with this density in the way we usually like to work with it, this measure has to be.",
            "It has to be neutral.",
            "It has to be flat.",
            "If you think of if you could very well right one Gaussian represented as a density with respect to another Gaussian, say another Gaussian measure was a different location parameter.",
            "But then interpreting interpreting this density here becomes really hard.",
            "Because it means that when at the point where this Gaussian here has its mode, this density has to decrease to make up for the mode.",
            "Yeah, and so you always have to when you want to interpret what a larger or smaller density means, you would always have to look back at the other measure and check is a large in that region or not.",
            "So in order for the density to be to be interpretable, you want it to be defined with respect to some some neutral measure and neutrality is formalized as translation invariants.",
            "So the lebec measure, or the measure that which assigns volume.",
            "You can show it around on the on the real line, and it never changes with respect to location if you have.",
            "Volume of the same size at different points on the real line or in Euclidean space.",
            "It always has the same volume assigned to it, right?",
            "There was a question there.",
            "So in the case of the normal density you were saying, the measure is the communitive distribution.",
            "Well, almost so the question is, is to measure the cumulative distribution.",
            "Not quite, so the cumulative distribution is you start at minus Infinity.",
            "And integrate all the way to your current point.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Whereas the.",
            "The measure can be.",
            "Can be an arbitrary set, so the cumulative distribution in that case would be the measure of the interval.",
            "The open interval minus Infinity up to your point.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Sorry, I didn't quite follow the translation invariant somehow connected to the existence or not.",
            "Yes, so in the problem with the translation in variance is the following.",
            "Hadn't finished that yet, so.",
            "OK, so in in basically in Euclidean space the translation in variance is a property which makes which makes a density that translation invariants of this measure is a property which makes a density useful.",
            "Now when we go to infinite dimensional space A Hilbert space.",
            "Yeah, then we don't.",
            "There's there's no translation invariant measure on Hilbert space.",
            "Yeah, infinite dimensional spaces don't have a translation invariant measure, and that's even even Hilbert space.",
            "Even though Hilbert space is kind of the most.",
            "The nicest and most unproblematic infinite dimensional space.",
            "And yeah, so there's there's no analogue of the lebec measure in infinite dimensional spaces, which is.",
            "Um?",
            "So basically the whole notion of a volume in infinite dimensions becomes a bit flakey.",
            "OK, so and that means that that in order to in order to work on infinite dimensional spaces, densities are often not an option, so you can have something like a Gaussian probability on infinite dimensional space, and that's Gaussian process and it does have a density, so you can write the density of 1 Gaussian process with respect to another one.",
            "But that's just not a very helpful object.",
            "OK. How do you distinguish?",
            "These sets, which have measurable don't have measures, so whoever says don't have these translation measure so Hilbert space, you can define measures on Hilbert space, but you cannot define is a measure that.",
            "That basically does does not change that.",
            "Is it flat?",

            "Why is it like that OK?",

            "It doesn't immediately say anything about translation invariants, but the problem was volume in infinite space is say you have.",
            "Say you're looking at A at a cube with edge length, say 1/2.",
            "Yeah, so in one dimension that's just an interval.",
            "The volume of that is 1/2.",

            "1/4 write in three dimensions.",
            "The volume is 1 eighth and so on.",

            "Those volume zeros volume one and those with infinite volume.",

            "So if you have a smooth volume and you want to take the measure of that, then you approximate volume by cubes that you make smaller and smaller.",

            "This would be the preimage of A and we get the preimage of B under under Y.",

            "Or this one had to be really, really simple.",
            "There's no reason why the space has to be complicated if we just have a very simple experiment over here, but basically for every every other observation that we want to add everything we want to condition up on every dimension we want to add in our feature space or whatever we need to have enough complexity over here to accommodate that, and so usually we just want to say, OK.",

            "Now the question is what is the probability of this random event?",
            "And the probability of that is induced by the probability measure over here.",
            "Becausw as I said here.",
            "So if if we have a set here.",
            "And then ask for the event the random variable takes a value in that set, say set set a. Yeah, that happens if and only if Omega has taken a value in the pre image of that set under X.",
            "And so the probability of of this event is the probability P. The measure P of the preimage over here.",
            "And that is how the measure P here induces a probability over here.",
            "Yeah, if we have a second second space here then we get a probability and used the same way through the 2nd random variable and so on.",
            "And that is what we do here.",
            "Yeah so.",
            "The probability that X Omega is in some set a where a is a subset of the space.",
            "Here is the probability the measure P which is defined over here.",
            "The measure P of the preimage of that set.",
            "And all our probabilities.",
            "We assume that all our probabilities that we define that might be a coin flip probability here and a Gaussian probability over here, and then a Gaussian process over here direct person whatever that they're all derived from the same probability measure in this way.",
            "And whether or not they correlate in some way depends on how what these mappings look like.",
