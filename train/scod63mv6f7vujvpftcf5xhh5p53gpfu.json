            "Particular words as such, it's in the interest is in the degree of variability that you might expect to get over the vocabulary and to find out what that is and then to see how that relates to the sort of average corpus use and ideally to see whether we can track this sort of idea of meaning, negotiation and meaning, variation, and so on.",

            "Because they are simply different degrees of order, freedom and certain variants of the language, and I guess the same thing would carry over to other parts of soft constraints in grammar and in semantics almost everything is soft, so it would also carry over to most parts of semantics.",
