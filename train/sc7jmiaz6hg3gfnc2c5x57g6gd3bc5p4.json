            "I, ladies and gentlemen, I feel very honored to have been invited here for this key plenary Electra.",
            "As you know, I'm an outsider to your community.",
            "I know I think three people here in the room before I arrive.",
            "Having spent the day here, I know a few more and when I leave, I hope that you will remember what I have said.",
            "This is a piece of old technology here.",
            "And maybe it's a reminder that despite all our talk about innovation and high tech, the world still is based upon old technologies and one of the latest books by Historian of Technology.",
            "It has the title, the shock of the old, so maybe this is part of the shock of the old.",
            "You asked me to speak about competition being one of the leading themes of your conference.",
            "And since I come from a field which is called science and technology studies, much of what I have to say will come from that particular experience.",
            "Now undoubtedly, competition is one of the defining.",
            "Characteristics of our age.",
            "Our SOC's are driven by competition, run by competition and this of course is also very much true.",
            "For educational institutions.",
            "You feel the competition you have to be able to compete and you want to be able to convey to your students what it needs to compete.",
            "Once they have left you.",
            "Now economists tell us that competition most of the time ensures that price serves as a good signal for quality.",
            "But in science and in research, competition is very deeply entrenched.",
            "And when you go back to the beginning of modern science, 17th century more or less, it's a very market beginning of competition.",
            "In the sense that what we had before, namely pre modern knowledge generation technology generation was based largely on secrecy.",
            "You were taught by a master in a master student relationship.",
            "The knowledge was deliberately kept secret and therefore also its spread and use outside was rather limited, and this was one of the.",
            "Transformations that was brought about by modern science that for the first time competing knowledge claims were brought out openly.",
            "And just to cite you one example, the Royal SoC in Great Britain, which in the 17th century was one of several of such SOC's of what was in that time called natural philosophers coming together.",
            "They were staging open competitions, so you were invited to the place where the Royal SoC met in London and you had experiments being performed here.",
            "This is bitch, like a theatrical performance and you could see as an invited audience, sort of the competition going on and the invited audience was part of the general public.",
            "But of course there were fine distinctions as to who belonged to the general public.",
            "These were, gentlemen and gentlemen meant at that time you had to have your own independent economic means.",
            "Which meant that women were excluded because women were either wives or daughters and did not have their independent economic means.",
            "Because only if you had your own economic means where you thought to be sufficiently independent to judge what you would see in terms of competing knowledge claims.",
            "Now it was not only the experimental setup which was of course crucial.",
            "But also the public staging of knowledge in terms of competition and this has been the beginning, but it is very much part of the way how science and research has been conducted over these last 350 years.",
            "Science priding itself to be an institution based on meritocracy, which means it does not count who you are or where you come from.",
            "Or how much money you have.",
            "The only thing that counts is what you say and whether your peers judge what you say is being valid knowledge, reliable knowledge, knowledge that can be repeated in other experimental setups.",
            "And this of course was related to the fact that knowledge claims dealing with natural phenomena.",
            "What counted was does it work?",
            "Or does it not work and this was the outcome in the ultimate judge?",
            "Now also our educational institutions pride themselves to be based on meritocracy, although we know that in particularly in the last 30 years or so, together with widening income gaps in our societies.",
            "Also the access to the best educational institution has become much more skewed.",
            "And Paul Krugman the recent Nobel Prize winner in Economics, has put it very clearly.",
            "He says many of the economic and social trends assure that the children of wealthy parents have a huge advantage over those and mind his words, who choose to have the wrong parents.",
            "And I think this is a reminder that a principal.",
            "Of meritocracy, in itself is not enough if you do not take into account also the preconditions that allow or prevent access of the best minds to the best institutions.",
            "Now for research and for science the reward in competition is not money, it is reputation, its credibility.",
            "In terms of reputation that accrues to you by others using your work and your results, and This is why competition is fierce as it may become in science and you have competing teams you had in former times where the information transmission was much slower, you had very fierce fights about priorities.",
            "Who had discovered a new star or who had discovered a new phenomenon in nature?",
            "These priority fights have receded because by now we know who is working on what and therefore.",
            "Competition is channeled in in different ways.",
            "Also universities and I mentioned this before have become subject to competition.",
            "You have the various kinds of rankings, research, assessment exercises, etc.",
            "Were funding depends on the outcome of such competitions.",
            "Competition in science and in research is institutionalized through.",
            "Peer review now.",
            "Peer review you all know it.",
            "You use it yourself.",
            "You sent out your peers to the institutions that you want to a credit.",
            "You use it in journals etc.",
            "As the peer review system and everyone agrees on this has its flaws, but it's a bit like democracy.",
            "It's hard to find a better way of doing things, and the peer review serves essentially two functions.",
            "First, reform.",
            "It is a very strong claim to the autonomy of science as an institution against external influence.",
            "Scientific community insists through its rigorous application of peer review, that no political or in previous times religious external influence should distort what the scientific community does.",
            "Therefore it has this very strong claim of guarding.",
            "It's it's autonomy, but it also serves as a way of certifying reliable knowledge because it is only after having passed peer review that publications, which is a way of sharing the knowledge that has been generated with other peers, but also with the wider world.",
            "Is there some kind of guarantee?",
            "This knowledge is reliable knowledge that you can build appan and workup on.",
            "Now, what are some of the limitations of the peer review system?",
            "The flaws exist, no doubt, and we all have experienced them in our personal lives.",
            "Journal articles that we thought were great have been rejected as proposes research that have been submitted for research funding have not had success, etc.",
            "So there are flaws undoubtedly on.",
            "The other hand, the peer review system, as I said, is the best we have and if I may just briefly mention the institution where have the privilege now to help to build it up.",
            "the European Research Council, which is a very novel innovative institution because it is the first time ever that basic research we call it Frontier Research is funded at EU level.",
            "Before the European Research Council, it was left to Member States to fund basic research.",
            "And the EU, according to the existing pretis you was funding, only research projects and research which was helping European industry to compete.",
            "So it had a very instrumental side to it and I think it was due to the globalization and the realization that unless Europe also starts to invest.",
            "In a concentrated way into frontier research, it will lose out and one of the reasons behind is that worldwide the relationship between universities and industry has changed.",
            "Industry now and business can get the knowledge it needs anywhere in the world.",
            "And therefore universities have to be brought have to be made much more competitive.",
            "In terms of the knowledge they produce and this also is particularly true for frontier research, which is the basis for everything that comes afterwards in the European Research Council, we have about 1 billion euro on average annually, which may sound much, but it is far too little in terms of the actual demand and we have decided to devote.",
            "One certificate for the so-called starting grants young investigators, but we will change this figure in the near future to 50% because the demand among younger researchers in Europe has shown that it's really there where the investment for Europe's future is taking place.",
            "Peer review comes in because the excellence that we.",
            "Are striving for the excellence, that is the only criteria for getting a research grant from the ER C has to be done in a credible way and my personal definition of excellence is that I usually say excellence is very difficult to define.",
            "But you recognize it when you encounter it and you recognize it when you encounter it means.",
            "There is a relation between the peers.",
            "Who have to be able to recognize excellence when they encounter it and This is why we have tried really to get the very best people from Europe but also from outside of Europe to serve on our panels.",
            "We have set up 25 panels for all areas of science and this includes social Sciences and the humanities.",
            "But one of the limitations of peer review is that it is not particularly amenable for interdisciplinary research.",
            "And especially in frontier research, disciplinary boundaries are not respected.",
            "You transgress disciplinary boundaries because this is where the innovation, in terms of new knowledge occurs very often.",
            "And so we have set up a special part of our budget and we devote 13% of our budget now only for interdisciplinary proposals.",
            "Because we think this is the way to go forward and to recognize this.",
            "One of the.",
            "Effects of competition in science is something again that you recognize very much from your own experience, and it can be summarized by what Robert Merton, the sociologist of science we back called.",
            "The Matthew principle comes from Matthew from the Bible and it refers to the.",
            "The observation that those who have will be given, in other words, the process leads to a concentration both in terms of institutions and in terms of individual biographies.",
            "If you start very early on your chances in a good trajectory and a good career path are that you will be able to accumulate further grants further advantages.",
            "And we see similar things happening with institutions, which of course also means that competition leads to uneven distribution in terms of political geography.",
            "Certain parts of Europe's have a concentration of very good science, very good educational institutions, others in particular in the new Member States, it is a difficult transition period in which they find themselves.",
            "But the importance is that both upward and downward mobility must be possible.",
            "So in open system allows both for some of the laggards to move up, and those who are too confident to move downwards.",
            "No, I have spoken why competition about why competition is entrenched in science.",
            "The historical background and the way how the peer review system sort of summarizes, embodies the way how competition in science works.",
            "But I wanted to remind you that it is always balanced with Corporation because in the end you want your colleagues to use the results.",
            "Of course, with acknowledging it, but you want them to use the results that you have produced.",
            "Looking now at the wider context, we can see that this idea of competing knowledge claims of competition in terms of assuring quality of accountability of transparency has spread much beyond science and research and Michael powers, among others, has spoken about the audit.",
            "SoC as it kind of sort of self reflection and internalization of constant auditing of what you are doing and why you are doing it as having become one of the tendencies that we see in our SoC.",
            "I just mentioned here the numerous rankings assessment exercises that go on.",
            "The very often this new trend towards shifting towards metrics and quantifications, the belief in numbers as giving you certainty about very complex processes is another trend that we can observe.",
            "And even though we know how these metrics come about and people in academia usually are not the most stupid people, so they know very quickly how to manipulate how to strategize what they are presenting to the auditors and assessors.",
            "So you have a constant tendency or possibility of distorting, because decision makers believe in numbers.",
            "This is a danger that I see.",
            "Quantification of course is part of the game, but there are instances where an excessive belief in objectivity can lead you very much astray because you suspend human judgment and even the airplane industry had to realize if you have only completely automatised planes flying.",
            "It's not such a good idea after all, because there are moments when the human judgment of the pilot is essential and in a similar way I feel going too far in terms of believing in numbers and dispensing with the judgment of peers might also lead us to crashes.",
            "Now I want to sort of enter this first part of my presentation with a question.",
            "Have we gone too far?",
            "In terms of this constant evaluation and assessment, if ranking golf auditing of the sort of introspection that we continuously practice and my answer is yes and no, yes, if we start to define excellence or very good quality only in one dimension.",
            "Think accidents, whatever field you look at is multi dimensional and if you reduce it to one dimension you are losing out what excellence actually embodies, namely that it is able to cross several domains that it embodies.",
            "The creativity that is the driving force that you stifle the curiosity that is essential to to move research.",
            "Forward.",
            "I think we have gone too far again.",
            "If diversity and distributed problem solving are wiped out or if human judgment is ignored in terms of quantification and metrics only.",
            "I think we have not gone too far.",
            "If we realize that competition has to remain one of the defining characteristics because only by having knowledge claims compete you can.",
            "Bring force and enable the sort of critical attitude.",
            "The critical sceptical attitude, which again is one way of how knowledge production has to operate.",
            "Take nothing for granted.",
            "Question, be assumptions.",
            "Bring your students to a critical understanding and not just of accepting a formula or accepting what the teacher says and my idea of what we should do when we train students, whether it's in management or whether it's in any one of the disciplines that which teach at universities.",
            "I would like us to.",
            "Have a generation of what I called competent rebels.",
            "Rebels in the sense that they do not accept what you are telling them and think we as teachers should be proud if we have students who challenge our received wisdom but at the same time they have to be competent rebels and it's competent rebels that bring the community further.",
            "It's those adventurers.",
            "Young, very often young people who venture outside the known territory who take the risk that maybe there is a Cliff for which you may fall off, but it's important for the community to know that such a Cliff exists.",
            "No, you also asked me to address the question of knowledge and expertise.",
            "So.",
            "Watch is competition about I spoke about competing knowledge claims and competing knowledge claims are the result of the production of new knowledge, which is what the research is about and.",
            "Basic research in particular is about the unknown, the unpredictable one.",
            "Inherent feature of basic research is you're driven by curiosity, but you do not know where curiosity will lead you to.",
            "And while in development in particular, you use already existing knowledge to apply it to come up with a new product or a new process.",
            "Now this.",
            "Unpredictability and new knowledge.",
            "It is something that you cannot just derive from looking out there.",
            "The view that there is even physical reality that you can just take in as it is just is not tenable.",
            "We are looking at the world framed by an epistemic culture.",
            "We all have different epistemic foundations on which we stand.",
            "Different cultures that construct what we see in different ways and let me just exemplify this, tell you a little bit about a controversy that now goes on after the crisis at the financial collapse, is that we're witnessing, and it's a controversy among the physicists who have moved into a field called econophysics.",
            "And we know that many of the brightest.",
            "Young physicists choose to work in Wall Street and similar places, setting up risk models, risk assessment models, etc.",
            "And economists who of course are part of the same enterprise.",
            "And now there's an interesting controversy going on.",
            "Who's fault is it?",
            "After all, having?",
            "Offered these models to us.",
            "What I find interesting is that the physicists very clearly say and make a sharp point that their way of looking at stock market fluctuations in particular differs very much from the way how economists look at them.",
            "Economists see them in terms of normal distribution.",
            "It's the Gaussian distribution, so you have a median.",
            "And of course you have.",
            "Sometimes a fat tail, sometimes a long tail, but it is statistical Gaussian approach.",
            "While physicists insist that they have no theory to explain what goes on, but they have an empirical law, namely the power law, the power law which tells you as the scale of a phenomenon increases, the frequency decreases.",
            "If I take the example of an earthquake.",
            "If you have an earthquake of twice the size than the previous.",
            "Earthquake the frequency is only four times, so it is four times as rare.",
            "And physicists say these power law phenomenon are very widespread in natural phenomena like like earthquakes, but also others and the stock market also is a phenomenon that obeys to this empirical power law and I mentioned this because it shows you.",
            "It is important.",
            "What is the epistemic cultural framework in which you work and that it is necessary to question the assumptions.",
            "Of the models that that you are using, an so physicists are the ones who were much more pessimistic in terms of a real big earthquake hitting than economists.",
            "And they also argue that in over connected system is worse and not better for encouraging large fluctuations.",
            "So what we know.",
            "Is framed in an epistemic way.",
            "It's a caution against taking over assumptions for phenomenon and cases and contexts for which they may not be suitable.",
            "And this brings me to something that.",
            "Perhaps is a wake up call, not just for management studies, but I think that's for our universities in general.",
            "That in terms of crisis as the one we are now, not just facing, but we're in the middle of it.",
            "To start to think seriously about curriculum reform, universities have been sort of swamped by the Bologna process.",
            "And they have reacted to it more or less embracing or hostile depending on many factors, but practically everywhere, the Bologna process has been looked at as a architectural form, but not in terms of content and what it means.",
            "And perhaps now the time has come to start to think seriously.",
            "What is it that we want?",
            "To teach and convey to the next generation in the BA in the MA, in in the doctoral level and arguably curriculum change and curriculum reform, may be one of the most significant changes University can undertake.",
            "And to prepare themselves and their students for a world to come that cannot be predicted.",
            "Now where, in this knowledge production and the way how universities deal with it.",
            "Where does experience come in experience, in my view, is first of all, related to experiment.",
            "Experience comes out of experiments that willingly or unwillingly you have undertaken in the past or you were thrust into a situation where you were experimenting not just experience but experimenting with situations that were posing a challenge to you.",
            "Experience means that the knowledge that you drew out of those instances of experiments of biographical experiments.",
            "Also, this knowledge has settled and so has the skills and the practice that you have gained in them.",
            "Experience means that you can black box the knowledge up to a certain extent.",
            "The black box can of course always be opened.",
            "It is being opened in controversies.",
            "It is being opened in crisis because you are forced to look into what is in the black box.",
            "What is still valid and useful and what not.",
            "And experience, therefore, is very much specialized because it is based on a particular domain on the experience that individuals, groups, societies, companies, whatever have had under given circumstances, the skills that were gained in going through this experience equally limited because no individual can can have.",
            "And master.",
            "All the skills that are necessary at the same time it shows you that without experience, without the routine that we have gained in it life would not be bearable and an possible but.",
            "And this is a crucial point.",
            "Whenever we use experience, it's not for its own sake.",
            "We want to use the experience we want to apply it in situations that are new.",
            "That are challenging.",
            "You draw upon the resources that you have gained through the experience, experiments and the experience.",
            "Whenever you take it to a new context, experience becomes transgressive.",
            "You are saying things you are forced in a way to apply the knowledge you have, which is never completely matching.",
            "The kind of questions that you are asked to answer or that you address yourself so experience means there is a transgressive element in it.",
            "You claim to know more than you actually know because you are asked to extend and to apply what you know to cases that are new to you.",
            "In other words, you extend.",
            "Past knowledge and skills to present and future and in doing so.",
            "You are of course exposing yourself, but it's a necessary transgressive iti and This is why diversity in terms of experience is so important.",
            "If we look at expertise is professional expertise is scientific.",
            "Technological expertise is in terms of technological disasters, for instance, or if you look at the BSE crisis that.",
            "Was such a dramatic incident.",
            "What was it?",
            "10 or 15 years ago in in the UK?",
            "The lessons that were drawn afterwards very often come down to the point the basis of expertise that was drawn upon in such incidents was too narrow.",
            "In the case of PSA in the UK, turned out that the experts that were drawn in immediately afterwards came.",
            "From one ministry.",
            "Named the Ministry of Agriculture and not from the Ministry of Health and it would have been extremely important to get experts both from the Ministry of Agriculture that know about cows and how cattle behaves and the Ministry of Health that knows something about species barriers and the transmission of disease.",
            "And so I could quote you many other examples where in cases of disaster and when things go wrong.",
            "We start to realize that we need a broader basis for expertise that comes from different angles from different disciplines from different ministries from different parts of society.",
            "Even.",
            "And this also means that when you try to integrate knowledge and expertise experience, you must make room for dissenting voices.",
            "Just as I said, it's important to have competent rebels.",
            "In the classroom and in your schools, I think it is important to make room for dissenting voices to hear them to hear an argument that otherwise would not have been presented and to take it into account.",
            "No, I will wrap up, but allow me still to touch one more topic and I will be free from that innovation.",
            "The dynamics of innovation, and here certainly science and technology, are one of the driving forces, although everywhere there is consensus that it's firms that innovate.",
            "It's not so much universities, it is bringing new knowledge or incremental case of incremental.",
            "Innovation to bring improvements to the market as quickly as possible.",
            "No in disconnection.",
            "We can again see historically one important change that occurred in Europe around 1800.",
            "You can say Europeans, but also Chinese and other SOC's.",

            "I realize there's still a long way to go from the lab out to the market, but I want to make 3 concluding remarks in.",
            "In this connection, the first is that both research, in particular basic research and the process of innovation, share one characteristic.",
            "Namely, they are inherently uncertain.",
            "In basic research you don't know the outcome and I would say the innovation process, although the mechanisms differ also is be set by inherent uncertainty and rather than looking at uncertainty is something that you want to shy away from.",
            "I think we should adopt A more positive attitude towards uncertainty and this is particularly the case.",
            "Future is always uncertain, but I think the future we are facing now has become very fragile and I think unless we brave ourselves to look at it as something that is inherent in the process of innovating inherent in the process of research, you will not be able to move forward.",

            "Europe is very good scientists and engineers, but in terms of innovation, the Americans are faster and better etc.",
            "And there is something to it.",
            "Four and it is many reasons, but something that is overlooked in the discussion usually has to do with a particular phase in the research process, namely when in the labs.",
            "New research technologies are created and research technologies are necessary for basic research, and I think the Americans have understood that.",
            "If you link up with firms at this crucial state, which is still the state of basic research, you let them see what your research technologies can do.",
            "You invite them in and you bring them in to draw conclusions for their users, which differ of course from the users you find in the labs.",
            "Think we miss an opportunity.",
            "And the Third Point I want to make is that talking so much about innovation.",
            "We are.",
            "My view much too often focusing only on the technological side, and we tend to overlook that innovation very much also means social innovation.",
            "It means innovation in social organization and I would go so far to say the more science and technological innovation.",

            "That would be able to cope with the potential if this would arrive tomorrow, there would be enormous problems in how actually to utilize what science and technology have to offer, and this is again one example of many of how the social innovative site and the social organization side is important to a company so.",
            "To conclude, knowledge and experience, I think can be integrated, keeping in mind that experience is always transgressive and that you should remain aware that you are transgressing what you know already.",

            "One part of it.",
            "So I think you have to come up with a way of making social innovations visible.",
