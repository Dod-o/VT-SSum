            "And then why we can have this diversity?",
            "Because we have different languages because we have different terminologies or we can have different different modeling so that work focused on a particular thing.",

            "This heterogeneity and diversity?",

            "Let's say for in this case you can.",
            "You can use those correspondences for merging two ontologies of Aquarians, wherein offer navigation on the web of linked data if you want.",

            "Now we do some reflection on how those years went and so in that year back there were already more than sorry systems doing doing matching and here are heroes and names like like Cupid, Coma and also let's say the then the Naive ontology machine approach, which is the first name here is is a is a runner up for the for this event.",
            "So basically for this award so basically.",
            "Let's say this was still Hott Field, and it it it remains, but So what was what made the difference as we sing?",
            "So this is our point of view.",
            "So let us think of the of the output.",
            "So we talk about this correspondence is that should link the entities in situ ontologies.",
            "So what has been happening?",
            "That's how?",
            "How do you?",
            "What do you compute this output?",
            "And typically most systems were computing various similarity measures for producing alignments in 01.",
            "So saying that OK. We have something in one ontologies that matches in the other one with probability.",
            "If you want of 0 sale and then some system we're not even interpreting these these similarities as probabilities of there.",
            "They were just clues.",
            "So we decided to be a little bit more precise in this and qualify this correspondences as logical relations.",
            "So we say, OK, we try to compute explicitly, we will in some Sumption or or disjointness.",
            "So this can be useful at the second step when you have to merge or you have to answer queries you already have some some relations with with explicit semantics.",
            "So this was one point and another one is how do you?",
            "How do you compute what types of methods do you use?",

            "This is what many people do.",
            "They you calculate similarities, you calculate distances you you play with them you have thresholds.",
            "This we also followed that path because this is inevitable.",
            "So there was what was distinguishing feature.",
            "Here I think is that one of the steps of this matching process was sound and complete and what and it should be a particularly pleasant especially for this community.",
            "So this two features I think that on one side as output we were computing explicitly logical relations like equivalence, subsumption and on the other side besides.",
            "Although you risztics we have been using, there was also one step that was sound incomplete."
        ],
        [
            "So just to give you an idea of what we talked about.",

            "Just a very simple example where you have two passes.",

            "So this is taken as input and then what we get this output as a relationship like in this case that that you see so.",

            "Already discussed so.",

            "How do we arrive to that to that step that actually sound incomplete.",
            "So what we did is that we translate the matching problem into propositional validity problem and then we used to resolve the propositional validity problem.",
            "They propositional satisfiability solvers and we start in this case with the state of the art.",
            "We just use 10 another which which were available and here.",

            "How, how?",
            "How can you do that?",
            "But actually doing some evaluations?",

            "Time.",
            "So just.",
            "To give you some more detail, going a little bit more in detail and say how how did we organize this idea and these are 4 four micro steps for the algorithm, but I will not show you the algorithm of course.",
            "So what we did you take as input.",
            "These two trees and then we analyze the labels of these trees in isolation and at that point we go from natural language to propositional logic.",
            "And then at the second step we analyze this structure.",
            "So basically we we know what happens at labels, But then we analyze notes.",
            "This is basically where labels seating the trees.",
            "At the third step, we computed relations between these.",
            "We call it atomic Concepts at label.",
            "So basically we build our theory within which we want to reason, and this reasoning is performed at the at the four step.",
            "So the first steps is A is a preprocessing phase.",
            "If you want so you do it once for all and then actually matching you perform it at the 3rd and the 4th step."

        [
            "So what actually we match and what we meant specifically by ontology.",
            "So here there is a specific case that we called them lightweight ontologies and and in this case you can think of the user classifications of web directories and and so on.",
            "So this is the first step that anyhow we have to do in code what we have in input in some formalism.",
            "In this case we talk propositional description logic.",
            "But think of else without rolls with what basically means that we can go.",

            "What happens?",
            "Yes it breaks or you use other you risztics or use another using other background now."

        [
            "So just to show you the example that we saw before, so we have this labels like journals and below you see journals one what means that this is a sense number one that that you have been warned.",
            "And of course here you have all the disambiguation you have to do or sense filtering and in order to arrive to the formal.",

            "So this I just point you to the the last bullet that saying that we had visualization and usability problems of course.",
            "So you start very early, you sound you have some results, but then what we saw that already with three versus 4 nodes, this can become clumsy and a little bit awkward, so this was one of the, let's say, motivation.",

            "The waters, so let us first stop, let's say sequentially.",

            "And what this extension I've been doing has been doing is that you take you take this to three.",

            "And why this structure preserving simply becausw functions should be matched functions and variables to variable, so you cannot match the message to an argument in this case.",
