            "We feel for clarity.",
            "We explain this as one cycle, but it's not necessarily a cycle where you're describing really is is some meaning that the child has in his mind he's telling you about that which is just composition.",
            "At some stage he decides this is not exciting enough so it actually goes jumps back to this little square and start inventing stuff and injecting it into the thing.",

            "Free.",
            "So the the interpretation part that you do.",
            "I may be thinking of this wrong, but it seems like your.",
            "Your writing agent or story producing agent narrative agent is building a model of the receiver agent.",

            "And if it is, what if there's more than one receiver?",
            "Don't you have to model each one because everybody reads a story a little bit different and then things get out of hand.",
            "That's one of the questions and the related one is can you bring any game theory and or does it make sense to think about this in a game theoretic way?",
            "If you are modeling the other agents and there's a multi agent sort of OK.",
            "In a way you can see the interpretation as having a model of the receiver.",
            "And you can have multiple models.",
            "And so in an even if you don't, you can have multiple interpretations.",

            "You may want literature and poetry is full of.",

            "They're all the same moment you try and expand it into 20 sentences.",

            "Well, whoever made them record and there were different enough to be worth making.",

            "We've certainly used it at the invention stage to give us a skeletonwitch to hang things.",
            "But the good thing here is that if you can reduce that skeleton to the invention stage, then you can add the detail during the composition and so still see advantages in seeing it this way.",
            "Can one quick question I like very much your ideas and I was wondering if you had thought and how one of these elements influence the others for simple validation.",
            "Maybe just start having some kind of validation but you realize and transmission that maybe you should change this or or interpretation.",
            "Have you thought about that?",
            "How yes, and there's a little more on that in the paper and I think we review some of the existing psychological models of the writing task.",
            "And the engagement and reflection cycle as a possible model as well.",
            "Obviously validation you can validate the interpreter, meaning the message, the discourse the intended meaning, the impression that the intention.",
            "So I think this should be really full of arrows and they all interact in different ways.",
            "And again, I'm sure that the real thing to cover the full phenomena should be very, very complex.",
            "Right now we're trying to everybody's trying to partition this into something simpler to deal with, and that's why there's so many takes.",
            "On this and what I'm trying to do is find a way in which we can look at all of them as.",
            "Instantiation's of partial instantiations of this, but there's certainly a lot of work to do there.",
