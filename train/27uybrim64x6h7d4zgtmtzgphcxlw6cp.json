            "Builds this models.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes, so just in time it's often it's used the time the parts come at, that time when the customer requested, but it could be, for example, that the supplier has got a warehouse and delivering just in time but from its stock, and the idea of just in sequences to avoid stock.",
            "So also the suppliers they asked to produce.",
            "The same sequence as the OEM's so deliver in the right sequence the same sequence as the car is being produced at the OEM side and then to synchronize the delivery with the production of cars.",
            "So really, without any warehouse, it's rusted on the transportation site on the truck where for example seats.",
            "It's a very good example where it is used.",
            "The seats are already produced in the same order sequence as the cars, and then at one point of the production of the OEM the seats are then entered and without any warehouse without control they are.",
            "One to one.",
            "Brought into production and then put in the next car.",

            "That's also what, uh, what's more and more common.",
            "So every plant, every production plant of the OEM.",
            "This is put in the position to produce different models.",
            "In the past they had one one Model 1 plant and now they are asking much more flexibility and produce Everything Everywhere for different markets.",
            "Smart manufacturing, yeah smart.",
            "Our cars, yeah.",
            "Reduction.",
            "Yes possible.",
            "It's both, it's an advantage.",
            "Yeah, yeah, it's an advantage for both so.",
            "Finally, it's an advantage for us for the clients, so we buy a car and we have see opportunity to change the car just a few days before we receive it.",
            "So this is this is a major idea to make more business to sell more options.",
            "Is the idea of the OEMs cause a lot of money with the options?",
            "So if you choose large navigation system, entertainment and so on, this is where the real margin is in the car and.",
            "And then for the suppliers is also an advantage 'cause if they have less material, less stock.",
            "Inventory is very expensive, so they have also cost advantage.",
            "So it's for the whole supply chain, it's.",

            "Market.",
            "Perhaps for the United States of America.",

            "It used to be.",

            "Also for the other cars.",
            "And it's more if you see the dimensions.",
            "It's depending on the parts so for the high.",
            "Value parts and high volume parts and there it makes more sense if you have small parts like screws it doesn't matter.",
            "So it's yeah, it's more on the value of the parts.",
            "OK, and the certain temporary supply chain networks.",
            "This is something which is more and more common.",
            "So in in the past we had a very strong relation between supplier and OEM which was mainly fixed and not changed.",
            "Now it's really flexible.",
            "The production time of the cars.",
            "It's reduced the life cycle of the cars are reduced, so we have more changing change of partners and if you for example see for expiring and Portia now for example, who is the OEM?",
            "Is a supplier of Portia, so it's everything is moving.",
            "Suppliers can become clients and the way around and the partners are changing so we need interoperability.",
            "To have a fast connection between different partners in the network.",
            "Kim.",
            "Finally, before I head over to its Joseph, I just want to go to show 1 slide about demand capacity, planning, collaborative demand, capacity planning and the situation we had in the past and we have at the moment so.",
            "As you see here we had last year the Market Volume in the automotive industry, but also in many other industries was going down so the information flow, let's say from the clients to the suppliers in the whole chain.",
            "It was quite slow and the suppliers still produced without knowing that the demand of the of the market.",
            "Was reduced so they have a waste through overproduction.",
            "Now we are somewhere in in this area, so everybody is reducing capacity and coming to a situation where the capacity and the demands are matched together.",
            "But what will happen in the future in the future when the demands of the market will increase then we have another problem.",
            "It's we're losing cars, becausw capacities of the suppliers.",
            "Are not matched with increasing demand of the market.",
            "So information is needed and information is needed very fast in the whole supply chain, not only between two partners, we are also losing a lot of time within this supply chain from the OEM to the Tier 1.",
            "Then from the Tier 1 to the Tier 2 to Tier 3, and so on, and the idea of this project is on one hand to deliver information very fast and on the other.",
            "Hand is to deliver the information, have transparency for the supply chain for the total supply chain.",
            "And with this I would like to hand it over to Joseph.",
