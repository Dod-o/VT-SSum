            "To do this so.",

            "We should check what is going up on up the stream of the rivers that come to Ljubljana.",
            "Maybe we could even use surface water measurements like for the rivers and so on.",

            "Cool to take.",
            "I don't know some feature like groundwater level and if this feature is represented in quadratic form or cubic form or square root form somewhere you do this transformation and then you check it whether this correlates or and if it gives any new information to your model then there are land use anthropogenic features and so on.",
            "Another thing that we need to do is to better define our use cases.",
            "So now we have a general algorithm that just based on the weather can predict what will happen in groundwater.",
            "If we have a case like we want to know what will happen with groundwater in three days time, then we can apply this and once we apply this we can also use groundwater level itself as a feature from 3 days ago.",
            "Why is this important?",
            "One thing that we have found in our models is that at some point our models always failed and then we checked what happened and we found out that there was a severe draft in Ljubljana between 2011 and 2012 and what happened there is that water levels didn't go below some certain threshold.",
            "And our models learning from the weather there and they learned no change, so they failed.",
            "In all other cases.",
            "So and this is something new that we have found in this aquifer and it can be explored by the by the experts.",
            "So then there are of course other methods deep learning of course is something to go.",
            "And another thing is generalization of the models.",
            "So these data driven models, they are only valid for one data point.",
            "So where are we measuring groundwater only there they will be successful.",
            "We cannot generalize them to other.",
            "Other sensors we can do that with introducing some metadata like location, distance from River, I don't know geologic properties and so on.",
            "OK, and there are some other directions.",
            "So in water management like Mattina said before, we are expected to have new technology that would bring a lot of data in and we need to be able to process this data in a big data manner.",
            "So stream mining is one of the approaches to take there and we are working for that.",
            "On that we want also to implement a real time platform matejka shown that some of the work is already in place.",
            "We need to build on top of it and then there are these two.",
            "These two bullets, so once we have a model ready, why don't we look at the model itself?",
            "What does it tell us?",
            "How do these features correlate?",
            "What does this model predict that influenced the groundwater?",
            "The experts should check this and see if there is something new new insight.",
