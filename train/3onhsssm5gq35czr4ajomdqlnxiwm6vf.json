            "And there are a couple of notions here which I think are interesting to keep in mind whenever you try to do measurements with organic data.",
            "So the first notion of reliability is simply the Inter intra rater reliability.",
            "So that means that you show the same thing to the same person and you want to get the same answer twice.",
            "So for example, if we think about the flu scenario, you could imagine that you show to people the list of.",
            "Search queries a certain person set up and then you know you asked this person.",
            "Do you think that this person was sick?",
            "So just by looking at what the person searched for?",
            "So basically the search history?",
            "Right then you ask the person a couple of other things and later you come back to the person and ask again the same thing and you want to see whether you would get the same answer twice for the same rating twice.",
            "The second notion is the Inter rater reliability.",
            "So here you would now have a bunch of people and you would show them the same thing and you would see whether they all you know agree on the ratings.",
            "So again I could have just the search history of a person and I could ask 10 people, you know, do you think this person was sick during this.",
            "And all 10 people who give me a rating and in the best case you know they would perfectly agree?",
            "And the last the notion of reliability is test retest reliability.",
            "So here you basically you want to be able to repeat your test.",
            "So I do this test now and I measured the Inter rater reliability for example.",
            "But I want to be able to do the same thing a year later with different data and I want to be able to get similar results because otherwise apparently what I measured was, you know, an artifact which was well it during that year.",
            "But it's not something which is more stable.",
            "It's not something which I can suggest to the research community.",
            "That's how you can do it, and that's like an approach which works kind of overtime.",
            "Voice is more more stable than just something which you can do once.",
            "So a measurement can be very consistent and stable, but it can still be invalid, so that's also important, because you can always get the same results, but you cannot measure what you actually want to measure.",
            "So what do I mean by that?",
            "So measuring what you want to measure means Google wants to measure the number of flu cases.",
            "What can be measured was whether it's winter or not, turned out in the end, right?",
            "So they didn't measure what we want to measure, though it might be a very consistent and stable measurement.",
            "Though it turned out it was not stable, but anyway, so if you want to figure out whether the measurement is valid, the first thing you can look at is face validity, so that's the weakest notion of validity.",
            "So it's basically just assessing the possibility of your measurement.",
            "So for example, again, in the Google Flu case scenario, what we could do is we could take the most predictive search query terms for flu and then give it to people and maybe randomly intrude some words.",
            "And then we could ask people, could you identify the intruders?",
            "So those words which are not indicated for flu?",
            "If they are able to correctly identify the words which we mixed in, then that means that the rest was apparently really semantically cohesive and indicated for flu.",
            "If they remove some of our predictive search query terms, then probably our measurement is not so plausable to humans at least.",
            "Construct validity is concerned with theoretical expectations, so sometimes you're lucky and what you measure there is a theory behind it, so you have some theoretical expectations about your measurements, so I think for the blue case there is maybe no big theory behind it that you could imagine something like you know during winter or during specific months is there should be like higher number of cases and you could just see whether your measurement is in line with this theoretical expectations.",
            "So that would be a way to check construct validity.",
            "And finally, criterion based validity is probably the thing most people here are more familiar with, because it's the computer science approach.",
            "You would take an external criterion, so like the CDC number of cases and you would try to predict that, and then you know the predictive performance will tell you something about the validity.",
            "I think all these notions are actually important, and often people only look at the criteria based validity.",
            "But I think like you know, if you have the bigger picture and you think about the different notions of reliability and validity and what that means for your specific problem, you might be able to come up with different ways of evaluating actually, how good is my measurement?",
            "You know how well am I doing, and so you can kind of avoid these failures that you know you think you have a very good predictive system and like one year later other people are showing that it's not stable.",

        [
            "So to be fair enough, because people often use the Google Flu trend case as an example for big data is failing, right?",
            "So you can't use big data to predict many things, but to be honest, I mean I think the Google Flu trends System is an example where at the beginning someone took an over simplistic approach and that's why it failed.",

            "For someone having flu, because that could change overtime since we know that the system changes, people change and so on.",
            "And the second thing is the automatically remove seasonal terms.",
