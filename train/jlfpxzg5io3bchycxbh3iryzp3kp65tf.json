            "Let's build models.",
            "What's the problem?",
            "Well, there are number of challenges and I'm not going to go through all of them, but they're literally.",
            "Couple of 100 papers we've written in our lab which talks about all these, but we'll talk about some of them, namely the breakdown of assumptions.",
            "The fact that data is highly unbalanced, the cost of computational features.",
            "Incorporating domain knowledge in the fact that there is no objective ground truth.",
            "So let's start with the breakdown of assumptions.",
            "So how do you do this traditionally right?",
            "You want to take all the candidates.",
            "If this is a traditional classification job, you build up a feature vector and you'd want to predict the class label 101, meaning it's a lesion that I want the physician to look at potentially malignant 00, meaning it's something else.",
            "And you get a bunch of data.",
            "This is the traditional way you do it, and you use your favorite neural network, SVM, logistic regression, decision tree, whatever, and you would come up with a classifier.",
            "Well, there are a number of problems and let's talk about two of them.",
            "The first is the training.",
            "Samples are not independent, they come from the same patient.",
            "Or in some cases you know they come from Siemens machines or perhaps potentially other people's machines which may be inferior.",
            "Just kidding, just kidding.",
            "Maybe not anyway, and the goal in the traditional thing is let's maximize the classification accuracy over all candidates.",
            "Well, this is a problem.",
            "Well, let's first start with the fact that the training examples are correlated.",
            "They come from the same hospital from the same patient, in this case from the same breast in the same lesion.",
            "So you have multiple correlations across the data you have, and when you look at it across hospitals, they have different protocols for how they in this case would prep the patient, etc.",
            "So all these cause tremendous.",
            "Amounts of correlation in the data and of course the fact that candidates tend to be spatially cast clustered the same lesion may generate hundreds of candidates.",
            "The second thing, and this is sort of hard to understand took me awhile is that candidate level accuracy is not important.",
            "What we do is let's crank it up and get you 99.97 accuracy and it's completely unimportant.",
            "Becausw, sorry.",
            "As I said, several candidates point to the same lesion.",
            "And you will detect the lesion if you put one mark over there for the doctor to look at putting 10 marks, there will only irritate her right or him.",
            "And so if you've got overlapping candidates, it's fine.",
            "If you miss him.",
            "In fact, it's a good thing to miss him.",
            "Secondly, let's say I am a doctor and I have two women whom I'm going to look at and one has two lesions.",
            "And another has one lesion, right?",
            "I would much rather get if I was going to get two lesions, get one in each woman.",
            "Because now I know that I have to treat them rather than get the two separate lesions in the first woman, because now I mistakenly sent the second room in a way she comes back a year later.",
            "The cancers this large has spread to the lymph nodes and is inoperable at this point.",
            "So per lesion sensitivity is important and per.",
            "Spatial sensitivity is important, and so we need to figure out how to evaluate the performance metric we use to evaluate our system.",
            "So here's one way we did it and there are a number of papers, some of which I referenced about from my group.",
            "So we have the the way we find the ground truth is the radiologist goes in and mark solution.",
            "So we say OK, something really simple.",
            "All candidates which overlap with the radiologist mark are positive.",
            "All the rest are negative as shown over there, so the red marks are positive.",
            "And in single instance learning this is what we want to do.",
            "We want all the Reds to be ones and all the Blues to be zeros.",
            "Here we have a notion of a bag.",
            "A bag is simply a group of candidates and is sufficient to classify any one of them as positive.",
            "This is multiple instance learning, and of course what we did was we had to modify SVM and logistic regression for multiple instance learning because of the computation requirements, we couldn't do so and we have done so.",
            "And here are some of the results.",
            "The goal is to classify at least one positive candidate correctly and this sort of is an illustrative example.",
            "the Reds are all negative examples, the grades not Blues are positive examples, and the squares are one bag.",
            "The triangles are one bag in the diamonds or another, and this is a boundary you get if you single instance learning fuse.",
            "Multiple instance learning you get a different boundary, which is a far more accurate, far better representation.",
            "So what you need to do to classify to get accuracy on future cancers?",
            "Alright, great you do this.",
            "You have your wonderful hyperplane.",
            "You've done multiple instance learning.",
            "Along comes a patient, so we talk about correlation in the training data, but there's a second problem.",
            "This lot of correlation, the test data you're getting all the data, the hundreds of candidates from one patient.",
            "So how do you account for correlation during testing?",
            "So let's say you take a hyperplane and you applied and these are the candidates you have.",
            "And it turns out that you miss some of the positive candidates from lesion, one which is OK, the one below, but you misclassify some of the candidates and lesion too well.",
            "We've developed algorithms that now account for correlation during testing.",
            "You switched the boundary.",
            "And you change the decision boundary at Test time to take these correlations into account, and you now get a classification such as that.",
            "Nor does we still classified one of the outliers over there as positive.",
            "And that may or may not be from the same lesion.",
            "This is synthetic data, but here's.",
            "Here's an example from real data and that case of our lung cancer system and one of the item on the right is a lesion in the item.",
            "On the left is not, and if we used a traditional classifier we have classified some of the items in the left also is being positive.",
            "Now the system only classifieds.",
            "The samples on the right.",
            "OK.",
            "So now let's talk about incorporating domain knowledge so.",
            "So now this is an example of colon cancer and before so here are examples of polyps.",
            "Polyps are precancerous structures and colon cancers and extremely virulent disease.",
            "If it's once you get it, it spreads in about a year.",
            "It's pretty much fatal, but if it's got early before it gets cancerous or in the precancerous stage, even almost 99% chance of survival, so detecting it early is quickly is is fairly important.",
            "However, if you've seen pictures of the colon, the large intestine, you know they showed as a bumpy thing, and it is bumping in the inside and polyps are bumps, so you gotta find the right bumps among bumps.",
            "This is the problem.",
            "And of course, not all of them are bumps.",
            "You see, first, the traditional bumpy polyp, but then you have the po dunk elated polyp, which is a polyp on a stock, and you have a flat polyp, which is like a edge.",
            "And finding all these are important and similarly in lung cancer.",
            "Below you have different kinds of morphologies, so the goal here is well.",
            "Instead of treating all positives the same.",
            "How about we just do some sort of soft gating and we now try to classify each of the different types so we try to classify something as either.",
            "Let's see here.",
            "We are looking at size large polyps and small polyps.",
            "All small polyps tend to be bumps because they haven't grown.",
            "Large polyps tend to be something very different.",
            "They're different.",
            "Classifiers is just an example of taking different domain knowledge and injecting it, and again this causes a tremendous difference in the performance.",
            "What we talked about.",
            "Positive examples on how about domain knowledge were negative example.",
            "So let's take frequent errors and yet are examples of frequent errors and.",
            "Someone I don't know why, but that looks an awful lot like the polyp in the different picture, but it's actually still.",
            "Yep, in in the picture and that's what you gotta figure out is not Apollo.",
            "And you've got a fold, which happens, you know, when the patient turns in, the polyp forms over.",
            "You've got image artifacts, and then you've got a rectal probe.",
            "I'm not a pleasant thing, but it's in the it's in there.",
            "And when you do the exam and of course you don't want it, you look like an idiot.",
            "If your software finds hundreds of dancers on the rectal probe, so doesn't seem like a big deal, but that's enough to cause the doctor to say this.",
            "This is a piece of junk, so practicality you give that is negative examples.",
            "And then what we did was.",
            "We basically built a new kind of classifier polyhedrin classifier that was able to not just find a decision boundary, but find multiple decision boundaries between different types of positives and negatives.",
            "And use that to get a label.",
            "Right?",
            "So let's look at my time and see.",
            "Maybe one more.",
            "Forget it.",
            "So one of the other things you could do is, you could say, let's all features are not connect created equal, right?",
            "It may take a few seconds to evaluate a few nanoseconds to evaluate one feature where another feature may involve minutes of computation.",
            "So you don't necessarily want to collect.",
            "All the features because you basically have about a minute to complete your classification, your feature extraction classification.",
            "So our first start was, well, let's build a cascaded classifier.",
            "Let's take all the candidates, computer few cheap features, throw some out and a smaller number compute, compute more expensive features and basically have a cascade.",
            "And we did that.",
            "And in fact that did pretty well.",
