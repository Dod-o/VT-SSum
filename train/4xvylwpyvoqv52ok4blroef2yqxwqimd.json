            "Yeah, thank you laughing, we've been there.",

            "It perform better than me, but I still want an explanation because if the patient came said like why did you give me this treatment?",
            "I can explain why the machine learning model like why did you give why did you recommend this treatment and they could?",
            "Well yeah, but it's the problem is with the medical fields like we need and it's great because I think.",
