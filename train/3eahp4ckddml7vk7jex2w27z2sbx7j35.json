            "It is something they need to have information about, and just looking at the tool I am was thinking.",

            "One of the things I was looking at, as well as the fact that you don't mention or we are, but we go to the principles behind, for we are even make it stronger on that point.",
            "So that's just let's say very very initial feedback on it.",
            "And I was thinking this would actually strengthen your case towards accreditation agencies and a lot of the time you did ask me for something controversial though.",

            "But we already have a system for tracking and using the resources in the scientific community.",

            "Most institutions don't have a way to track that or just say.",
            "Congratulations for being more efficient or policy is to say we expect you to be more efficient by using those resources.",
            "So let's say I would say the next step of measuring if you're going to go there would be that unless we create these real incentive schemes, that's what we're going to need to really mainstream this.",

            "Is this idea that in K through 12?",
            "Because we're so passionate about it, we are a lot of times we search for a problem that it will solve partially.",
            "I think the reason we do this is the fact that the idea of working openly is so germane to.",
            "Education, it just seems so obvious that that's what we want.",
            "It's obviously connected to constructive is Progressivist ideas of education that we're always constantly going back to that we feel that if you go to an educator in especially indicator 12 school and you say, hey, let's collaborate, let's share, can we all work together though?",
            "Yeah, that's what that's what I'd like to do.",
            "That's what I want to do when you actually get into the structure of how schools operate.",
            "Things are very different, and so you're actually asking them something that they probably want to do everyday anyway.",
            "With or without we are.",
            "But they can't do because of the structure that they're in, so it just adds injury to the insult.",
            "It makes it more complicated because you're just providing them more things to do now in the form of a label called ovr, and they'll never be able to push forward.",
            "Now in higher education and one of the things that we still bet on is this idea that people have a lot more flexibility now doesn't mean that we have all these guidelines that talk about rewards and recognition and all these structures are needed policy.",
            "They need to be in place, but I think in higher education we have a chance of doing this better because people have a lot more resources and flexibility than they do in basic education.",
            "Now, once you put these things in place, you can expect things to move forward, and one of the things we're doing is in teacher education.",

            "We did that last year so we took a percent of size that produced in one hour and it took 50 hours to do the cleaning of the set.",

            "This is probably the most complicated question on Earth, because when we started this we started from the point of view that the higher you are in the in the scale, the batteries for the ecosystem so that we are biased in the sense that we believe that more open educators would be better for the system for the school, for the Universe, no one can question this in the sense that more open indicator might be simply more expensive might be not be talking about systems which I've constrained, so not we're not in a perfect world, so we have not.",
            "Ask the teachers where they want to be because we believe most of them would tend to like to be more open mainly because of.",
            "Before doing this, we are they're supposed to read a few things that should convince them on why they should get open.",
            "But having said this, we run a few very informal focus group with a few teachers from Politecnico Torino trying to understand.",
            "There are some groups.",
            "For example the open designer.",
            "So I was if I.",
            "If I if I have to tell you before that seven people are designing their courses fully online by putting this stuff online and they do it, you know in engineering terms, software engineering they do this online and they they share it.",

            "So of course the caveat.",
            "The starting caveat is that this is for teachers and for educational leaders who have an interest or motivation for their institution or their career to get more open.",

            "They always come with the same obstacle.",
            "The challenge for them is that they want to be and to keep being a very good, excellent teacher committed to their students.",
            "But the Union, the policy, the administration they Institute, or the school or there are many things there that are all of them.",
            "Logistic things, usually because they have if they want to be better they have to double the timeline calling set because I have to run my usual 40 hour.",
            "But then every week plus 10 more if I want to do an additional extra workshop for the school for the parents of or whatever if I want to open is as a compliment to the formal learning, not as a replacement to the formal, and this is the case.",
            "So the point useful is a time based problem that I want to have 40 hours, no 80 hours to the teacher so they can be fresh for teaching and not just an issue.",
            "And all.",
