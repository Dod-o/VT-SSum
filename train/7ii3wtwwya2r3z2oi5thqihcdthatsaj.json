            "Thank you, and so obviously there are very small and a little bit of dust could do some damage, so I'd like you to simulate a piece of dust and just choose one of them.",
            "And turn it upside down.",
            "OK, so I'm going to look away.",
            "Magic trick you choose one and turn it upside down.",
            "OK is went upside down.",
            "Right now I need to read your mind and try and work out what it is and of course look at this and I can sort of say, well I think the one that's upside down is that one there.",
            "I've got the right one, OK now.",
            "For me 2526 years ago, that was one of those amazing moments where the five year olds in the class went well.",

            "I thought it's just computer science, but computer science is kind of magic.",

            "I would probably say I don't believe you and if you said you watch videos on it, it's like impossible, right?",
            "It's magic, and it is kind of magic and one of the things about a device like this is if I wanted to look inside it then my warranty would be void.",
            "OK, so I'm not allowed to look inside it.",
            "Well I could, but it's a one way trip so.",
            "In some ways the manufacturer saying this is magic.",
            "Don't look inside, trust us, it will do all the magic things for you, and So what we're doing with teaching computer science is kind of removing some of the measure.",
            "Can going.",
            "Maybe you could understand this and then we put extra magic in and go.",
            "But actually it is sort of magic.",
            "What we can do because their ideas there are really fascinating.",
            "So of course what we do is everyone wants to know how to do it with children.",
            "Often I'd say who wants to know how to do it.",
            "Every hand goes up and they go, not telling you.",
            "Until the end of the class.",
            "And that's a really good way to keep peoples attention, but I'll do this well now.",
            "'cause I now that I'm getting older, I keep forgetting to do it at the end of the class.",
            "Actually, the children remind me.",
            "So what we do is take quite a constructive IST approach and so essentially I'll try and get as much of it from you were doing it.",
            "Fairly fast here and we don't have real children, but we just say how many black ones are there in the first line.",
            "For now, with five year olds with actually 123.",
            "OK, so you know this.",
            "And in the next line.",
            "For.",
            "Four, and as I did, you put two and four on every line.",
            "Well know, and then we discover every column also has two and four or six.",
            "So what's special about the numbers 2, four and six?",
            "And of course, the students will fairly quickly workout that they are even numbers.",
            "So did you put an even number in every line, and child will go?",
            "I didn't try to.",
            "Yeah.",
            "What are the chances of that and so at that point what we can do is say, well, some of the children may realize or hang on you.",
            "Put an extra 1 there.",
            "And so if I take away some of the extra ones.",
            "We would say, well, there are three black ones there.",
            "If I want it to be an even number, what color do I put here?",
            "Click OK if I want this to be an even number I put.",
            "Why is that one?",
            "White and this one.",
            "Click and so on, and I did that for every row and column, but I get the children to explain it because they don't need to know how this works really, but they need to know that they could work it out.",
            "That's the important thing, so they're constructing the knowledge in their mind and so now with your newly gained information, I say, could you please look away and I'll turn one over.",
            "It's a little scary, even if you know what's happening.",
            "So between that one over OK, you can look around by the way we need when I turn away I always say is 1 turned over because sometimes the child will turn over 2, right?",
            "You picked the wrong child.",
            "But there will always be someone in the classroom.",
            "He goes.",
            "She turned over to you.",
            "OK, so if you say his bun turned over OK, so one of these is turned over.",
            "Now again, to avoid embarrassment I'm going to scaffold us.",
            "So basically.",
            "I know you know, and that's the truth.",
            "This is the trouble with adults is that they know, right?",
            "You think you think yeah, so?",
            "And by the way, some children will see the thing straight away, maybe not 5 year olds, but so anything wrong on this road.",
            "Is this row OK?",
            "OK, so this is something wrong in here and then there's this one.",
            "OK, this one.",
            "OK this one.",
            "OK, so there's something wrong in there and.",
            "Nearly all the time, the child can figure out which one is wrong from that, so feel free to put it right and go down.",
            "Thank you very much.",
            "Now, as it happens, you've set up a very nice example because to me you have to relate it to what's happening in the real world.",
            "How does this affect our lives?",
            "Well, one way to fix your life is that we have one of these up here, and if I hold this up.",
            "Then I'll turn the sound on.",
            "Then it actually reads those binary digits OK.",
            "But I can be a simulated piece of dust.",
            "Sorry bout this.",
            "And I'll change one of the white ones to black.",
            "And now.",
            "What will happen?",
            "Will it take me to the right place?",
            "Still goes to the same place, but suppose someone snuck in here today and they put one there and there and there.",
            "Well at work.",
            "Yeah, still works.",
            "In actual fact, there's a lot of bits here dedicated to error correction, in fact.",
            "Let's see if that works.",
            "Oh, OK. OK, so it did a bit more computation.",
            "It was a little harder, but it can still read it.",
            "OK. Maybe now it's too much OK?",
            "Sorry.",
            "So it's about.",
            "Yeah, of course you can generate these.",
            "You could put your own message on them and it is quite interesting where that boundary is, how many bits you can eliminate or change color of.",

            "What happens if I change 2 bits?",
            "Do you know that there's an error?",
            "And by the way, when I read that it didn't give me the wrong value, it just said can't read it right?",
            "So it could detect that there was an error and it could even correct the error and so we can talk about error detection, error correction.",
            "What's the difference?",
            "In what scenarios does they have?",
            "Do they happen?",
            "And the answer is pretty much any data at all has error correction added to it.",
            "This is very visible data, but whether it's on a CD or a hard disk, or it's transmitted, there is error correction and error detection.",
            "Edit, which is why you don't often open a file in, it just has the wrong information in it.",
