        ],
        [
            "So I'd like to start by really putting a bit of context and say which problem I'm working on from the biological side and why this is an important problem.",
            "I think that obviously here the focus is on the machine learning side and my background is engineering and applied mathematics.",
            "But when you start digging into a bed, ikle orebaugh, gicle problem, then I think it gets really important to find an interesting, exciting problem, either from a scientific perspective or from an application perspective.",
            "In my case, this is diagnosis of a rare genetic disease, so.",
            "Basically what you have is that about 5% of the population is affected by rare genetic disorders.",
            "That seems like a small number if you compare that with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or cancer.",
            "At the same time, it's quite an important medical problem because the cost of rare disease is very high.",
            "Every patient who survives after birth will incur major costs, you know.",
            "Imagine somebody who lives in an institution for all their lives who need special education.",
            "For for about 18 years of their life, who needs constant medical treatments or?",
            "Follow up the impact on the family is the fact that parents need to stay home to take care of their kids.",
            "The cost of a single patient is absolutely massive, so when you actually factor that in the total burden, the Society of rare genetic diseases is actually come parable to that of the major diseases.",
            "The difficulty is that there's only a few patients with each of those diseases, but there are many of them.",
            "There's about 7000 recognized disease entities, but with frequencies in less than one in 2000.",
            "Usually the the line that we draw to decide that something is rare one in 2000 infected individual, often one in 10 thousand 100,000 even a few patients worldwide so.",
            "At first you could.",
            "You could be very discouraged and say, well, you know what can you do for all these patients.",
            "We're not going to develop treatments for them, but giving good diagnosis and I'll give a case is very important.",
            "And if we can give this good diagnosis, we can really do something for the patient, but also for their families.",
            "So rare genetic diseases is a big burden to families as a whole and they are enduring some psychological harm because of not knowing what's going on with their child.",
            "So the first goal is really a clinical goal, so we actually develop prototypes of new technologies.",
            "In the past.",
            "It's been a really comparative genomic hybridization since the last.",
            "Couple of years.",
            "It's exome sequencing and we want to bring these technologies into the clinic and I'll give an example of what we can do with these technology to actually improve the diagnosis of patients.",
            "So the first goal is bring these new technologies into the clinic while the geneticists will put the machines, they'll start running their samples, produce a lot of data, and say, well, you know, what do I do with this data?",
            "What does it mean?",
            "How do I interpret it correctly so this is our first goal improve?",
            "Diagnosis in the case of array CGH here, it's actually two map regions of the genome that are linked to some genetic disorders.",
            "The second goal is actually to do.",
            "Biology, so basically what we do is we use our patients as the model systems to understand human biology.",
            "So what you can do in mouses you can take a mouse you can knock down a gene and see what happens.",
            "You can do the same thing in fruit fly very efficiently in humans.",
            "We can just knock Gene and see what happens.",
            "We can go to the hospital and collect those patients and actually try to understand which genes are affected by mutations.",
            "Here, deletions or duplications of genome.",
            "And see which genes are causative for the disease and what consequences that has on human biology.",
            "So the problem we have is that we collect a bunch of patients and we don't know for sure.",
            "You know we have not identified the causative mutation.",
            "We don't really know where where the cause exactly is.",
            "Imagine doing G was studies and having like a grey zone with a bunch of jeans that look suspicious.",
            "But you're not quite sure if you in that field and we try to identify regions in the genome, correlate that with phenotypes and say well here.",
            "I have what we call a critical region.",
            "So for example if I take seizures to simplify the problem, I have three out of four patients that have seizures with an anomaly in that region, and actually they share that region.",
            "All three of them, and not with the 4th, and so you might want to infer if I simplify the problem that there must be a gene in this region whose mutation causes seizures.",
            "Now there is a story about penetrance and things like that.",
            "It's not that simple, but it's a general idea.",
            "Now, in this region you might have.",
            "One gene, then you're done, but more often you'll have 10:50, a couple 100 genes, and then the question is, which one of those jeans do I want to go and validate further?",
            "OK, so this is the problem we look at is actually trying to identify try to clone, try to map the disease causing gene.",
            "Either this is the gold standard by actually taking patients that don't have the same type of anomaly.",
            "So here the patients that do not have deletions in that region but do actually have the symptoms and find.",
            "Whether any of those patients carries a mutation in our disease genes or the bronze standard is to actually go and mutate that gene in an animal model and see whether we see an effect on that.",
            "So human geneticists really make a difference between the Golden the bronze standard.",
            "If you don't have a bunch of patients with mutation in the gene, they are always very suspicious.",
            "So when you want to make a clinical diagnosis, you need be quite sure about.",
            "What the significance of a particular gene is?",
            "I mean, it's not because the mutation in mouse leads to certain phenotype that you get exactly the same consequence.",
            "In human, we're not exactly mice after all.",
            "And so this is quite important from Human Genetics is because you actually have a clinical application, so that's where the gold standard is.",
            "Other mutation mutations in other patients.",
            "So here we actually understand find genes, mutation, cause disease.",
            "And we actually annotate them very deeply.",
            "So the advantage here is that we're not just saying this gene is an enzyme or this gene is an enzyme in that particular molecular cascade, or this gene is an enzyme.",
            "That particular molecular cascade implicated in that particular development process.",
            "Now we're saying.",
            "When you mutate this gene, you get that consequence.",
            "For example, a cardiac defect during heart development at that week in development, you get the exact function you know this gene causes exactly that consequence in human functionally at the deepest biological level, so that makes these rare diseases a fantastic model for studying human biology.",
            "And actually, when you trace down many genes that have been studied very deeply, into which.",
            "Pathway they belong to usually the first gene in a particular cascade.",
            "They have been found by this kind of study, so there's actually delivered about 2000 genes with deep annotations in the human genome."
        ],
        [
            "Now I will not focus on the clinical problem, but I want to go back and discuss that a little bit further or why this is an important medical problem.",
            "So basically, the first thing you tend to think when you look at these disorders is say OK, I found the mutation.",
            "Now what do I do with my patient with treatment?",
            "Do I give my patient and then my answer is often, well, you know, except for a few metabolic disorders for which you can do something.",
            "For example by changing the dietze, avoiding the accumulation of a certain metabolites in the body.",
            "For example, most of the times you don't have much of good treatments, so often you do supportive treatments.",
            "But really curing these region diseases for the moment, that's not quite possible.",
            "Maybe in a few years gene therapy is making comeback.",
            "Maybe will make big progress there, but in terms of therapy, this is quite limited.",
            "So the first reaction might be gentle to your hands in the air and say, well, what does it matter to know what the cause of the disease is?",
            "If you cannot do anything about it anyway?",
            "Well, basically I said there is the patient, but there is also the family so.",
            "When you don't know what's wrong with your kid, then you cannot just say well something is wrong with my kid, an well it will have some cause or another and I'll just have to accept it as is.",
            "Psychologically very, very difficult.",
            "So what happens is that parents go with their kids from one hospital to the next.",
            "The average time for diagnosis, and this is the average is 5 to 7 years.",
            "OK, so to get the correct diagnosis you'll just bounce back from one place to the other.",
            "Undergo medical procedures.",
            "And it will take an average 5 to 7.",
            "This is an average.",
            "The tail is very long, OK, currently about 40% of the patients still never get diagnosed.",
            "It's not rare to have diagnosis after 20 years.",
            "You can find quite a few cases.",
            "So during all these years these people will get discouraged.",
            "This stop going.",
            "Then they'll go back.",
            "The doctor will call them back and said maybe we have an idea.",
            "Will try something different and so the cost of this diagnosis is very, very high and that's what we call the diagnostic.",
            "Obviously so finally you get an answer and then when you have this answer.",
            "Well, first of all, the answer might simply be it's a genetic defect.",
            "OK, if it's a genetic defect, well, it's not your fault.",
            "OK, so the major cost of intellectual disability.",
            "The most frequent one is is fetal alcohol syndrome.",
            "OK, so when you have a kid with intellectual disability, typically mothers will say, well, you know, did I drink too much before I knew I was pregnant?",
            "Was that that drink ahead of Christmas that made up my kid is handicapped.",
            "This is a lot of pressure on people.",
            "I mean, it's something that you carry during years and years and years.",
            "If you can say this is a genetic defect, then you can say, well, this is not the cause an you know you didn't do anything wrong during early pregnancy.",
            "That's a very heavy psychological burden you can remove from people if you can.",
            "In fairness, tell them well this is the explanation.",
            "So the if you know it's a genetic defect then you can get it and you know which one it is.",
            "Then you can have a genetic model you can know whether this is something the Novo that happy aired only in the kid and there is nothing similar in the parents.",
            "You can know if it's a recessive or dominant disease and then you can have an idea of the risk for the next pregnancy, because in those families parents will often want to have another child.",
            "They don't like to stay on this loss of, you know, having a child with severe problems.",
            "So if you know the diagnosis then you can say well.",
            "Is it safe to have another pregnancy or do you need to go through IVF procedures to try to avoid that the genius propagated to the next child?",
            "I mean, what you don't want is to get another child with the same disease when you already have one.",
            "Then the another important goal is to predict disease progression and life expectancy.",
            "So the life expectancy of patients with rare genetic disorder varies very widely.",
            "You know, for example, now if you take Down syndrome, we don't have any treatment for Down syndrome.",
            "We can't cure Down syndrome.",
            "However, we have quite good supportive treatments for Down syndrome and life expectancy of patients with Down syndrome is now over 50 years, maybe going to 60 years now.",
            "This is really quite long, so that means that the parents by that time.",
            "Often women over 30 if Down syndrome by the time their child is 50, these people, the parents will be really quite old and so they need to worry what will happen to my child if if I'm dead before my child.",
            "OK, this is a very strange perspective, but that's when you have to adjust to a few apparent with a child with rare genetic disease the opposite, you can have a 2 year old child who's doing quite badly, but as he going down Elano that well, actually within two years we have to expect that your child will be dead.",
            "So you really need to adjust to these things that are very important, so you cannot just say oh, it's just diagnosis, so it's not important, right?",
            "And hopefully in the future will go and work more and more on treatments one way or another.",
            "Now what can you do with diagnosis in a good case, this is quite a nice example.",
            "Usually it's just reporting diagnosis.",
            "Sometimes you can go further and I want to illustrate that here this is a patient that's seen at the hospital at the genetics clinic and this patient shows a number of symptoms that point at a potential defect in the genome.",
            "So a combination of symptoms, combination of phenotypes that tend to indicate that there might be actually a deletion or duplication the genome.",
            "They actually is checked with an array that's built to look at loci across the genomes, and it finds a deletion in chromosome.",
            "22"

        [
            "And if you look at that deletion on chromosome 22, it's 800 KB deletion.",
            "And when the geneticist looks at the deletion.",
            "They actually look at the deletion say, OK, it's probably causative, but wait.",
            "This deletion covers a gene called NF 2.",
            "And then if two is known to their patients with mutations in F2, they carry a benign tumor of the acoustic nerve called acoustic neurinoma.",
            "And this tumor is benign.",
            "But it's hard to diagnose because it's inside the head and leads to very severe complications, so a deafness, facial paralysis, and possibly death.",
            "So basically when the patient is seen and that you understand what the jeans are and what their implication of those jeans are, you realize, wait, wait, wait, you have mutation in F2.",
            "Our deletions in this case."
        ],
        [
            "Case and we have not reported anything about the acoustic neuromas here.",
            "I mean, this is something you wouldn't see at first.",

            "Otherwise the child can have later on severe complications.",
            "Nobody understands what's going on.",
            "Why is that happening?",

            "Now this is with the older technology, or HGH.",
            "Now the big change now is sequencing.",

            "If you look at the reality in the in the clinic.",
            "Happening right now is that we don't sequence the whole genome of patients, yet it's too.",
            "It's too expensive, even if it's not that expensive.",
            "You know about 3 three to 5000 euros.",
            "However, you often have to the patients and their two parents, so multiply that by three is still a bit on the high side anyway.",
            "If you sequence the whole genome, well, you'll have the problem of interpreting what's not in the coding regions of the genome.",
            "So for the moment what's coming up very strongly is exome sequencing.",

            "About 3% of the genome, so you reduce the cost by a factor 30.",
            "Then, because you have to finish this part of DNA while you increase the cost back, but.",
            "For about 500 Euro 2000 Euro you can sequence the coding part.",
            "The protein coding part of the genome and that is now entering routine clinical use.",

            "Have already sequence a few thousand patients.",
            "It's easier to interpret, but the question there is not just which genes caused the disease, but actually which specific mutations in the gene cause the disease.",
            "And that's what I will talk about in the second part of the talk.",
            "There is still a big gap in terms of the tools that we have available for this problem and how we can use them to predict which mutations are."

            "Uh, it resided anymore large parts of the genome, zarte completely homozygous, and so if you have a mutation at one place actually the second copy in the genome will carry exactly the same mutation because that second copy was is actually coming back to the same ancestor back in time because the Grand Grand Grand Grand Father on Father Side an another on Mother side are actually identical essentially or more grandmother.",

            "That are so, and these are likely to contain the disease causing gene and the disease causing mutations.",

            "I find the homozygous regions I find 4 strongly homozygous region I then look which variants which mutations are present in those I only keep the ones that are more likely to be positive because they are not already in database of frequent variance for example and I'm down to 15 genes containing mutations that can cause the.",
