            "Time stems on IoT data need not be unique, so they might not be a primary key column.",

            "Why?",
            "It's because in my lab I work with a lot of people who are not trained in RDF as well, and it's difficult for them to understand art OML, so this mapping is slightly simpler in the sense that it very directly models the ontology.",

            "You are able to.",
            "It just replaces literals with bindings, so it's.",
            "Easier for them to understand an it's compatible with Arthur ML because it can be translated to and fro, but as you say, there are some extra things that can't be translated, so that's.",
