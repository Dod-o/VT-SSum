            "It's also a great pleasure to actually announce that.",
            "The event you are attending is the biggest scientific event on computational creativity.",
            "This year we have over 60 registrations plus 10 speakers here.",
            "So seven people all together and we're very proud of that.",
            "Of course I hope, and I believe I'll be very proud of the program.",
            "Also afterwards.",
            "At least now looking at the program, the topics, the speakers.",
            "I'm very excited myself about the week and how it's.",
            "Going to be.",
            "This event is currently sponsored and organized by Pro Seco.",
            "The network to promote computational creativity, I will shortly invite Tony.",
            "We'll talk more about that.",
            "The organizers otherwise are the University of Helsinki.",
            "Here, this is not Helsinki as you may have noticed.",
            "This also that University of Helsinki here.",
            "But actually we we picked this location here in portable becausw it's small enough and spooky enough and there's nothing else to do, so no attractions outside this room here.",
            "The competition is limited.",
            "I'd also kindly like to acknowledge the financial support that we have from 2:50 PhD programs, one on computational Sciences and the other one on computer science.",
            "In more general, they are currently providing some support for the auditorium here and.",
            "And some of the events we will have.",
            "Next, I'd like to invite Tony to give a brief introduction of Prosecco.",
            "That's the network that is funding many of the participants here actually directly by paying your registration fees and your accommodation and meals.",
            "And at the same time I've been like 222 to actually give up this introduction to Prosecco.",
            "Also, an introduction to computational creativity.",
            "So welcome again and Tony please.",
            "I'm delighted to be here and I'm delighted that you're all here.",
            "It's a great early sign for the success of Pro Seco.",
            "And before I mentioned briefly what Pro Seco is and the origins per seco, I'd like us all and I'm sure we'll do this properly in a week.",
            "But let's start a week by giving a round of applause to Hannah and his team for putting together what looks like a very, very exciting week.",
            "How do is done this before and he makes it look easy, but there's actually a lot of work that goes into organizing this, and we're very lucky to have him as part of Pro Seco Network now.",
            "Pro seco.",
            "Funny name.",
            "I suppose I should start by telling you what the name came from.",
            "We were a bunch of us were reviewing creativity projects for the European Union and complaining about the quality of the projects and while they weren't picking any of our projects, we then notice that we haven't submitted any projects.",
            "But that was still the EU's fault.",
            "We're having dinner.",
            "And whenever you have dinner with salmon and.",
            "Whether or not someone is paying for it, Simon always orders the expensive wine and many bottles of wine and everybody at the table was thinking why doesn't pick a cheap wine?",
            "And then when we said what's going to be the name of our coordination action?",
            "We were all lexically prime, but a concept cheap wine and Prosecco pop that he said OK, what can pro seco mean?",
            "There's two sees in their computational creativity.",
            "Actually it was still around.",
            "We were looking for a word with two season Pro Seco prime budget requests for cheap wine came alive.",
            "Now what is the purpose of Pro Seco?",
            "The coordination action it is to put computational creativity on the map.",
            "It's a topic that many people have approached in their work in psychology or machine learning or AI.",
            "And have.",
            "Used a folk notion of what computational creativity is and the purpose of the coordination action is to solidify and mature this concept so that it's no longer full concept but a real discipline with founding principles.",
            "With Canonical literature with accepted practices, precedence, standards of evaluation, yearly conferences, then used for publication.",
            "All of the things that make a real field.",
            "That we can move from being a warm and fuzzy ideal to being a real scientific approach to the study of creativity.",
            "Now there are many issues with docs, which is why we need a coordination action and that's why Pro SECO exists.",
            "And we're off to a great start looking around the audience here.",
            "There's not a familiar faces here and a lot of unfamiliar faces, which is exactly the point of Pro Seco because by the end of the week you will all be familiar faces and will be an even bigger army to go out into the world and indoctrinate.",
            "Others will edit the word indoctrinate later.",
            "We replace it with something from Asaurus, but that's the goal right?",
            "To promote this idea that computers can be creative.",
            "In reality, or in simulation, to the point that the differences don't really matter, we're going to have a lot of exciting debate along the way about the distinction between human and machine creativity.",
            "Is there one?",
            "Do we need to understand human psychology to understand machine creativity?",
            "That's a heated issue.",
            "There will be some Sparks flying at various stages.",
            "Alright, I want to encourage everybody to get in on the debate.",
            "OK, this is an autumn school.",
            "But it is.",
            "A school in the old Greek sense of a big aghora where everybody is to pitch in and share their ideas.",
            "And if you feel that someone is talking nonsense, call them out on it.",
            "OK, no one is going to bite your head off.",
            "We all welcome a good old Barney.",
            "We have them all the time, so if someone is saying something words in profound.",
            "And you shout out.",
            "What nonsense that would be an entirely welcome interjection in the in the way of Pro Seco.",
            "Because we're all about creating debate and that is exactly what creativity is about.",
            "Creativity, in essence, is avoiding convention and avoiding convergence results sake.",
            "Divergences to be welcomed.",
            "OK, so at the end of the week, if we don't all agree on what creativity is or what to do next, that is an entirely healthy state of affairs, provided that we're not paralyzed by indecision at the end of the week, we want everybody supercharge to go off and to work in computational creativity as a discipline.",
            "Which means designing and building systems that exhibit some vague shadow of creativity and the seeds of future awesomeness.",
            "OK, not much awesomeness on display this week, I think, but.",
            "This is because we're at the birth of the fields in 10 years time.",
            "You look back and you say the awesomeness we see now and take for granted.",
            "It was born 10 years ago in inauspicious circumstances in the town where there was nothing else to do.",
            "Because that's.",
            "How new organized it?",
            "Along way honey organized events like this.",
            "OK, so, welcome everybody, we're delighted to have you.",
            "And we hope, by the way, that this is the beginning of a long term engagement with the fields.",
            "So we have yearly conferences on this topic.",
            "Our flagship conference is the International Conference on Computational Creativity, and you're all.",
            "Strongly encouraged to submit your work.",
            "Come to the conference and become an active member of this field.",
            "We would be delighted to have you and we hope to see a lot more of you after this school.",
            "But for now, let's get this school started."
