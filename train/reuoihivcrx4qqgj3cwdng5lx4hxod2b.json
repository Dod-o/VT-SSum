            "The approach right?",

            "How do you can check and maintain this information instruction and integration program efficiently?",
            "Overtime right, the second set of challenges is how do you do the user feedback in an efficient fashion and that is actually pretty fascinating and I'm going to talk about that later then the test set obviously is.",

            "OK, so now the key observation here is when you blow industrial strength information instruction, an intervention program on the web, you actually cannot just use individual information instruction and integration black boxes.",

            "When you blow a real system running on the web, you need to combine multiple black boxes together into a workflow and this black boxes you either develop in house or you can acquire from somewhere on the web or you buy this thing.",
            "So you have multiple black boxes and the key thing is how do you combine these things?",
            "OK and they actually have been a lot of different choices out there on how to do this.",
            "One way to do this is using the Weimar framework that was developed at IBM for example.",
            "It will allow you to essentially about the output of the black box into the input at the other black box.",
            "That kind of thing and the other one you could do is using the publish subscribe model an.",
            "There are many other possible choices.",
            "Again, here, what do you want to do is in one some way to combine that would be very easy to write, understand, debug and maintain.",
            "It needs to be fairly expressive.",
            "It should be able to do loop.",
            "It should be able to do recursion because that is quite pervasive.",
            "Instruction and integration.",
            "OK, it also had solid theoretical theoretical foundation, so you know what you are doing and the most critical thing of all is you must have a way to optimize this.",

            "I was told I'm stuck.",
            "OK baby life example the unoptimized version could easily take two days to run and if we try to refresh data every single day we don't have to lie to spare.",
            "So we really need to optimize.",
            "And what I have found with my student is about 60% of our time when into optimization.",
            "Essentially this didn't.",

            "OK, now it will be in a fairly naive fashion, is going to take hours or days easily.",
            "So right then and there that took us like a another tool to optimize.",
            "So obviously in one system where you could just drive, but I want to be 4040 thousand regular, especially over 10,000 text document and everything should be done easily.",
            "Write another example would be running a macro logic network to extract person name for that, even if you have just a toy setting, it could already take your hours.",

            "OK, so that is you job now you could try a bunch it per script to do the instruction going from here to here.",

            "OK, so this look like a Datalog program, and it has three rules.",
            "The first rule essentially say that you know you start with the documents in the document is thought in the table, and then you cannot run a procedure Co each truck title.",
            "Over the documents and you gonna pull out the title.",
            "OK and the procedure is written as a pro model and those title is going to be stored together with the document ID in this table title right over here.",
            "OK, let me do the same thing and you're going to pull out the abstract and you put them over here and then you take the table title table abstract you're going to join them and then you gonna run the procedure to obtain only the pair of title and.",
            "Stuck where the title is right before the abstract.",
            "OK and finally you look at only the abstract that contained the phrase relevance feedbacks and those is going to be returned as a table of talks over here.",
            "So if you look at this whole thing, it looks like a little program.",
            "Let's set temp radically over here.",
            "I'm not a table, it is really a procedure apiece of code.",
            "OK, then I'm able to look at this is that you have a bunch of black boxes.",
            "Knows that the right one and you combine them using later.",
            "Like a rules.",
            "OK, so once you obtain a program like this then you could just give the program to our system and our system will automatically compile and optimize and run in the most efficient fashion, yes.",
            "Doesn't that can pull some requirements on the procedures?",
            "So if you're going to do some whole setup to the nation, it did take a lock program?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Bye bye.",
            "Yes, so yeah, absolutely right.",
            "We do have to have certain condition imposed on the black boxes and the conditioner fairly light in a paper related to this.",

            "I essentially just tried to gloss over those issues.",

            "You could compile it into a workflow like this, so as you can see you have the document at the bottom.",

            "Basically relational operator like adjoining and selection and grouping and aggregation and that kind of thing.",
