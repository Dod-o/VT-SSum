            "So in this example, the class is movie and the named entities are moved movie titles.",

            "Suppose the user inputs a query like beautiful mind.",
            "So if this search engine can identify beautiful mind is a movie title, it may customize its ranking function and provide more movie related pages.",

            "First challenge is to choose a suitable data source.",
            "So in this paper they also propose to use clickthrough data as the data source for named entity mining.",
            "Um?",
            "The second challenge is that as we will see later, named entities are often ambiguous, so we have to address the ambiguity issue.",

            "So to address this challenge, the authors propose a novel approach called weakly supervised learning for LDA.",

        [
            "See more details.",
            "First, let's look at clickthrough data.",
            "So clicks off data are derived from search engine logs.",
            "So basically we can think of clickthrough data as topples of query.",
            "Click size and frequency.",
            "So in click through data for each query we are record the whole set of sites which were clicked as answers to these queries and at the same time we also record the click frequency for the corresponding sites.",
            "So in the paper, the authors claim that there are at least three advantages to use clickthrough data as the data source for named entity mining.",
            "First they found that over 30% of queries contain the entities.",
            "That means our click through data contain rich knowledge for named entity mining.",
            "The second reason is that crystal data also provides rich context for determining the classes of entities.",
            "So here we have two types of Contacts.",
            "The first one is called query context for example.",
            "Movie titles often appear together with the world trailer inquiries.",
            "Moreover, like game names often appear together with the word cheats inquiries.",
            "So in other words, these two words trailer and cheese can be considered as the characteristic context for movie titles and game names.",
            "So the other type of context is called click Contacts.",
            "For example for movie titles, users are likely to click on the sites such as imdb.com, while forgetting names users would like to click on sites of gamespot.com so we can see that both query context and click context can help us to determine the classes of entities.",
            "And the last reason is that kills data contains the wisdom of crowds, so we know that search engine logs grow every day, and a commercial search engine may receive billions of queries for each day.",
            "So and since.",
            "Search any logs grow every day.",
            "Click through data may help us to identify emerging named entities."
        ],
        [
            "Now let's look at Latent Dirichlet allocation.",
            "The reason why the author chose LDA is that named entities are often ambiguous.",
            "For example, Harry Potter may either refer to a book or a movie, or a game.",
            "So ideally we would like to classify Harry Potter to all those three classes, and even more ideally, we hope to learn a distribution of Harry Potter over these classes.",
            "So for this purpose, LDA is a natural choice and this figure shows the intuition behind this choice.",
            "So in this figure, the classes, movie and game represents two topics.",
            "And when the users consider Harry Potter as movie title, they would like to they are very likely to form formulate queries such as Harry Potter trailer, Harry Potter DVD and Click on sites such as imdb.com or movies.yahoo.com.",
            "On the other hand, when the users consider Harry Potter as game name, there probably will formulate queries such as Harry Potter cheese, Harry Potter game and click on this website.",
            "So we can see that we can model Harry Potter as a mixture over topics.",
            "And.",
            "Well, each topic would generate both query context and click context."
        ],
        [
            "So, so as we have seen that LDA is capable of describing the generation process of clickthrough data.",
            "However, it cannot be applied directly to the problem of named entity entity Mining.",
            "The reason is that classical LDA is unsupervised model.",
            "Consequently, the topics identified by LDA may not correspond well with the predefined classes of named entities.",
            "So completely unsupervised LDA is not applicable, however.",
            "On the other hand, completely supervised LDA may not be practical either.",
            "The reason is that human labels are often inaccurate and partial.",
            "First, human judges often give binary indicator rather than proportion.",
            "That means human just often only tells us whether named entity belongs to a class or not.",
            "So it is very hard for them to give us a distribution of a name entity over classes.",
            "The second reason is that human labels only indicate that a named entity belongs to assert to certain classes, but not exclude the possibility that it belongs to the other classes.",
            "That means the human labels often contain false negatives.",
            "OK, so to balance between a total a completely unsupervised model and a completely supervised LDA, the authors provide propose a new approach called weakly supervised LDA, which supervises LDA training with partial labels."

        [
            "OK, so here is the framework of the whole approach.",
            "So at the beginning the users are given set of seats as well as their classes and at the same time the authors are given a large scale clickthrough data.",
            "So in the first step.",
            "The authors will scan the clickthrough data once and create a virtual document for each.",

            "One type is query context and the other type is a quick context."

        [
            "Then in the training of weakly supervised LDA, the authors introduce weak supervision supervision by adding a soft constraints.",
