            "8:30 your time by Kurt was a mathematician working in image processing, he gave a talk here about a year ago, which was excellent, so I think it will be well worth waiting or staying here after dinner and then going to this talk and afterwards having a drink here.",

            "Cambridge and Replac got his degree.",

            "He was also a professor in Oxford.",
            "Later on in the engineering Department, before he came back to Cambridge to Microsoft Research where he's a leading a group working on computer vision and image processing related topics, and Blake has a number of prizes, accolades, he's for instance, maybe the most distinguished ones.",
            "He's a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering and Fellow of the Royal Royal Academy of Science in London I guess.",

            "I guess you have been working very hard for a week and now you have another, fairly hefty week ahead of you.",
            "I admire your stamina and staying power with six hours of lectures a day or something that's serious, so I thought in recognition of your stamina and so as not to overstretch it, we should probably have a short break a little bit after six o'clock, just to sort of draw breath.",

            "More developed and at the end when I know what I have actually said, I'll put the new version on the wiki again.",
            "So then you really will have pretty much what I said, maybe emitting one or two things for which I don't have Copyright.",
            "Anne.",
            "So what I want to talk about is.",
            "As it says, Markov random fields models in vision and image processing both how to define the models and why they're interesting and why they're useful and also how to do inference with them when you have them.",

            "Now actually today mostly it's going to be about, you know what sort of models turn out to be useful, and you know why people use them, and you know what?",
            "What models are inadequate and you know a lot.",
            "To motivate the use of mark of random fields and to flesh out some of the details of what sort of models people use, and then tomorrow will be mostly about the optimization.",
            "And actually Mark random fields have been used in vision for.",
            "Well, they first got popular in the late 70s actually, and then people were working on them through the mid 80s and then they kind of got lost and people moved on to other things and they come back with a vengeance.",
            "In the last five years or so.",
            "And there are some interesting reasons for that, which I'll talk about as they go on.",

            "It turns out that optimization under these probability distributions over images their distributions.",

            "Safely over that number of variables, you have to be really quite circumspect.",
            "And the beautiful thing about mark of random field so that will come back to this a number of times is that.",
            "For the cost, if you like of local effects over the image that is associating pixels with their very near neighbors, you get global effects far more than you deserve.",
            "Really, you know you put in this amount of modeling efforts and what you get back is is really a bargain.",
            "That's what I'd say, and so that's what makes these so attractive.",

            "It's because these optimization methods for mark random fields over images.",
            "I've got so much better.",
            "The theory of of optimization over MRF's was developed a lot in the 90s in the computer science community and then in the last five or six years that theory has been specialized to deal with the sorts of models that occur in images.",
            "So in other words, you know the 90s theory was about graphs of somewhat general topology, and the most recent advances.",
            "Optimizations if you like of algorithms that are particularly targeted at images with a very large number of variables and limited connectivity.",
            "We're going to talk about.",
            "And So what I'm going to try and convince you of in the first part is that there are a number of problems that people are very interested in and image processing and computer vision, all of which fit very neatly into this Markov random field framework.",
