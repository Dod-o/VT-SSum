            "If we work on certain project then again similar things will happen and similar things will go on and so forth.",
            "So we said OK, let's.",
            "Put this concept in place that we work in a certain context, which we will name, and then all the people that are involved in this will work in this context and all the documents and the tasks which they will perform and which they will process, and so forth are somehow associated with this context.",

            "Do context.",
            "So for example when we decide in the company dead and you bid will be prepared, we will create a new context and then we will.",

            "Who works?",
            "Together on this and so forth.",
            "So this is 1 concept around which we are structuring the workspace.",
            "And then if we look at the documents which we process in Word and in outlook in Excel and so forth.",
            "These are then files or email messages which.",
            "You need to remember where you have them stored.",
            "Buy pot names.",
            "You organize this in sub directories whatever and you put them on certain shared folders so that they can be shared and so forth, and we can see that in latest versions of office tools for example, there are some additional attributes which you can fill in, like the author title, some categories and so forth which would help you to better navigate to better find these things.",
            "And we believe that.",
            "This is a very good start up, but this is all done on the document level and it's difficult to share between employees and so forth.",
            "So we said OK, let's try to bring into the workspace the concept of info resource and this basically means let's create a bit more of metadata.",
            "Above 1 particular Word document or email message or whatever and maintain this metadata in the workspace so that it can be shared between the employees that have the rights to see it and modified it and so on.",
            "And this additional metadata would help to better navigate and better describe particular documents.",
            "Image which you work with.",
            "So we call this info resources so info resources will be.",
            "Also, one concept in the workspace which we will cover and the sort of thing is tasks.",
            "Basically this is what Marcel described like knowledge, problm.",
            "Hello Sissy sort was the unstructured.",
            "What we what is now the right word for this unformal or knowledge.",
            "But yeah, so if you're really down then a bit then you come to the task level.",
            "So I'm referring to them also as like tasks.",
            "So this is another important concept in the workspace.",
            "And then there was another point which we also addressed, which is very fundamental to the project.",
            "From the workspace perspective.",
            "And this is that today in the enterprise there is a number of existing tools which on individual basis work OK for you, and you are used to use them, for example in academia people use this Openoffice suite or whatever, and in enterprise and business it's the Microsoft Office.",
            "Sweet that is used so one of our goals was to say, OK, let's see how this existing tools can be extended in a way to support these three concepts, which I described that we would like to see in the workspace.",
            "So an important part of the workspace is this extended existing applications and then.",
            "This process when we develop or transform this existing program like Ms Word into something that would work together with the workspace.",
            "This is what we call the activation.",
            "So sometimes this is quite a huge effort needed for this.",
            "We will see then there are several ways how to approach this in several levels.",
            "So basically to summarize this.",
            "Oh in the Knowledge Workspace we would like to cover the.",
            "Concepts of working contexts which are shared between users of information resources.",
            "This is that is rich meta data on top of the existing documents and emails and stuff like this which you have on your machine and the knowledge processes or tasks.",
            "I ain't trying to do this as much as possible by extending the existing software not to introduce too many new software tools.",
            "Now we will.",

            "Then we need of course D. Workspace services that would deal with all these contexts, tasks, meta data and so forth, and we need some way of user interaction in addition to what's available into GIS of the particular activity, applications, and so we need to have the desktop and the web.",

            "OK, maybe maybe we will have more luck now.",

            "See if this will work.",
            "Who?",
            "So it's very simple attacking every user can contribute tax and there is this list of available once already in the system and then we are using this tag recommender service to get the recommended text.",

            "Being able to distribute this service is also partially locally so that you would always have one version at the back and then the information which is used by a certain user, most often on his desktop, will be cashed locally and certain services could run locally also it.",
            "Yes, yes yes.",
            "This is implants.",
            "So this is how the how the tagging dialogue looks like on the client.",

            "Say something on G. There is now this list of already available tags that start with G and so forth.",
            "You can to streamline the operation.",
            "A bit and like I said, the tech recommendation service is available, but in this across firewall environments will not work, so I would need to establish a completely isolated workspace here.",
            "But this is just a bit too much of an effort.",
