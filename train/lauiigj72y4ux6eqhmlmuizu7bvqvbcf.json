            "Is it possible for a user to have permissions only on one vocabulary and not on the others or or or the on operation level?",
            "Yeah, at the moment 80 is the users have a general profile and this profile is applied to all the older vocabularies.",
            "So usually I mean just on a matter of trust with the users.",
            "If the user have to have different different allowances for different projects, we may create 2 users and save them to the same physical person, but we might even split so we don't need to trust that match the user.",
            "We might split actually did the permissions for the two virtual users.",
            "For the vocabularies that may, they may add it anyway.",
            "The next version has already been featured in this as a top requested.",
            "Think so for the next version.",
            "There would be an additional dimension in the user profiling, so everything actually will be scheduled for each different data set.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thanks to you other questions.",
            "Set thank you.",

            "Use workbench.",
            "Can you elaborate a little bit on that?",
            "Sorry it can.",

            "Some other thisaway like oil walk which use are aligned with Workbench.",
            "Can you elaborate a little bit worse?",
            "If yes, in the car specifically for the one you mentioned, that is your work, right?",
            "We are in contact with the Documentation Office and they still have in production.",
            "They old system that they were using but they are concretely experimenting with bunch.",
            "They are partially the sum of the user already using it and in some cases they might.",
            "Let's say explore export the content that they have developed, will punch through the main.",
            "The main data sets and also they have a development team which is developing some extensions for Workbench.",
            "For us specifically meeting their requirements, any case we are also very close contact with them to gather feedback for the next versions of log bench.",
            "Other questions.",
            "I have a quick question actually just a curiosity.",
            "Do you have plans to extend the work bench even for the same?",
            "Managing an creating owl ontologies?",
            "Not only is cause vocabularies.",
            "Yeah, um OK as a first thing semantic Turkey already allows the older services for our wedding already available in semantic Turkey.",
            "It allows, let's say, basical editing with, so that consists basically in everything but axioms actually.",
            "Now we are developing we are most concluded an editor also for the axiomatic part vowel in ontologies.",
            "But we have to put everything in box bench.",
            "The problem is just to barely speaking we have a very small team, especially for the Workbench interface because we are we have a team that is working partially on devolution, semantic Turkey partially on covering.",
            "New services for Block Punch and then there is one person covering the user interface of Workbench.",
            "An interaction with semantic Turkey.",
            "We work also in a distributed environment.",
            "So yeah, there are a lot of features actually that we're pushing forward, but there is a bottleneck 'cause we have a lack of knew human effort for bringing all of these news inside work bench, but it's on the stack.",
            "Thank you other question.",
            "I have another one actually, so an about alignment.",
            "You have said that Volk bench allow you to align concepts in a particular vocabulary to other concepts.",
            "I think within the environment, but what about to align concepts to link data such as DB pedia or whatever?",
            "Yeah yeah, this is as I said, part of the future future works and actually there is already something in place on semantic Turkey currently.",
            "The thing is, either if you want everything not automated but follow it step by step without any necessity to physically write the UI, you might expect only the information which is contained inside block bench.",
            "So you may have different projects and you might access to all the other projects.",
            "If you want to gather something from Dexter from from from the web data, actually you have for the moment only the possibility to to manually input it.",
            "But in semantic it is already system which allows to perform seamless navigation between local data and link data.",
            "So if you click if a concept is linked, not necessarily through a mapping property, but any kind of property is mentioning.",
            "In any case something which is neither on the local project or any other project insides.",
            "We will look on the web data and unlimited data.",
            "So and you will see more or less the same interface.",
            "So in this sense it will become like a link in the browser and you have we are featuring thinking about different scenarios for alignment, again without putting into the matter automatic algorithms.",
            "What we want to see is how we can perform things easily from the user perspective.",
            "From the administrators perspective and obviously from the final experience of the user.",
            "The point is that.",
            "The book mentions not a desktop tool.",
            "You cannot just say I don't know.",
            "I want to map agribank to jam it there already mappings for that, but suppose you want to do that.",
            "So what do you do?",
            "You are a single user and you just download all jemmott inside Workbench.",
            "If all the user makes something like this you will break your server in a very short moment.",
            "So the point is the best thing is to provide for C2 scenarios.",
            "One scenario is you asked with an instructor.",
            "OK, I want to run some kind of mapping project, so I asked you to download, jam it to make this project.",
            "Actually there is a complex project management system already on in semantic Turkey, for which you might say this project is allowed to see.",
            "These are the project or even mediated by the allowance for the users, and so these user could for instance ask for a project to be read only for normal editing, but being used by for instance agribank for looking for alignments.",
            "Obviously having bought the Zouri in place inside the same instance allows for up better inspection of the data because you can stress it as much as you want, but on the other side there are more lightweight options.",
            "For instance, suppose that you are a user.",
            "You want to look for some other.",
            "Concept from your book and maybe your work is not loaded on your instance.",
            "In this case you may use different approach.",
            "One is you look on block bench and then you run some queries, maybe regex on the on the on the standard sparkle and point that you know or the final results.",
            "Or you may start from the resorts from the extender resource on the linked data and you may use the free text search which is more powerful or block bench to look for the best candidate for the remote one.",
            "And then you can choose the direction of the line.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Let's thank Armando.",
