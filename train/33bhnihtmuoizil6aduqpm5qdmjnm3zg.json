            "So not only could they see, but they would be able to see without glasses or contact lenses.",
            "And he said the obstacle now is that when lenses implanted, you can imagine there's some uncertainty in the position as little as 50 microns forward or back of the desired position will give an observable appreciable deterioration of vision.",

            "It locally generates radicals.",
            "The small molecules are consumed there, it changes the density and refractive index of the material and you produce a hologram.",
            "The problem for just directly taking that material and using it in the eye has many aspects, one of which is time, so the time scale for diffusion goes as the square of the length scale.",
            "If you're writing a hologram, you're looking at length scales less than a Micron.",
            "If you're looking at a lens in the eye, you're looking at a length scale of millimeters.",
            "So instead of being able to write a hologram in minutes, it would take over two years to adjust it in a lens in the eye.",
            "Another problem, of course, is that the small molecules that are used in the holographic materials are toxic and they would reach out.",
            "So Bob and I looked down and said Dan, what polymers are approved for use in the eye, and one of the ones that's widely used is silicone an I said, damn, that's great.",
            "Silicones are wonderful.",
            "They can have a very low glass transition, so diffusion can be relatively rapid, so you might have a chance to adjust across millimeter distances.",
            "And of course they are crystal clear their foldable and so on, so we drew.",
            "Just a dream, a sketch of a material that had a network covalent network of silicones with free molecules in it that thermodynamically would not leave the lens.",
            "So if you make a short chain of similar structure to the network then it will stay in the network.",
            "So in particular with silicones, if you make a short silicone that's in soluble in lipids and insoluble in water, we reasoned that it wouldn't leave the lens and you could implant at the body and it would stay there.",
            "In addition, we can incorporate a photoinitiator that can also be covalently tethered to the network.",
            "If you need to make sure that it won't diffuse anywhere, and by choice of that photoinitiator you get to choose the wavelength of light that will be used so you can look up the spectrum of the transmission of the cornea, choose a wavelength that's close enough to the UV that you perceive it as clear and colorless, yet far enough to the visible that it's transmitted by the cornea.",
            "Then you choose your photo initiator so it's a nice sketch.",
            "It's amenable to all kinds of aspects of design and and Dan said, OK, you've got money.",
            "He said, you know, I know, a foundation at San Francisco Little Fund this tomorrow, so he enabled us to get a postdoc working on making the materials.",
            "It took a year and a half to get a nice system working, but the diffusion time scales on the order of a few hours, an adjustment range.",
            "In this case, initially we were looking at refractive index that was enough to bring 98% of patients to their best corrected vision.",

            "OK, so if you have an initial shape of an object, so suppose this is your lens and it has the network strands shown in green and the free oligomer's shown in pink.",
            "They are actually the same chemical structures, just a different color.",
            "To see them, if you irradiate in the Center for example.",
            "You consume the free molecules there.",
            "At that point, nothing has changed.",
            "There's a negligible change of density or refractive index, so the lens hasn't changed yet.",
            "But what you've created is a driving force for diffusion.",
            "So now you have a concentration gradient of Mac rumor that will result in a migration and net transfer of Makram are from the regions that were not irradiated down the gradient into the regions that were irradiated.",
            "So if you.",
            "Irradiate the center.",
            "You create a bulge.",
            "You shorten the refractive index of your lens.",
            "If instead you had irradiated the perimeter.",
            "Then you would take material from the middle diffuse to the outside, you flatten the lens, you increase its focal length.",
            "Similarly you can irradiate along any Meridian you're free to do virtually anything you want.",
            "Once you've got the desired shape, you can irradiate everywhere.",
            "That causes all the free molecules to become crosslinked, and at that point it's chemically the same as lens materials that have been used for 20 years in the eye, so it should be well tolerated and stable.",
            "So we made some simple lenses.",
            "Or yeah, this is a lot of fun, so I never intended to be part of a startup company.",
            "I'm not a very entrepreneurial person, but startup company picked up the idea and they hired.",
            "Afik, artists, so this is a graphic artist version of what a professor showed on the previous slide.",
            "So here's the polymerization of the free molecules in the central zone.",
            "At that point, the lens still has the same shape, the same refractive index.",
            "But over a period of a few hours, there's a diffusion of these small molecules into the region where they were depleted, and that produces the shape change that actually adjusts the lens power.",
            "So if you had one of these in your eyes over the course of a few hours, you would see things coming into focus, and then once it's got the desired state, you irradiate everywhere covalently lock in all of the free molecules, so then they can definitely not Leach out.",
            "They can't defuse anywhere if the sunlight.",
            "Hits the lens, it won't change its shape.",

            "Every time I show this, people ask, could you adjust it more than once?",

            "You know, we haven't figured out how you could have that much sunlight hit the lens and not change any of the strategies that we came up with for reversible one.",
            "So a very simple experiment that we did in making you know little lenses that we molded in the lab out of this material and we simply imaged a wrong key ruling through the lens and basically the image I'll show in the next slide.",
            "It basically looks like vertical zebra stripes and the characteristics that you're looking for are then the contrast.",
            "In order to get a qualitative indication of the optical quality and using those simple experiments, we were able to demonstrate that the materials gave adequate optical quality similar to commercial lenses for intraocular lenses that they gave very titratable shape change that you could very systematically and reproducibly produce incremental changes in the material, and after irradiating the entire material, we were able to prove.",
            "That any local exposure did not change the lens, so it was effective.",
            "And also the material has to be sensitive enough that you can adjust it with safe levels of exposure, but it must not be so sensitive that it changes in ambient light and we were able to demonstrate that that's also achievable.",

            "The actual change.",
            "So the focal length changed from 11 millimeters to 4 millimeters.",
            "It's a really wide adjustment range.",
            "It was five times greater than we could have expected from refractive index alone, and that's when we realized.",
