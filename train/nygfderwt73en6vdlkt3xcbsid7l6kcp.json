            "A lot is dealing with faces, so not just face recognition, but doing expression recognition, trying to actually just track where faces, synthesizing new faces, and things like that.",
            "And if you're able to do really good registration like dense registration, you can do very, very good job.",
            "All these other things become a lot easier, like trying to recognize a phase, trying to recognize expression, because you're actually getting the proper measurements from the face.",
            "Whereas up until kind of quite recently up until the last, like five years or so, people tend to do this stuff just using a box kind of putting a big box around it and is applying it straight to machine learning.",
            "But what I'm going to try to argue to you guys today is that actually you should be relying on computer vision for a lot more than just providing a box.",
            "You should be trying to get very, very dense.",
            "Registration could have better the registration that you have.",

            "But even with the box detector, these sort of things are difficult because when you're tracking an object overtime especially.",

            "I mean some of you guys might think well, what exactly are you meaning by registration?",
            "And why is registration tracking hard?",
            "The other thing that we were talking talking about First off is exhaustive search and we'll talk more about that.",
            "But that's essentially what I'm talking about.",
            "Is if I don't know any better, let's just go through and search every possible position in an image and that might sound kind of naive and silly to you.",
            "But actually, for a lot of the modern day, things that are going on, that's exactly what algorithms do.",
            "I just do a very very smartly, but they just essentially they do that, so we'll talk about that, and then we'll also talk about some machining machine learning parts.",

            "It wasn't even an odd people going.",
            "Yes, we know.",
            "So with generative and discriminative models, that's definitely creeped into vision.",
            "And I'm not going to bore you guys too much with that, But the interesting thing is that what makes it sort of different from generic machine learning is actually you also have to consider the search, so you have to consider how I'm searching an image can really dictate what type of classifier I can use and whether it should be generative or discriminative and what sort of constraints I have on the classifier.",
            "And this is really kind of like a hot topic.",
            "Research in vision at the moment saying that.",
            "OK, well if I'm going to take the search strategy to search an image in terms of registration, what sort of constraints or bounds do I have on my classifier?",
            "So rather than kind of taking oh from learning this classifier works really well.",
            "Let's just apply it.",
            "You have to really consider the search 'cause no one is going to want to use it.",
            "If it takes a couple of days to search for an image.",
            "And so that's something that's really important.",
            "So that's kind of how I frame this.",
            "So we'll also talk about, say, with exhaustive search, there are some things that have been done with the fast Fourier transform and kind of do things quickly there, but also as a result of dealing in the Fourier domain, you can do some kind of cool learning, which I'm not sure if you guys are familiar with.",
            "I wasn't familiar with it until I got to CMU.",
            "Things correlation filters and.",
            "Extensions like mice, filters and things like that.",
            "So for some of you you might have heard of others.",
            "Hopefully that's something new and obviously support vector machines and things like that applying to exhaustive search and then also talking about the speed and performance now.",
            "And also representations.",
            "So there are things like integral images, hands up who's heard of the Viola Jones detector based detector.",
            "Hopefully there OK well for those for those for those in the crowd that haven't.",
            "That's essentially you commit the generic.",
            "Mainstream face detector that everyone in vision kind of uses.",
            "So if you kind of want to do something really naive and you want to since you want to make car detector, face detector, whatever sort of detector you go into, this package called Open CV.",
            "You can download free off the net and you can train what up they've got models that already there and if you do really good job, it's actually surprising how good how good a job it does of detecting faces, and he can do it very very quickly and will talk about how those detectors work and kind of.",

            "Yeah, prattling on here about their outline.",
            "But all this speed up here.",
            "Now I said at something little just briefly about exhaustive search.",
            "Now obviously exhaustive search sounds like a good idea, but you'll be saying, well, it's NP hard.",
            "It takes a lot of computation, things like that, and that's exactly that's very true when you're trying to do very, very dense registration.",
            "So I was showing the pretty picture of the mesh over peoples faces and things like that.",
            "You can't do that exhaustive search, it's too difficult.",
            "It's it'll take you too long.",
            "This is too many parameters, too much space to search, so we look into other things in vision, such as gradient searches.",
            "And also give some motivation on how we get these gradient searches and also how we can do them efficiently.",
            "And there's actually for the gradient search.",
            "Essentially Envision when people talk about gradient search, the essentially talk about classic algorithm which is Lucas Kanade algorithm.",
            "Hopefully some of you have heard of it optical flow and things like that.",
            "That's something that's kind of very much keen vision and people even though people come up with different ideas and different extensions to it, it tends to in the literature always sort of come back to this.",
            "This lock stock algorithm and how we can speed this up and I'll talk about some speedups.",
            "And then the 4th lecture will be kind of talking into exactly how we do this sort of this cruel nonrigid registration.",
            "So what I mean by nonrigid is anything that can't be described by an affine warp and will talk about what I mean by fine, but an affine warp is essentially a warp that is translation.",
            "Scale and rotation, so that's at a rigid warp and anything that has any other variation other than that rigid warp is classified as non rigid an essentially if you think about most objects most objects are non rigid, so that's why there's a lot of interest and even a medical, and then obviously in faces and walking and things like that.",

            "Um?",

            "There's no change in scale, so there's all a lot of different warps, and there's a lot of different.",

            "Actually I can do a pretty good job at it, but as soon as any kind of difference.",
