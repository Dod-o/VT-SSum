            "Things become much more complicated than because first, you need to think about whether you are extension of the model, provides some kind of Canonical representation, which means that there is a single optimal solution, or because if you would use a model that allows for manifold of solutions, then it becomes much more difficult when you have a nonlinear problem and.",

            "OK which measures?",
            "Able to identify the underlying structure.",
            "And then there's the separate as an independent question whether this model is able or to answer, or whether we can say that problem conduction solved or not.",
            "And could you like the question for which is is it direct or indirect?",
            "Couldn't you always like parceling out specific signal?",
            "Couldn't you apply this to any measure?",
            "So you, say, for example, phase, then you carefully?",
            "If you're partial our point signal.",
            "Say into medium one.",
            "Then you see look at the facial another parceling out some some other source or channel, and then you could always like for any measure by parceling out as a general method, you could figure out whether something is direct or indirect.",
            "Yeah, I have not thought about that question so far.",
            "Maybe it's possible, but one thing you need to consider is I think the aspect of of volume conduction in that case 2, because depending on how you're mixing matrix look like, it could happen that you're mixing matrix is actually canceling out some of the face at a certain node at a certain electrode.",
            "So then the question is, what do you do if through the mixing matrix this is cancelled out and then you use a kind of partially?",
