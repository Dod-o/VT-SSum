            "You are no longer visible to followers, which means I've retweeted this message today and tomorrow.",

            "The outreach of the message.",

            "Yeah, in the end how many people have treated the message?",
            "So in this case as equal to 8?",
            "You see that there are like eight people.",

            "If you remove the red person in the middle?",

            "Or you can make S number of people retweeted message.",
            "So this is 1 realization, so if you run the simulation of the experiment again with the same message, you might have seven or nine people return message.",

            "The giant component will reach 16,000, so you just multiply by these two numbers.",

            "That was what I was talking about.",

            "And who you like?",

            "And do we see that difference?",
            "So yeah, if you have finished anyone, tell me what.",
            "Where is the 2nd peak?",
            "In the distribution.",
            "Still running.",
            "So just imagine we are working with 100,000 nodes.",
            "And a few average degrees.",
            "And 20 simulation rounds take so much time.",
            "If you really want to do this on, say, the Twitter network.",
            "Even you feel parallels lines, your code is probably going to take forever years for supercomputer to do that.",
            "Cause the complexity just goes goes up insane.",
            "Anyone finished running?",
            "So what the two pics where are they?",
            "Right so.",
            "Right, it's the same pic, right?",
            "So this is the interesting problem.",
            "Trying to make cause in the previous simulation you pick random nodes, so expect every secret to be less than 10 for these nodes.",
            "But they give you the same peak positions.",
            "US when you pick the largest nodes.",
            "And that means.",
            "If you choose a large nodes as your seed node, you pick Donald Trump to start spreading the news.",
            "You really won't affect the giant component size, or you won't affect how many people you can reach.",
            "By starting from him, what effects is the probability that you're rich, the giant component, or the probability that you reach the right peak?",
            "So if you compare this histogram.",
            "With this histogram, the two peaks on the right at exactly the same position.",
            "It's just that the peak is larger, is taller on the.",
            "When you start with the larger nodes and small nodes, so this is exactly the result I was talking about.",
            "You pick nose.",
            "You won't affect the position of of these two histograms.",
            "You only you only affects the relative height of it, and this is a very strong theoretical foundation from percolation theory in statical physics.",
            "And if find this usage in in this particular problem.",
            "Alright, so I can see they expect their influence in this case.",
            "It's 0.24 is way higher than the previous case where it was only 0.16, but it's not really many times higher as what you would expect, although the degree is 1000 times higher.",
            "But the influence is only less than twice.",
            "Of course, the easy way to get around this is trying to explain this is be cause cause of complexity.",
            "So it doesn't really go up linearly, but of course actually.",
            "Operation theory in physics can give you a very well defined formula to calculate this number exactly.",
            "But that's a little bit beyond this course, so yeah.",
            "So you can see you still have a little bit of.",
            "Chance to not being spread, not being spread means you only spread locally to nearest neighbors.",
            "Maybe your best friends who PT you tend to spread Rita it showing some sympathy.",
            "In this yeah.",
            "This already happens.",
            "So yeah.",
            "So let's keep this one.",
            "Of course.",
            "There are many measures of Network North properties.",
            "We come across degree distribution, so you know who are the ones have more neighbors, who are ones, has less neighbors.",
            "So here we use another way to pick the nodes so so remember what we're trying to solve is we're trying to maximize the influence of information, so the information is characterized only by its spreading ability.",
            "Is the beta and Alpha value here, which means what's the likelihood any of your neighbors tend to retrieve the message?",
            "And was a chance to recover from the message, which means you lose your visibility to friends.",
            "So these are intrinsic to the message.",
            "But there are things intrinsic to the nodes and we are in order to maximize the outreach of your information you need to pick nodes appropriately.",
            "So the first simulation will pick nodes randomly.",
            "And the second simulation we try to optimize our peaking or selection by selecting the nodes with the highest degree.",
            "In this case we use another way to select our nodes discord between the centrality.",
            "If you are unfamiliar with the term, you can refer to Wikipedia.",
            "It's pretty.",
            "Yeah, elaborate if so.",
            "Here you can run this simulation by choosing the nodes with hires.",
            "Between the centrality, the five nodes and you can see.",
            "You get effectively the same results.",
            "Am the influence of the nose is somehow similar to the nodes with the largest degrees?",
            "So it shows these two methods, but above very optimal.",
            "Very efficient as spreading information, but again the same thing is observed here.",
            "The position of the peak is still between 0.42 and 0.4.",
            "It doesn't change, so even you change the set of nodes, the peak position stays here.",
            "You won't shift right, you won't shift left.",
            "And of course there is still a tiny bit of fraction of realizations.",
            "It shouldn't be.",
            "Actually.",
            "There's no realization here, it just I think it just thought you just aligned.",
            "Yeah, so in this case.",
            "The information will always spread to a lot of people and it won't spread locally.",
            "So the localization the localized transmission spreading, you only happen when.",
            "Yeah, when you spread into virtually almost 0 number of nodes.",
            "Alright.",
            "Just give you guys some time to.",
            "Finish the simulation to get a feeling yourself.",
            "So again, just to emphasize the point, I mean, if there is only one takeaway message.",
            "Only emphasize the ending in the emphasis here is.",
            "The position of the peak.",
            "Left or right.",
            "Is only dependent on the message itself, is only intrinsic to the message.",
            "The people's influence who started treating it the influence doesn't doesn't affect the position of peak by affect.",
            "The height of the peak.",
            "So, and there's something we want to optimize here.",
            "Alright, most people have done.",
            "See most you are away from keyboard so.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So OK, then there is another interesting about this, as our models on networks.",
            "It's both for disease spreading.",
            "The information spreading is there is a bimodal behavior that is, so there are two by model behaviors here.",
            "So this bimodal behavior we're talking about either give you if you fix the message, you fix the same nodes you either spread or don't spread.",
            "But there's another by model behavior, and we call it the critical point here is.",
            "The message itself.",
            "Just now we're changing the people.",
            "Now we can change the message.",
            "Right, we can say there is a more interesting message and there's a message is less interesting.",
            "So the more interesting message, get higher chance of retweets by any individual that follows you.",
            "And the less interesting just get lower channels.",
            "So let's run again.",
            "Let's run the simulation on different set of network and this time instead of using Barabasi Albert Network which has a hero Genius network degree distribution, we use adults training network which is more homogeneous in degrees.",
            "So in this case again we have 1000 nodes and.",
            "On average, everyone only have 5 neighbors.",
            "So it's relatively small.",
            "We can ensure we finish.",
            "Our simulation in time.",
            "And in here, the transmission probability a means there is a 0.0 one chance.",
            "That any of your neighbors will read the message, and that means if I read the message and have 100 followers on average, one of them will retweet the next time step.",
            "And again, 0.58 basically means.",
            "0.5 basically means each time step I lose my visibility to influence others.",
            "Right?",
            "OK, and could you run this simulation?",
            "Maybe some of you have finished running it.",
            "So again we use only five signals, So what is the only difference thing here is just the network structure right?",
            "Use a different network structure from barbati over network to social network.",
            "And all the rest remain largely the same.",
            "And if you run a simulation and you finish it, you'll see that none of the realizations.",
            "Goes to the right pic.",
            "You don't really go to right pig, so you can practice on my own later.",
            "If you're interested, you can pick the largest node in the network.",
            "You can pick the nose with the hyest between the centrality.",
            "Whatever knows you pick, you can just choose all the nodes mean you can choose all kinds of nodes in the network any 5.",
            "You always stay here.",
            "Your message will never spread out.",
            "You almost spread locally to yourself.",
            "And this is another interesting, so I can see the influence of these five nodes is only 0.059 and that means they already 5 nodes.",
            "That that are sitting.",
            "So in addition, we got one new node.",
            "No matter how big you are, so this is interesting phenomenon.",
            "Which means if the message.",
            "Itself.",
            "Has a spreading probability.",
            "That is too low.",
            "Lower than the threshold, your message will never spread out, no matter how much money you put into buying Donald Trump to spread this message for you, it doesn't really help.",
            "Anne this treshold?",
            "So I was talking about below a threshold larger than the threshold and this threshold is solely determined by the structure of your network.",
            "So, so in this case, just remember in the previous example of user barbati over network an if you just randomly choose five nodes.",
            "You always observe.",
            "A pig.",
            "A large pick here, but it's not the case here.",
            "And what does that tell you?",
            "And that tells you that for Barbossa, Evernote Barbati over network.",
            "The critical threshold is really small, so almost any message.",
            "Is more interesting than the threshold required, so there is always chance.",
            "The message will prevail.",
            "But for this case, if you run a simulation, if you're spreading out the information on Twitter network.",
            "Depicted not to the other sharing network with similar degree distributions.",
            "Your message may just never spread out, no matter who you talking net, and this is predetermined by a network topology, so this is where you see that.",
            "Actually the structure of the network really really affects your dynamics and the eventual outcome of your problem.",
            "But Luckily or unluckily in real world, although shredding network is almost never observed, empirical data, so being like a Twitter network, Facebook network, whatever online social network you observe there almost all barabasi over lack, which means that very little genius degree distributions like people like Donald Trump can have hundreds or thousands and some celebrities have millions of followers where people like me.",
            "There's less than 10 so.",
            "I mean, yeah, so it's very hit or genius and it's usually a power law distributed.",
            "So that is good, right?",
            "That it means any message even over.",
            "Nobody even have a very stupid message.",
            "There is slight chance no matter how small it is, but there is a chance that it can spread out.",
            "But if imagine if our our social network is as homogeneous as double sharing network and there will be very very bad.",
            "I mean you can see that almost all messages, the majority of the messages that will fall below the critical threshold and you'll never spread out.",
            "But if you cause the same mathematics applies to social, social media information spreading as well as disease spreading.",
            "It is good for social media spreading.",
            "Maybe for like Gundam style and stuff, but it might not be good for disease spreading cause that means no matter how.",
            "Little infectious disease.",
            "The disease the disease is.",
            "On other Barabasi Albert Network, there's also chance Nonnegligible chance you'll spread out cause the critical threshold is 0, so any disease will be will have infection power modern 0 so you always have the chance to spread out, so that's not really good.",
            "Alright.",
            "So when you're above the threshold, so how do you make it above the threshold?",
            "You increase the chance that people will reach you too.",
            "In this case, if 100 followers on average 15 of them will retweet my message within the day.",
            "Yep.",
            "So if you just change the single parameter.",
            "You can see a new peak on the right.",
            "I've gotta pick.",
            "Position is different from the body Opera network.",
            "That depends really on your network topology and if you run this simulation many times, you can see that actually no matter what kind of nodes you select, five nodes, you select the beginning.",
