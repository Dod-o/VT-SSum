            "So Freeman's algorithm is described in a paper which appeared in nature awhile ago, and what we've shown here are the results of applying this affinity propagation method to our graph into our image similarity measure, and so the first set of examples here show a set of faces under different poses and expressions, and the affinity propagation method is able to extract class examples correctly for four different classes.",
            "We then explored a much larger problem which involves a data images taken from the coil.",
            "Google and our own datasets 55,000 in total, where we know what the classes of objects present are, and in the paper we give we give values based on the F measure which is a harmonic mean of the precision and recall and the method appears to work fairly effectively.",
