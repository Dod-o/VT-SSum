            "And the second briefer on the research words, it strikes me that.",
            "Words specific to research would vary according to topic, and they could be quite large.",
            "You could have many of them and so yeah, just wondering about the size of that and what your experience was.",
            "So the first question where did we get inspired for these features?",
            "So we read a lot of books.",
            "There are a lot of books that are being published just for like science writers, so it's not really maybe literature on science writing, but there all these handbooks for science writers and they talk a lot about how to use like visual language and so on and off.",
            "And it's by example.",
            "So they give you articles and then the annotate articles with like.",
            "Here are some really good analogies that people tend to make and so on.",
            "But the human interest one is something that's generally like studied in journalism.",
            "So in journalism, does this concept of news frames so a template for writing a news article and some common use frames or something like conflict.",
            "So when you try to like talk about two things and conflict people kind of find them interesting and human interests is something that they generally like and even flesh, flesh initial papers try to compute a human interest score even for readability by.",
            "The argument that of the articles more interesting, the person is probably more inspired to read it with more concentration and that improves your readability.",
            "So he actually also computed words like people or folks to kind of try to get at the human interest aspect.",
            "So it was kind of inspired by these prior work.",
            "Order the second question so the research words there is such words, yes, so right now we have around.",
            "70 words in the dictionary, and they're kind of divided by is this about like people working on research?",
            "Or is this about the process of doing research is about publishing?",
            "So yeah, it's a small set and then we have a number of like.",
