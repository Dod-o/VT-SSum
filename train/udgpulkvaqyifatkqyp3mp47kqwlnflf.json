            "Queries, in fact, if it's large, if you have a large number of sources, I think there is some kind of vertical limit that you cannot go over with just valid query processing.",
            "So do you think that we are reaching the limit of what we can do with Federated query processing?",
            "And I think that this limit is too restricted for what we want to do in semantic web.",
            "So how you can think that we can go over this limit.",
            "So in general, like we only use here 13 datasets and we show that when it comes to complex or large data queries, we already be on or over the limit.",
            "So the current Federation engine are not up to the standard you want to tackle with 13 datasets.",
            "So when we are going more further.",
            "Of course there is need to, you know, design more stable Federation engines, but currently we are lacking in that case.",
            "I can go for another question or we have to move forward.",
            "OK, don't you think that basically when we do Federated query processing, it's because we don't have a good data placement for the data.",
            "This is why we do Federated query processing.",
            "Not you think that it is in fact an incentive for centralization.",
            "If you want to go over Federated Query, you have to re centralized data.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Sorry I didn't get the exact question, so it means that you have poor performance because that are decentralized.",
            "You want acceptable performance, don't you think that we need to decentralize data?",
            "So currently when I'm performing experiments so the more we are decentralizing, the more like we are losing the performance.",
            "So maybe it's because of the Federation engine are not that much, you know?",
            "Well, but current is this case if we are more going into centralization, the performance is improving, so we definitely need some stable Federation engine.",
            "And then maybe we can go into the decentralisation part.",
            "But currently it's not like that I Daniel will also present the next paper and it's about these Federation strategies and there we also proved if the more we distribute data the more we lost performance.",
