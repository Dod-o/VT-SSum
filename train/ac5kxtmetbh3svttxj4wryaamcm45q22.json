            "And biology is generating problems that there is a reasonable acknowledgement that biologists themselves.",

            "We don't know how the world works, but we think there is reason to believe that this world that is generating a lot of this data.",
            "Could is such that the underlying mechanism that's generating the data could be approximated by some function.",

Yeah, times the likelihood of the features conditioned on the class divide by the normalizing constant.",
