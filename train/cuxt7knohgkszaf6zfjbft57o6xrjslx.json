            "Question for coffee.",

            "I have two questions relating to to solve those questions.",
            "Also about link prediction in these networks using machine learning.",
            "So you described in the beginning that there's some strong kind of assortment bias in these networks that biologists focus, often focusing in the small scanner in the small scale literature in this market.",
            "So that's that's why it's why it's important when we're doing network analysis.",
            "We always only used a systematic, high throughput data.",
            "We think they are.",
            "Very high quality and they don't have this ascertainment bias.",
            "They still have a certain bias from any particular method because no method can detect everything.",
            "There's certain plants that fall out so immediately the data set is biased, but there's attainment bias.",
            "That's really something when you study one protein at a time.",
            "You do a genetic.",
            "You do use virus screen.",
            "You want to follow up one or two and then you pick the ones that either you know something about or the ones that you think are important because you know something about and so that's where it comes in.",
            "And that's the mechanism by which this thing is being created.",
            "Right, and but with the high throughput technologies we get to a stage where we have enough knowledge, enough data, enough interactions that are known such that we won't run into the problem that we then use features that you originally used to select your targets to predict new targets.",
            "So for instance that you predict that cancer genes have a lot of interactions because a lot of injections are known for cancer genes because everyone looks at them right?",
            "Absolutely, OK, so that's one point.",
            "The other is.",
            "You showed these networks and, well, the networks exist of existing edges, an of non existing edges.",
            "So how certain are you when you present such a network, we're doing an existing edge.",
            "Yeah, well, that's interactions are not existent between two genes.",
            "That's a very important point in machining when we tried to distinguish between interacting genes and non interacting genes.",
            "Then we train on this knowledge that some interactions are known, some are unknown.",
            "But how certain are you about the non existence of an edge?",
            "I'm not not so that's a huge problem because many Pinot.",
            "Usually you know until until I don't know a couple of years ago we set these systematic experiments are important is because screw you get information about about positive examples and you test everything and you have negative examples.",
            "But what I try to show you here is just because of the biochemical and experimental limitations.",
            "There's a lot of interactions that we are missing at the keypoint are probably these two when we have limited asset sensitivity that translates to used hybrid only gets a fraction of 1 interactions.",
            "Meaning, if we only if you're blind for 60% of the interactions, we cannot make a statement about this, and so we never know whether whether interactions that we are missing our we are missing because they're not there, or because the user is poured addicting it.",
            "So there are a lot of machine learning studies which do this binary classification.",
            "Can you recommend any data set any species in which one should evaluate binary approaches?",
            "In which to evaluate this?",
            "If you develop, sorry if you develop a binary classifier for distinguishing between interacting gene pairs and non interacting pairs.",
            "So then is there a good species?",
            "A good data set which you would recommend to use for that where the non interactions are more certain?",
            "Then in other species or datasets.",
            "Um?",
            "On the one hand, East, because that's where we have the.",
            "Greatest depth in interactive mapping, on the other hand, plans are probably not that big, cause that's where we have the largest network, but the negative classifiers are less certain in this case than in East.",
            "And what I want always always recommend is find a find a collaborator that you cannot come up with very specific predictions and then test it right and then the test can be can be normalized and well controlled and everything using the reference set that I mentioned.",
            "And if you see a trend that's already, that's already extremely reassuring between different predictions of different.",
            "Confidence.",
            "OK, so we have time for one very short question.",
            "OK, I'll try to be short now, just some quick comment about prediction in legend species and evolution analysis.",
            "Let's say another plant species, so it will be interesting to translate this knowledge at the level of demands.",
            "So there the argument of conservation.",
            "An evolutionary convention is much stronger so that you can use to make predictions and all sorts of analysis.",
            "To some extent, yes.",
            "But I think what characterizes this emergence of a new species is not a complete re utilization of all domains, but a subtle tweaking.",
            "And if you have to maintain recognizer peptide sequence, you can do a lot of tweaking just on the peptide sequence without spy.",
            "By leaving the domain and tag right, and so that's where the devil is in the detail, because the specificity you're probably losing.",
            "But in general I agree.",
            "I mean going to domains and doing domain.",
            "Domain based predictions is probably a very good idea because there you can also learn about the specificity parameters of a domain family and then you have a much more refined prediction than if you do.",
            "You know, we do everything at the same time because then these features get lost in the statistical noise.",
