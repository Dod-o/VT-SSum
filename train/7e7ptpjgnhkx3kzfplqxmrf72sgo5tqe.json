            "So for us, an event is something that is anything significant that happens in the world, and one assumption that we in this case make is that if there is something significant happening in the world, there will be news media reporting about this.",

            "This talk about the same thing in here is 1 simple example.",

            "Let's say that you you doing some research on weather changes or whatever.",

            "So you have all this data automatically organized into something which is meaningful.",

            "In this case we still have 18,000 events, but we can also somehow aggregate aggregate in visualize this kind of this list of events.",
            "So one of the things you can do is simply we can say OK, what are these events about Hurricane also about?",
            "And you get the kind of a summary.",
            "So on the left side you have the entities, so people, locations, organizations which are most frequently mentioned in the in the events about hurricanes.",
            "So you see United States, Florida taxes, Haiti, Mexico and so on and on the other hand you have known entities.",
            "So things which are not people, locations, and organizations.",
            "So we have Tropical Cyclone, storm, rain, wind, flood and so on.",
            "What's even more interesting is you can say OK, show me the timeline.",
            "So is there any pattern you know when these events actually happen?",
            "And of course there is right.",
            "So you see, this is the latest one.",
            "So here is the summer of this year, so we have a huge spike.",
            "And then if you go back you see another spike.",
            "And this is basically like one year ago and then you have another spike not so big again, which is another year ago.",
            "So you can easily see that this is like a periodic thing which is happening.",
            "Another thing that you can easily also view is the locations of the events.",
            "So as we said, so we also extract the locations where the events actually happened and you can see them visualized on a map.",
            "So let's say that we.",
            "If so, instead of showing individual dots because there are like many thousands of dots, we just show these groups and these groups basically tell you the number of events that happen in that particular region, so we can see that there is a majority of actually hurricanes or events about hurricanes happening in this region here, which is what we would expect, of course, but we also have.",
            "Other areas like we have also related to Hong Kong and China and also.",
            "A Philippines here.",
            "So this is an you can also Additionally think, maybe you can also select the sub subset of time window and you can say OK in this time window there were these hurricanes and then you can easily just move on and you can see how intensity of the events happened for that particular time window.",
            "Maybe another visualization that summarizes this kind of data is categorization, so all these events are also categorized into categories such as business, politics, sports, and so on and so on.",
            "So we have about 5000 categories like this.",
            "And this is a kind of a visualization of the of all these categories.",
            "So on the most inner level, we have the broad category like science.",
            "And here we have business, SoC, News and so on.",
            "And on the sub level we have a sub category inside science in this case.",
            "So we have earth Sciences and we have atmospheric Sciences.",
            "So we have 14% of events about cyclones.",
            "About hurricanes are actually specifically about atmospheric Sciences, but we also have subcategory here.",
            "For example, inside business energy we have renewable energy and here we have a sub category called oil and gas.",
            "So by clicking on the category you can easily see.",
            "Now the Hurricanes and the impact they have on business.",
            "In this case oil and gas.",
            "So you can see for example here we have an event which describes how Hurricane Harvey actually.",
            "Impacts the crude oil price.",
            "So this would be maybe a enough I think.",
            "Also, we're running a bit out of time regarding the individual visualizations that you can do.",
            "Maybe just a single thing.",
            "So for each event you can also not only view the template that you see here, but you can open the event and you can see the individual news reports about this event.",
            "So here I clicked for example Maria and we have all the articles that describe that we see that describe Maria and you can also switch, let's say from German, from English to German coverage.",
            "So you can see all the different languages and how they report about the same event.",
            "On top of that, you can also let's say, visualize who are the new sources that report about this, how they are geographically distributed, and Additionally you can also find let's say similar events, which would be like.",
            "So this is an event which is about hurricane and a particular set of locations.",
            "But you can also find related events in the past which are similar in this kind of fingerprint, and you can visualize them like this.",
            "Or you can put him on a timeline and you can then scroll scroll between them.",
            "So I'm finished, yeah, so I think this would be it so.",
