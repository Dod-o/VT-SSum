Poland considering Poland, Slovenia these this boundary we see that still there is quite a good potential, and they're quite effective.",

            "Just give me a signal, right?",
            "Great, OK, so we have two least product concept standalone ERP, hosting Marketplace, standalone normal ERP system provided with the basic functionality.",

            "Please don't bother us with warehouse inventories, we have a small system and which is done manual and we don't want to have it fine because they want to reduce the complexity of an ERP system if we give them 100% ERP system and they use only 1015 to 20% of it.",
