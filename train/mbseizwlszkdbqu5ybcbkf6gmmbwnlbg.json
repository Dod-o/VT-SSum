            "So the first observation is that the importance of entities that represent a topic varies overtime, so we saw that we have somehow long-term and short-term lifespans for entities.",

            "Those become probably interested.",

            "So how does it this help us to do personalization so desired question have how can we exploit Twitter based profiles for personalizing users?",

            "So you simply count you look at the entire history of the user and then you count how often did the user refer to this entity or to this hashtag.",
            "And the second weighting scheme was somewhat time sensitive.",

            "This is on dates and we had an evaluation period of 12 days."
        ],
        [
            "So what we actually saw first, which yeah, which user modeling strategy is best for computing personalized recommendations.",
            "So what we kill you see, is that the time sensitive profile improves recommendation quality clearly and so makes sense to wait the current interest stronger than older intra."

        [
            "Another thing is that actually the best user modeling strategy varies for the different types of users.",
            "So for the long term adopters we saw that rather the hashtag based user modeling strategy performed tests, while for the short term adoptes entity based user modeling performed better.",

        [
            "This also if you look at the profile size.",

        ],
        [
            "So in conclusion, what we have seen first for the topics on Twitter, the importance of entities that represent the topic varies overtime, so we saw some how long term entities that.",
            "Important for the topic of a long term of long period of time and we saw short-term entities which are only for the specific moment interesting for the important for the topic.",
            "And similarly for the users users who user interests overtime without first majority of users becomes very quickly interested into the topic topic or not.",

            "For the Twitter based profiles for personalization, we saw first it's very important to do time sensitive user modeling.",
            "So we those interest stronger that the current interests stronger than others.",
            "And we also saw that the selection of best the best user modeling structured strategy actually depends strongly on the types of users that we deal with.",
            "So for future work, there's actually also one important questions that we would like to clarify further there.",
            "So for what type of personalization task can we exploit?",

            "So in particular, for this analysis where we looked at the Egyptian revolution, so we first scanned the hashtags that occurred in this.",
            "For this event and then we gradually continued and looked at, or we identified the important entities that Cooper with this with these hashtags.",

            "Yeah, so I mean at this task is even harder for tweets because tweets are limited to just 148 characters, but So what we also do is that we represent a tweet not just by its 140 characters, but we also related tweets to an external web resources mainly by just following illegal.",
            "So if there is a link inside the tweet then we also look at the web page that was referenced from the tweet.",

            "If everyone is sending 100 tweets about the Egyptian revolution and they only said pen.",

            "Here?",
            "We didn't correlate the normalized by the entire Twitter crowd, let's say, but for sure we normalized.",
            "And yeah, it's not 100 correct that we just know just counted the so to in frequency would mean that we count simply the number of occurrences.",
            "But this time dependent user modeling strategy ways the concepts.",
            "Also in depending on the time so.",
            "The farther you go further you go to the past, the smaller is the influence of the concept.",
