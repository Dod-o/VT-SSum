            "That is, it is defined beforehand.",

            "Applied to it, and I guess that's as my talk, thank you.",

            "So is it easy for a biologist if you go and ask them?",
            "What are good features?",
            "Will they be able to tell you those things or?",
            "We've taken a more natural for them to talk about, maybe cause of mechanisms, and I think for those features it is relatively easy, because when the I think the process of the biologist data is a little bit different from computer science is that they will study from example based.",
            "The first observe some observe some structure and study their sequence saying that the conjecture that maybe some sequence patterns actually signify.",
            "The structure and then when they resolve more structure, they will kind of refine their conceptual representative patterns.",
            "So this is actually accumulated over the years that at the end when we have when we want to workout the problem, there are several publications on the specific protein fold that we are studying.",

            "But if it doesn't, I mean if we don't have anything I've known about this, then we have to go.",
            "Rely back on those common features.",
            "We might be able to do something, not necessarily the best in the sense that achieving the goal what the biologists want to achieve using machine learning algorithm.",

            "Yeah, when we search or when we search through the sequences, we will search over all the combinations of the sequences from the beginning to the end.",
            "But when you have the long range dependencies, theoretically it can.",
            "The model can be dealt with any type of language dependency, but if you want to use in the large application like the ginowan application, it will be better that you will have some dependency.",
