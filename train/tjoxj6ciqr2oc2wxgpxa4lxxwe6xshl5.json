            "However, I notice the current of 600 milli amps necessary to write actually passed through the current through the copper wire.",
            "And of course then you the problem I guess I want to ask you about.",
            "Is if you reduce the size of the magnets and thermal fluctuations kill your memory.",
            "But in order to get switching you need the high current, so I guess.",
            "Are superconducting wires the answer or how do you intend to address that question?",
            "That is a very good point that is exactly right.",
            "So in order to switch the magnets at the so that different contributions to the energy of switching these magnets and I didn't want to go into all of these details, you imagine that you can imagine our sponsors are really interested in that.",
            "So we've done some benchmarking on that so that the magnets themselves require very little energy to switch, especially if you do it automatically.",
            "So if you can reduce the barrier and so by by applying the pumping field.",
            "Essentially reduces the energy barrier required to go from up and down, so the bear that I've shown you in the beginning, which was 10s of Katie right, depends, or you can modulate these distances barrier and so this is the way we do the switching.",
            "Of course, the real issue that is how do you generate these magnetic fields and so you are at the currents that I've shown you with fairly large.",
            "However, this is the size of the current was limited in this case, by switching the input magnet.",
            "So we could have.",
            "We just wanted to have a demonstration, you know, to show that this works.",
            "We did not want to go to the limit so the currents could be reduced by by quite a bit.",
            "But the main the main power dissipation in this way of switching is in the current.",
            "We have done some benchmarking against Silicon or so, and so we think that in principle at least, we can still get out.",
            "You know, with our nose ahead, a little bit.",
            "Of course there are lots of technological issues going to superconducting wires is is a very good idea we.",
            "Did not have funding so far to do that.",
            "However, we are very interested in that with proposals out on that and we are very interested in doing that.",
            "And if anyone is if any interest here, we would be very happy to collaborate.",
            "But yes, definitely, that's one way.",
            "OK, so so this is sort of the issues with energy dissipation when you switch it with this current carrying wires.",
            "Another way of reducing power is to do switching in other ways, like with the multiferroics.",
            "Which is what Berkeley is doing, so that work is not.",
            "It's still science.",
            "That way, and so it's not quite sure what this is going to go, but another Ave is not to switch it with Earth that fields, but to switch it by spin, torque transfer.",
            "And so this is where our collaboration with IBM comes in.",
            "So so we're looking at the different at different possibilities at this point, but there are not very many multiferroics which would be multiferroic at room temperature around, and it's true, it's true.",
            "So again, this is the coupling this week, so it's Berkeley has some has some data where they think they have that at least.",
            "They've gotten hints that they got switching at room temperature.",
            "It's exciting.",
            "Their spin torque would in principle be dissipation.",
            "This, or very little dissipation.",
            "But can it work at high temperatures as well?",
            "It works at at room temperature.",
            "I mean it.",
            "It's definitely.",
            "I mean, it's one of the technologies that's being pursued for.",
            "For MRAM there is again the dissipation to switch the magnet or the free layer itself is not odd at large.",
            "However, you have to drive the currents right and you have you have resistances in the leads and you need.",
            "External circuitry, but I think this is where the MRAM community is is moving towards at this point so.",
            "OK, some other questions.",
            "I suppose switching energy goes more than linearly with the temperature, so the future will be in cry of physics.",
            "I mean, certainly if you can go to lower temperatures, all of the energies go down, the maggots become more stable.",
            "The applications are really with this, limiting that you if you if you for consumer applications it's hard to see this kind of prior applications.",
            "However if you are interested in say a larger scale computer.",
            "Word that end these issues of cooling are not so important anymore and there are there's definitely interest in in in cooling, cooling, inquire for applying cryo physics for these studies problems, absolutely.",
            "OK.",
            "He got.",
            "So this is really fascinating.",
            "What you have shown.",
            "Now my question is, how fast are these magnets?",
            "How fast can you switch them and how fast does it propagate?",
            "And it's a very good point.",
            "Of course, you know that our friends in the semiconductor industry have exactly the same kind of questions, so typical switching fields of these magnets let let me say in general speed is not one of the advantages here, so this is not going to be faster than electronics.",
            "The main advantage really comes through power, lower power, lower standby power.",
            "So these these magnets switch and we we don't have experiments yet where you can show switching off the logic gates.",
            "But on NS roughly, so we think that these kinds of structures work on the order of hundreds of megahertz, right?",
            "Which is not terrific for computation, right?",
            "But it is not terrible either.",
            "We think that some of the advantages, so I don't think that something like that is going to be a general purpose computer.",
            "I think that something like that might be a coprocessor that does some functions very efficiently, and so you know a computer.",
            "Essentially has very few or very few transistors are used for actually crunching the data.",
            "Most of their transistors are being used to get the data in and out right.",
            "And so this kind of technology would not be very good in getting data in and out, and so I think this might map onto structures, data structures which are very computation intensive.",
            "You know, like systolic arrays, where we have said like linear race and where you pump data through for image processing applications, and so those are exactly the cancellations that our friends in computer and computer engineers are looking at.",
            "But this is a very good very good question.",
            "OK, thank you some further questions you talk about nanostructure so very small dimensions, several 10s of nanometers.",
            "So maybe while we're fabricating these structures, there is an error in publication, and you mentioned that we dream about nanostructures of 1 billion of logic elements.",
            "So are these structures completely reliable because there may be some errors when Publicated solves most structures.",
            "It's a very good question or so and that's also where our industrial sponsors are pushing us, so we are also looking into characterizing the error rates that definitely are errors.",
            "You cannot solve.",
            "We see errors occur in when the lines are longer than say 10 magnets below 10 magnets.",
            "The error rates are very very small actually.",
            "So 10 is not very large when they're interested in say, trillion transistors, right?",
            "However, 1010 magnets switching at one time, so you need to come up with a clocking footprints.",
            "You know which weather the path for sort of 1 computation is on the order of 10 magnets.",
            "And so again, this goes into finding applications where you organize your information such that we Switch 10 at a time, and you Switch 10 at the time you don't switch in a million at the time.",
            "If you switch a million at the time is sort of hopeless, right?",
            "But if you can segment it into into smaller pieces and again this goes into into the into computer engineering, computer science issues.",
            "OK. Also very very good point.",
            "Thank you.",
            "I see no further questions, so I would like to thank Professor product.",
