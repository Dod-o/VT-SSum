            "So I'm going to be talking about this work we did with a number of museums and that element talks lessons learned in building linked data for the American Art Collaborative.",
            "And as you see, there are quite a few collaborates here.",
            "Many of these are from USC, including a number of students that work in this project, but also so many of these authors are actually participants from the various museums that were involved in the project."

            "OK, so the project goal was to launch this American Art Collaborative, which is this consortium of 14 American art museums and the goal of the project was to explore the use of link data.",
            "To make the museum data available for other people, to do research with education and outreach for the museums.",
            "And really, there's a tremendous amount of interest from the Cultural Heritage community, especially from the museum and library communities.",
            "In terms of exploiting Link data as a means of actually making their data available there very excited about it, and you know, there's quite a bit of momentum to actually do this, so we participated and helped form this consortium to essentially build this high quality link data.",
            "So we wanted to create.",
            "Which is called 5 star link data for the museums and this involved mapping the data about the artwork.",
            "An artist to some common ontology linking the data to other resources and then you know it's sort of a medical which is creating and extending the tools to support this construction of data to make it as easy as possible to be able to create link data datasets and then finally to be able to create applications on top of the data to do interesting things with.",
            "OK, so here's the outline.",
            "My talk.",
            "I'm going to 1st talk about the process of X."

        [
            "Mapping the data, then linking the entities and finally using the link data, and I'll conclude with some related work and discussion.",
            "Alright, so first mapping the data so it's worth noting that this was probably the most challenging part of the project.",
            "This had to do with the fact that the museums had data in wildly different formats.",
            "They each have their own collection management systems.",
            "They were very limited in terms of what forms they could produce the data in, so we had a huge range of data both in terms of the type of information, the structure of the information, and even the underlying schema that they were using to publish it.",
            "The second part of the challenge was that in the Cultural Heritage community, there's a, you know, a strong push to use the this ontology, called the See Docs, ERM Ontology which has evolved over the years, and there's been a tremendous amount of work put into this ontology to make it very comprehensive, and as a result, it's a very large and very complicated ontology, and we had a number of psyduck serum experts actually involved in this project working with us, which perhaps made the challenge even more complicated for us.",
            "So in our approach to addressing this overall problem was first we had to deal with just a tremendous amount of data from the museums and a large number of sort of mappings of this data.",
            "So we decided early on to use GitHub to basic organize all of this data.",
            "That turned out to be a very wise choice, and as many of you know, we've been working on a tool over the years called Karma that is very good at sort of taking datasets and mapping them to a demand intelligent generating this set of mappings for that data, which is exactly we needed to do here.",
            "So we use karma to create the mappings for each of the datasets and then finally, since this is a rather large project and we didn't necessarily have time to do this ourselves, we trained a team of USC students to basically take these tools and apply them.",
            "Well, actually both build and apply the different tools to actually create these datasets.",
            "So so the first thing was."

        [
            "You know, applying karma to use this so.",
            "I'm already existent amount of work to before this project, but this project really was a great sort of use case for us to really push on the technology and stuff.",
            "So this is a image of karma.",
            "It's just a screenshot of the tool and as you can see at the bottom of the image there, there's a snapshot of some of the data.",
            "Here's some statistics on the actual data set itself in each column, and then at the top is the actual mapping or model that actually gets produced that actually describes the data.",
            "And I realize you probably can't see the details of that, and that's not so important.",
            "Yeah, but what karma does for you is it essentially allows you to load in each of the datasets.",
            "In any of these different formats that we had to work with and then allows you to interactively essentially do the mapping of the data to this domain ontology and one of the key things here is that Karma uses some machine learning tools under the hood to essentially make this mapping process as easy and simple as possible, and essentially tries to automate the process as you go, and in this process you know in this project we basically extended karma in several ways.",
            "One was we.",
            "Made it more interactive so you probably can't see, but all these little red dots there are things you can actually click on in the modeling process to sort of allow the user to visually interactively model the data, and karma is always making recommendations in each of these steps in the process.",
            "And the other thing we did in this in this project was essentially to extend Karma to automatically publish all of the data directly into GitHub, which turned out to be very useful since it was a lot of data in a lot of models or mappings that we had to publish.",

            "And so we went through a long process here.",

            "Even the experts wouldn't always agree on which way to map the data, so the target mapping was a huge innovation here and then.",
            "One of the things this is built into a tool where it shows you the target mapping and then on the left side.",

        [
            "Here, so the first one was that we wanted we really found it extremely useful to design the system in such a way that there were reproducible workflows, meaning that you allow the museums to export the raw data in whatever format they wanted to export the raw data, and this is very useful because they kept having to iterate and generate new datasets, right?",
            "We discovered that oh, they didn't give us this data set or there was some other piece of information missing, or any variety of reasons.",
            "So we went through multiple iterations and so having a reproducible workflow is extremely useful.",
            "Second, was this using the shared repository for the data, so I'll play.",
            "Using GitHub essentially as this place where the museums would actually publish their data, and then we would publish the results of all the work that we did back into the GitHub so that everyone could actually see it, and so you can go there and actually look at that.",
            "And that turned out to be extremely effective way to organize.",
            "You know when you essentially had 99 mappings for the different datasets.",
            "Third one was that you know data cleaning was a huge significant part of the effort and is part of Karma.",
            "You're able to actually include these operations directly into the workflows so that it's essentially documented and is part of something that is repeatable.",
            "So that worked out extremely well.",
            "The 4th one, and I think this probably was perhaps the most important lesson one we didn't start with and probably spent a year on the project that could have been considerably reduced.",
            "Which was, you know, dealing with these mapping inconsistencies and, you know in this I think is a really important point, because it turns out that even though it may appear that the ontology is extremely well defined and everyone should be able to agree on how the data is mapped, that often is not the case, and so having this validation tool that essentially provides sort of the target mappings in a way to actually then run the queries against the data to verify the target mappings done.",
            "Was a huge time saving in terms of doing it in the project.",
            "You know, we once we figured out that OK, we need to use these target mappings.",
            "We got a group of six or seven students together for about 2 weeks and they basically re mapped all the data.",
            "You know project that we have been doing for a year and then finally that you know it's not completely solved when you have these target mappings 'cause there's still these small sort of subtle differences in terms of the mapping process and so it turned out that an expert review of the data was extremely useful.",
            "I actually resisted this, 'cause I knew would be more work, but then when they did it I said, well, this is really important because.",
            "There were several things about you know which field they actually used to create a urri because you know that's not a field that would actually maintain stable.",
            "Some things you know that that you just need to know both about maybe the ontology and perhaps the domain that was extremely effective.",

        [
            "King the data.",
            "So here the goal was to essentially link the entities in the museums to other resources, and we wanted to create the capability for the museums to actually be able to curate the automatically generated links, because unlike many other sort of data sets out there that people have published in the museums really really care that the data that they publish is correct.",
            "So as a demonstration of this, we took all of the artists across all the museums and essentially link them to the Getty You Land, which is the Getty List of artist names.",
            "And and this actually in doing this I mean first we tried to use some of the existing tools and there were two problems that came up.",
            "One was either they wouldn't scale because we're linking to data sets were extremely large, or the second problem was that they were just really complicated to use and students had a hard time getting them to configure.",
            "Getting them properly configured.",
