            "Professor and I said, well, I didn't know that that was before my time, OK?",

            "OK, so there is a question with Monopoly, you lose competition, you lose innovation.",

            "Alright, so there are a lot of very very tough questions here.",

            "Yes.",

            "There were blogs, all those kind of things were around before, but when Facebook came out it kind of brought it all together for people.",
            "Put it in one place, one interface, and it added discovery there as well.",

            "Well, I don't think that this will be 80 billion dollar company if that's what you think.",
            "If it you know I agree with you.",
            "But on the other hand, I think it is.",
            "It is an anomaly.",
            "I don't think that we need to have companies that actually owned that kind of a data and serving it.",
            "You know an owning and doing whatever they want with it.",
            "But one thing that is interesting is the compare.",
            "For example a search engine with Facebook.",
            "When you have a search engine, you're providing the intent that you are looking for something, and it turns out that there is even more money today on the you know on serving ads when you are capturing it at the search level.",
            "OK, so this jury is still out on where this money is, but but I certainly think of course Facebook is big, but.",
            "So is SMS.",
            "OK, SMS is very big right now.",
            "Of course SMS is on its decline in a sense because it is holding 2 onto an old system.",
            "But the fact that people need to message each other without being friends is important, I think.",
            "But So what we're trying to do with Musubi is to ride the the shift from SMS to more of a IP based.",
            "You know, more you know.",
            "With what you can do with the smartphones multimedia, an apps and so forth, and I think that if you think about SMS, I don't think that there is a reason to believe that this may not catch on just because that's as you know, if it is even more universal than Facebook in a sense.",
            "But I don't want to make that, I don't.",
            "I think it is if we, if we all work together and we do it right, there should be no one company that has that kind of power.",
            "And make that kind of money.",
            "And like I said before, I'm collecting a lot of data I can actually work with advertising.",
            "So what was interesting also is that we and advertising company came to us.",
            "And I said, why are you talking to me?",
            "I'm interested in privacy and what they said was interesting and they said look because of do not track.",
            "They are now beginning to pay attention to privacy and they think that if they if they neglect this area, people who can shut down their throats, something that that's worse, that has the privacy regulations in enforced.",
            "So there is some pushback we have started to see some pushback.",
            "And if what we're saying here is that there is a lot of data and I will.",
            "Give you a lower resolution data and you can still market to us.",
            "It's a different economy and it may work.",
            "But this is if there are more people concerned about privacy and there is also government regulations about what you can capture, then you know what we're proposing is a low is an infrastructure that has a lower cost?",
            "Alright?",
            "That's very important.",
            "It is very low cost if you look at it from a telecom communication telecom business point of view.",
            "They are already moving the messages around, but instead of sending it all to 1 server and then delivering it again, we're just making it more PTP, more scalable, a lot more local communication.",
            "And it is cheaper and it is better in that sense.",
            "So I think that we are shifting the economy.",
            "We don't have to.",
            "By the way there is, it is.",
            "It is too late to try to come up with another thing that looks like them.",
            "With that kind of economic.",
            "Incentives, and the only reason why I think we have a shot is that we are giving away something that Facebook will never give away and that is data.",
            "Otherwise they would just come and do everything that we're doing.",
            "So there is a big difference here.",
            "You can say we're going backwards, but I think that I think it is.",
            "Hopefully you know this is the beginning of social networking and the first thing that we've built are not particularly good for consumers.",
            "Remember the days of AOL?",
            "Alright, AOL was big.",
            "Everybody belongs to AOL.",
            "Where is what are they doing now?",
            "They cannot fight against the open Internet.",
            "Alright with a closed model they have to adopt it and that's what I'm appealing here to.",
            "Everybody is like let's build this open Internet for social.",
            "My name is Josh Mona I was I was like would like to challenge you on the notion that the kids don't care about privacy.",
            "I think I've not been researching this, but it seems to me like privacy is the future of like big society where we can hide in in in the masses.",
            "And of course the kids and their social network is so small that they cannot hide in the masses anymore.",
            "So their notion of privacy.",
            "Sort of is incomprehensible to our two to our generation.",
            "I would say what they seem to care about is an insane degree of granularity granularity.",
            "That picture should not be.",
            "It should only be shared with that person, and so it's it seems like their notion of privacy has changed radically, but they still have some kind of notion of privacy.",
            "It's just not our number for privacy and we come to that.",
            "Well, first of all, if that is true, I'm just so much happier.",
            "It's great if they do, but from what I have, you know when I talk to people and talk to the students, they just told me they don't care.",
            "And what is interesting is that we want to appeal to here.",
            "Here is an example of a marketing pitch.",
            "We're thinking about I don't know how many people have heard this phrase.",
            "Don't put him on Facebook.",
            "Alright, I take a picture like don't put it on Facebook.",
            "My hair is not pretty today.",
            "I'm not wearing the dress that I want and stuff like that.",
            "And the point here is that everybody is aware that once you post it up there, there might be other people you don't want to see.",
            "See this thing so it is an image problem.",
            "It's not a privacy problem, it's an image problem and we may be able to exploit that is like you just have fun and poke fun of each other.",
            "Put funny pictures on peoples faces and stuff like that.",
            "But you don't have to keep thinking with whether somebody can put your picture that you don't want on Facebook.",
            "So so there is a little bit of that going on that I have observed, and I hope to take advantage of it.",
            "Yes, my name is Finna Finnell's and I didn't understand the quite how the persistency of the data.",
            "So what happens if I lose my my mobile phone and do a lose all my data?",
            "And what happens if I do want to erase or delete, delete an embarrassing file?",
            "Am I able to do that or is the file already on another persons?",
            "Mobile phone and I kind of reached it there.",
            "So the first part is like you always have to back up your phone.",
            "Whether it is your, you know, the pictures that you take, you might have some.",
            "You must have some way to back up your phone because you can lose it anytime.",
            "So what we're saying is that there is no difference.",
            "Alright, I can.",
            "So one of the versions.",
            "I mean the the iPhone version today you have an option of backing all of that on drop box, but the important thing here is that there is a backup problem, but you get to pick what backup problem.",
            "If you want you can back it up onto onto your PC every time you do sync.",
            "Right, so we changed the problem, meaning that you communicate and then there is a backup problem.",
            "Now the second question is about delete.",
            "Our model is much more like email.",
            "When I send it to you, you know you got the copy.",
            "So what we heard from the kids is that they said I need to be able to delete, not because of the fact that I sent.",
            "I changed my mind, but because I made a mistake, I mistyped something.",
            "I just don't want it to show up on the other side.",
            "So we have added a delete another system.",
            "At all it does is it just doesn't show the picture or show the message if they want to.",
            "They can still find it, but that turns out to be enough to solve the social problem of deletions, but otherwise information out is information.",
            "Now there is no recall in that.",
            "Now what we do playing with is how do we send videos is that we took the retake the videos and we put it in what we call a corral.",
            "It's a temporary storage.",
            "This thing will go away within a thinking about a week.",
            "Alright, so if I take a video instead of nice to your phone and you may not actually want to look at the video because it's got more data on it, we put it in a temporary corral.",
            "We send you the link and now you can go click it, but if it expires or if I want to delete it then you will not be able to get access to it.",
            "So there is a little bit of that that can be worked into the system.",
            "Where do you claim I've two questions, one about the complexity of the information?",
            "Sorry.",
            "OK, that's alright.",
            "Complexity of the information.",
            "So we have many different kinds of information which depend in different ways on each other.",
            "Yes, messages you just want to send you to your family or to your colleagues and pictures.",
            "Yes, links etc.",
            "Do you think that normal people, not the computer nerds, but students or whatever are able to manage this complexity?",
            "We all send emails already to the wrong people.",
            "Subtypes with disasters as a consequence, is that something where you think that people can manage him or do you provide some support to manage it.",
            "So what we do right now is that you start to feet and you put some names in it and your friends could add more names to it, but you see who they are and they're a little bit more for you there.",
            "So there are two kinds of messaging.",
            "One is one shot alright, I just want you to do something and it just just like email and SMS.",
            "And the other one is actually it's very much like the SMS model.",
            "Once you establish a group, you can continue to grow that and, but we have.",
            "It's true.",
            "We have added the ability for people to also add to that group and it is.",
            "It is different.",
            "This is really not the place for you to publicly.",
            "Express yourself first of all, I really think that there is room for Facebook.",
            "I have a web page and my Stanford account all this time and I put my CV up and all that and publications and I think that Facebook should be used that way.",
            "OK, it is great for discovery that way, but there is no need for us to share everything.",
            "Your health, your your for kids to be.",
            "Share to be talking about chemistry and so forth.",
            "They don't need to also give up their right to their data.",
            "So that's the that's what we're going after.",
            "OK, so far so University of Montpelier, so we're talking about.",
            "About privacy monopoly economics an.",
            "And so.",
            "I wonder?",
            "So in your talk, you you so?",
            "These are very important topics an there are becoming so important that we are less talking about technical problems.",
            "So my question is like is computer science becoming more of a social science where we talk about social aspects of the thing less than technical problems?",
            "Well, you can look at my paper.",
            "We have a paper on how we build the egocentric social networks and so forth, and I think that it is.",
            "It is really the I. I mean.",
            "I've been in computer science for so long and it is really the first time that I can connect to the social world.",
            "I'm very excited about this.",
            "And there is still a lot of technical work to be done.",
            "I mean we there is a lot of access control issues when when the apps are sharing information with each other.",
            "And how do you control that?",
            "But my but my point here is that when you build a system, you have to start with something that met that matches what the users can absorb as a matter of fact, if I look at it from a technical perspective, we are building a distributed system all over again.",
            "In the name of feeds.",
            "Alright, and just think a little bit about all this technical work that we have done on distributed systems.",
            "Where did?",
            "Where is it?",
            "You know that those problems are hard and I have no question that we will this.",
            "There's a lot of system research in there, lots of semantic information inferencing distributed there is.",
            "This is, you know, this is the ultimate innocence distributed system research.",
            "But I think that in the past we focused not on how.",
            "Easy for people redeploy.",
            "You know, it's like I couldn't even know there are distributed file system that I couldn't even even install.",
            "OK, so there's a lot of systems work every time you get a new computer revolution you get a lot of research and the phones are here to this is the big one.",
            "OK, this might be the last big symbolic one, by the way, so get busy.",
            "Yeah, so I'm Rafael Trancey from your account here, so you're talking about decentralized semantic social networks and so this idea is incomplete.",
            "Resonance since a number of years, we've for example, Tim Berners Lee talks a lot about that within WP.",
            "See, you have a lot of standards that tries to fulfill this.",
            "This vision and you talk about doing that in an open way.",
            "So I was just wondering.",
            "How much standards do you comply with, such as web ID for the unification management, 4th process itself, or representing your contact lists so all those standards way of representing the informations 'cause it didn't talk too much about semantics.",
            "In your talk I talk about all the things that we spend a lot of time solving and there is no reason why you cannot adopt as many of those standards applicable like the activity script and so forth.",
            "They are all possible.",
            "We did something a little bit different on the identities because of the the.",
            "You know we have to make this app viral.",
            "People have been talking about standards for awhile and what we're focusing on is just to make something that potentially has a shot.",
            "And I also want to encourage to have as many people work on it.",
            "Working on standards is important, but we have to come up with something that has a shot.",
            "1st and that's what our focus is an I really, you know we're we talked to Tim Berners Lee and these are so.",
            "There are all these standard bodies that we can talk to.",
            "Group is relatively small and we are good with prototyping and maybe there are other people who can help so you know, I encouraged me.",
            "I'd love to have more conversations, but you know, we just need a lot of help.",
            "It's a very big problem so I just, you know, want it close by asking if there are people here who would be interested in using the software.",
            "Yes.",
            "Alright go download it.",
            "It is how many of you have need an iPhone version before you can use it.",
            "Is it the same head?",
            "How many people can use the Android version?",
            "Oh wow, this is good.",
            "This is already very good, so I know that you know we import all your friends, but none of your friends are on it so send me email.",
            "OK, I'm Lam at cs.stanford.edu and I can pick it up and maybe I can, you know get get this going.",
            "I think that there are a lot of interesting apps to be done with research and I hope to hear from you.",
            "Alright, thank you."
