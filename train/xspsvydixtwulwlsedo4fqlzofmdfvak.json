            "So the reason why we think it's probably a fair comparison to compare to blog posts is that you know they're sort of providing similar information.",
            "They are providing URLs that are new that are interesting, and they're also providing user commentary on those URLs.",

            "Even if you assume maybe that there are two or three times this in all of the social bookmarking systems.",

            "You know, maybe it's 60 million posts.",
            "Maybe it's 150 million posts an when you filter that down and make some make some assumptions, you end up with 10s of millions of unique URLs that are probably in the system and.",

            "Another question that we also want to know as opposed to just what the current size is, is how fast it's growing.",
            "So in these two scatter plots on the left and right side, we actually show the growth rate of of delicious.",
            "Said two different time periods.",

            "An increase of 30,000 to 90,000 posts per day, so it's tripling in that time period, so that's actually a pretty big increase, but if you then look at the subsequent period of about seven or eight months between November and July, November 2006 to July 2007, things are relatively stable.",
            "You're not seeing an acceleration in the number of posts per day.",

            "They may be really good.",
            "They may be really bad, but if something was searched for and we didn't find it, but then it was indexed later than our argument is that it is actually worth indexing.",

            "The other possibility is that web search is actually the source of these URLs, and so the reason that you're getting these.",

            "Evaluation on in about 1/6 of the cases the tag was actually in the title, so in this case that would mean oil prices might tag this, and that seems deeply problematic to us because, you know, search engines are already zone waiting titles and information retrieval systems have been sold.",

            "The title is the title suggests that all you have to do is just zone with the title, but if you're a search engine, you could probably pay somebody to label domains much more efficiently than you could get users to label these URLs for you, so this also seems problematic.",
            "The other four things are less problematic.",
            "The first one is that in 50% of the cases the tag is in the page text, so at the very least, this suggests that that tags are not totally divorced in terms of what content they have from the actual text of the page.",
