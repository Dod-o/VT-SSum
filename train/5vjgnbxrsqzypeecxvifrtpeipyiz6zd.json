            "That's findings for Group 2, then to Group three, yes, so we were talking about.",
            "Two things, basically, first is that all yours can be translated, but I think the first group issued this problem as well.",
            "That of course you can translate the oers, but it's important that you take the local context into consideration because you cannot just translate one thing and translate it into another language because the context might not be there, so you always have to take the local meanings and.",
            "Local positioning into into consideration, and I think the second thing that we talked about is the quality.",
            "Because if you want to produce so in our yard that's sold in in less spoken language, let's use language.",
            "The number of coworkers and help that you can get this fire lower than it would.",
            "It would it be that if you would produce in in English, because if you produce an odr in English, you can basically get coworkers that are interested in the same things.",
            "All around the world, but if you're producing methane Slovenian, you can only do those things with people that are fluent in Slovenian language.",
            "In order to create an audience completely insulated, just living on language.",
            "Thank you so far.",
            "I would just sum it up in three key words before going to group #4 and that is a translation translation.",
            "Cultural adaptation.",
            "And at last I could summarize the need for collaboration.",
            "OK, last group to answer my previous observation on low quality of resources in smaller languages.",
            "Maybe maybe the openness of these resources and the collaboration is the key thing to to hold the quality standard of open resources so.",
            "This might just be me agreeing with your title.",
            "And it's a general observation.",
            "No policy recommendations from me.",
            "OK, thank you.",
            "We have now almost come to an end.",
            "But before ending this workshop I will open up for a general debate on or findings here.",
            "New issues that you want to bring up that you forgot about in the 1st place and if any of you have you know, suggestions for policy issues that really should be put forward will be very happy to receive that before going into that, you know I drove 3 squares.",
            "And my point, doing that is the inner square with which is the black one.",
            "That is to illustrate policy for less used languages.",
            "And that square in green up on the left side that is illustrating the need for policies for OR on the European level.",
            "So it's overlapping, but it's not the same.",
            "And then the red is like policies for or in broad globally.",
            "So that's just we are on the black one.",
            "That was what I wanted to say.",
            "We're on the black one, right?",
            "OK, I open up the floor.",
            "Anyone want to take the floor to comment on our findings?",
            "Or yes, please?",
            "I think that there someone shittier in CDA with natives.",
            "National navies that promote the user for the development of our yard.",
            "It will be useful and.",
            "Will help to.",
            "To keep the all this record.",
            "Activities around the world and to keep synchronized with all these activities.",
            "And it will be very helpful for the lesser used languages.",
            "For example, in Greek, where running initiative for the higher educations and they open courseware.",
            "But the proposal and will try to convince the teachers to open their material and to give a free whole population.",
            "So so could I translate that into that incentives for faculty to open up is important in the less used languages, countries, right incentives for teachers, OK?",
            "Other want to take the floor?",
            "It's now or another at this workshop at least.",
            "Perhaps this is actually taking a step backwards, but we've taken as sort of a premise of this session that less used languages ought to be preserved.",
            "And perhaps it's obvious, but anytime you're working on advocating for policy, it's important to define why why it's a problem, why we need to solve this problem.",
            "So God, I was wondering if you could say a few words about why this issue is important to you.",
            "Yeah, I think that is very good question and I try to formulate it little earlier on the slides and that is to reflect what is the consequences.",
            "For education outs equality in education if you reduce.",
            "The resources on your own languages.",
            "And I think findings that are generally agreed by now is that quality will be lowered.",
            "That is defining said people that are educated in within their own languages, and more important, the younger you are will have better chances later.",
            "Very simple, I think that is generally agreed.",
            "And you know we would like to say it's it goes without saying, right?",
            "That so I think that is one thing that necessarily doesn't go for all 40,000 languages, right?",
            "Because there is a balance if you are not capable of producing learning materials that the right quality.",
            "You know?",
            "Should you?",
            "What is important then?",
            "In relation to education, I think that could be heavily discussed and it is also both what is.",
            "The reach of that language, I think that again, what goes without saying in this context is that the focus we have here is national languages.",
            "Even we say that also minority languages should be reflected on the main focus is national languages.",
            "So you have to be on a certain size, like Slovenia for example.",
            "Or it could be Iceland with 300,000, or you know.",
            "So there are many languages that are in that group.",
            "So it is only like 5% of those 7000 languages is still alive.",
            "You know that in or about certain size that will survive anyway.",
            "And many of them them do not have or are in our base at this moment, and those 5% right?",
            "So the assumption is that the quality will be lower than you can ask what is the consequences for the language is itself if.",
            "The Resource for education is lowered and you have less education in your own language and what the standard consequences for that language, and I think it general assumption again, would be that.",
            "That language richness would be weakened.",
            "You don't know anything whether it will die or not, but for surely it will not develop that well as when it is used heavily in education.",
            "I think that also general assumption that it has a good research base without giving any sighting or anyone.",
            "So so that is to issue.",
            "And then of course you can post other questions.",
            "What about innovation?",
            "I think the reason is again an assumption that people that are capable of speaking their own language which they you know are very good at.",
            "And they know all type of intrigues that comes with that language, right?",
            "They are foreseen to be more creative than people that have a more simple language.",
            "Because they have a huge capacity to imagine all types of things and express it in written and oral format.",
            "So that is another aspect so.",
            "If it is like that, we are will be.",
            "Important part of educational resources and how we educate people?",
            "Then those assumptions become important, but if not we are becomes important.",
            "Well.",
            "Let's see, right?",
            "But that is, I think, a little longer answer on your question.",
            "So the floor is open.",
            "My observation about the oil impact over here on minor languages that I think that the when we look at the current situation of the world, I think that the educational impact of the O ER itself is quite limited.",
            "When we think of the.",
            "Maybe television problems.",
            "Lots of the problem from the United States already already invading a lot of minor countries so that from the point of view, I think that the impact educational resources so has a not so much influences on their minor languages, but but more important things that I think that if the oil is going to be adapted to different minor languages.",
            "In that case I think there should be some of the design guideline of these OE are open educational resources which should be take taking care of the cultural differences or the.",
            "Other kind of things, maybe religious differences so that well, if there exists some kind of the design guideline of the widely adaptable open educational resources, and if the education resources designed based on these guidelines adaptation will be much easier and also that adaptation itself be much, I think that easier and also efficient, so I'm not sure whether any researchers were instituted thinking of developing this kind of design guidelines, but.",
            "There should be some kind of design guideline.",
            "That's my observation.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thank you.",
            "The floor is still open for any.",
            "Last comments, will just continue on on the observation of the colleague here I think also important people who design or are seen this major languages that they design them in a way that it is easier to translate them into minor languages.",
            "So this means like choosing the right.",
            "Technology is open technologies, so they are easier translatable.",
            "And this kind of helps translating this resources into other languages.",
            "Thank you, it seems that we know go to the end of this workshop and we have had a development from starting with the paradox of Ovr that on one hand the magic is in the widely distribution and adaptation and on the other hand that might leave some challenges to smaller languages.",
            "Let's speak languages.",
            "So that is, I think that is fine.",
