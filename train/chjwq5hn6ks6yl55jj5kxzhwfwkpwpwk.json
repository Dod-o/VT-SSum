            "And So what?",

            "OK, they can't see it's a perfect lens, and these eyes in the box jellyfish they point towards the water surface.",
            "Anna, stop what they're doing is they're surveying the terrestrial landscape above the water surface to navigate within the riverbanks to find places where its prey usually hangs, hangs out which is along the just the shore that doesn't want to be in the middle of everyone's feeling the shore, so it uses visual systems sort of ascertain where am I in riverbank in the River and then sort of move towards the bank.",
            "OK, so these are these are all highly evolved systems and very very intelligent designs.",
