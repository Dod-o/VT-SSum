            "So what happens is that people are lined with technology and organization and if you look at knowledge management in areas like educational Sciences, educational science is concerned with modifying people.",

            "You have the author, administrator, and the type resource page and navigation.",
            "Tree.",
            "And then you have incoming regulations from the front page that I have from which I navigated here, so the reference boxes is a way of visualizing the RDF store, and actually it's quite helpful to be able to navigate back to pages that link to the current page.",
            "This is possible in quickly because ikiwiki stores, annotations, and relations separately from the wiki text, which can be can also be a drawback, but that's one of the differences from Semantic Mediawiki.",
            "OK, so that's basically.",
            "The layout then we have here different.",
            "Possibilities to do certain things with the content you can discuss about it at a new discussion item.",
            "You have a rich text editor.",
            "And post it and I hope it works.",
            "One of my colleagues said it wasn't working, but it seems to be working through.",
            "Um?",
            "You can have.",
            "You can edit the text.",
            "What you can see here is again, it uses a rich text editor, but there was also in the same wiki workshop in 2006 there was a talk by someone from India, Sophia Antipolis.",
            "I think Michelle BFA and he he he was referring to a study that people don't accept rich text editors in wikis, and we started to think about that and.",
            "Basically, the point why they're not accepting it is that it interrupts their way of using the wiki, and this is mainly for links because when you have to enter a link in a rich text editor you have to click on the button which opens a popup window and then you have to enter the link and then click on OK again.",
            "That's not the way you want to edit in wikis and what we did is we addressed this by adding by having your rich text editor but using the same syntax as it's used in media.",
            "Key and then converting it to.",
            "Links.",
            "But you can use it like you can even cut and paste from word and it keeps the formatting.",
            "So that's a nice feature about that.",
            "You also have the history.",
            "Which is basically the same as.",
            "As in other systems.",
            "I can show you what it does, no it cannot, why not?",
            "So there's so this is a better version.",
            "It it has some some issues.",
            "What the system also makes the system also different.",
            "You might have noticed it from my presentation is that pages are stored in XML and not in wiki syntax, because Wiki Syntaxes Mediawiki syntax is really nasty.",
            "It's basically defined by a PHP regular expression processor.",
            "There's no other way of defining the syntax, and since we implemented it in Java, it was very hard to re implement this syntax.",
            "So we just said we drop it.",
            "Snow, no use doing it in the internal representation for PPS XML and this has very has several advantages.",
            "You can easily transform it to different formats.",
            "You can export and import it easily.",

            "Yes.",
            "Users propose XLT Transformers on the client side.",
            "Did you consider that option or no?",
            "No, that browsers proposed this, but I have some concerns, for example about security because then you are transferring all data to the client.",
            "But maybe your Accessibility strategy on purpose leaving something out that is not meant for the client to see.",
            "And also.",
            "Not all browsers supported.",
            "OK, and then now we are into meta data.",
            "That's something I show you in the use case.",

            "And it basically contains some pages for from the biology domain.",
            "From Wikipedia, one is about the bilberry.",
            "And the bilberry, as you can read the name that is given to species of shrubs in the genus Vaccinium.",
            "So what you can see is in the text it says is the species.",
            "So what you could do in equivocates, you annotate this page, annotate, annotate, view, just differ slightly from the normal view.",
            "In that you get here plus and minus signs and behind below the page.",
            "Here we have a part that says that says types, so these are the types that are associated with the resource that is represented by this page.",
            "And then you have plus and minus signs behind each of the links.",
            "So.",
            "What I now do is that I add to the bilberry the type species because the text reads it is a species and I can do this by clicking clicking on plus in it, but it does is it offers me all the.",
            "All the classes that are stored in the in the ontologies that have been loaded into the wiki, so that's also something that is considerably different from Semantic Mediawiki becausw.",
            "Ikiwiki heavily boots on the ontologies that are built that are already loaded into the knowledge base.",
            "There cannot be an inconsistent quicky system because the system use interface does not allow it.",
            "It just offers things that have been defined that somehow contradictory to the Wiki way.",
            "In a certain aspect, because the Wiki way is meant to be free and open, but on the other hand, it ensures that things are.",
            "Always consistent, and that's something that you mentioned is important for in enterprise contexts, and you can still modify the classes.",
            "You can add new classes in new properties as you like, just the first need to be defined before you can add new information.",
            "OK, now I say this is a species.",
            "It's been added.",
            "And what also has been added is that it's.",
            "More that so, the reason it has inferred.",
            "But since it's a species, it's also other things.",
            "So it's a concept in the CC work.",
            "Because someone in the system has probably defined that species is a subclass of CC work.",
            "We can check this easily by clicking on the species.",
            "So the species is.",
            "Mother's up.",
            "There's something wrong here.",
            "Ontology editing seems not to work.",
            "OK, Buck.",
            "OK, we cannot check it, but we should have checked here.",
            "Subclass of here is so it is a subclass of CC work which we can see in the outgoing links.",
            "So usually as I mentioned, this is a better version that contains some changes, some significant changes, and probably someone.",
            "Maybe myself dropped the path that would allow ontology editing, so normally you have below this types in for a class you would have subclasses and.",
            "For properties you would have range in domain and inverse OK Anyways.",
            "Basic functionality is still there, so OK, I added the type bio species to billbury.",
            "Now I.",
            "Also wants to associate with the link to vaccinium that this means that this is in the genus Vaccinium, so behind Vaccinium.",
            "I have again A plus.",
            "And if I click on it, it immediately offers me Bio has genus based on the fact that the system knows that it is a species and the system knows that Vaccinium is a genius, so there's only certain relations that that are applicable, applicable and it only offers those.",
            "And I must admit that it shows Bio has geniuses just because it starts with being the first in the alphabet.",
            "So there are other ones that could be applicable.",
            "One of them is full of phone, which I find very interesting and I always show it in my demos because it's a good example for an underspecified ontology, and you have you simply have such things, so you cannot always rely on good ontologies.",
            "So there needs to be a way of.",
            "Of ordering these things in a way that that is more precise.",
            "OK, if I now add bio has genus.",
            "To this.",
            "Link then I would have the minus.",
            "I could click on the minus and it would offer me the relation that I just added.",
            "I don't want to remove it, but what I wanted to show you is the instant benefit and now I go back to articulate.",
            "The instant benefit is that it automatically generates a taxonomy box and this it can do by by reasoning over the knowledge base 'cause it now knows that it's in the genus Vaccinium and it knows that Vaccinium is in the family area care and it knows that this family is part of.",

            "Peter will be partly doing.",
            "OK, so that was one example.",
            "I have more demos.",
            "I'll start with the multimedia demo because I think it was one of the questions for Semantic Mediawiki as well as what to do with images.",

            "If you like to try out under our supervision.",
            "The systems I have ikiwiki installations here on DVD.",

            "And Apache is also on it and processes on.",
            "So you could install it if you would like if you like to and if your technical person if you are not a technical person it's maybe.",

            "Experience is that it simply hides boxes.",
            "So for example, someone who is not familiar with ontologies, he wouldn't get the edit box or he wouldn't get the annotate mode for annotating.",
            "Is that?",
            "Plus mythology class, then I can present it to some biologists in some other way rather than for example, that's that's something that is planned for.",
            "Actually, I want to completely hide this annotate box from people that are not not ontologists.",
            "But depending on the experience but the problem with this presentation is it's basically an RDF editor, not much more, and RDF is for people like us.",
            "It's no problem, but if I present this to my colleague who is doing even management, she gets upset.",
            "So this combined with, for example semantic forms is Danny has presented it with semantic forms.",
            "Such people could easily add meter data without without even noticing that they're doing it.",

            "You mean complex concepts from owl?",
            "Yes becausw yes because they are basically.",
            "They're basically clauses in all is well, but they are listed.",
            "Here is an anonymous I had once syntax that used the description logics syntax, but it's also not very applicable to users.",
            "So here you have for example.",

            "Not really well supported.",
            "So the point about being able to use it is you can import and export these things, and they're also somehow it's no problem with the pages annotated with such a thing, but it's not convenient to do it yourself.",
            "And the system also does not enforce such numerical restrictions, so reasoning is only limited, currently limited basically to ahrefs, plus inverse plus yeah.",
            "You said about different levels, yeah?",
            "Yes, but this yeah yes yes.",
            "I just would like to add school.",
            "Role based.",
            "Presentation or changes or changes of presentation according to user background.",
            "There are two views on that basically so one possibility, which is a bit easier and it's probably realizable within certain timeframe, is that it will be based on frames or on face at Scituate and certain places you can hide in certain places on the interface.",
            "You can show according to user profile and depending depending on how you do it right, so how the profile will look like, whether you have just two stereotypes, they have more stereotypes or you have individualized customization, right?",
            "Another quite interesting topic, though a bit more difficult, is to adapt the descriptions and text, but for that we would need to understand natural language a bit better and we would have to adapt how how?",
            "This is very common and there is a little bit more difficult than because that was about, well, you mentioned that to other presentation of knowledge according to different people who are open but well.",
            "If we take the knowledge is everything which is inside the box.",
            "Then you need to understand the natural language, even if it is just about the face.",
            "It's then it's a bit easier, right?",
            "Biologist is not only important to see.",
            "National language.",
            "Properly presented also this information if they collaboratively developing yes, but yeah, so The thing is rather than having a permission system that forbids things, it's rather about having a role based system where you just if you if your role is biologist then you get primarily the textual information, but you still have it still not forbidden for you to access the other information.",
            "And as a more experienced user, you might have a different user interface that presents primarily.",
            "For example the annotations or whatever.",

            "Yeah.",
