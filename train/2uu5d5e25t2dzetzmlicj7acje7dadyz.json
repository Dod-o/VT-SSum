            "We should be able to send things over and see what it performs.",
            "I mean, we're definitely looking for collaborations and trying to see what needs to be done to improve.",
            "That's what we're looking at, yeah?",
            "Thank you.",
            "Which presentations on Livraison a question?",

            "Methods.",
            "Narratives with matchless computational fluid dynamics.",
            "There are two things at this stage.",
            "I mean, first thing I must admit that we have not gone into fluids as yet.",
            "I mean, this is just a temperature fear for the CNN, it is using a rectangular template.",
            "But yes, we anticipate that it will be going for either meshless or.",
            "I mean you can call it point collocation or whatever.",
            "I mean basically irregular mesh kind of structures, but we have not really taken Arsene into that phase yet.",
            "Yes, mother.",
            "So actually I have a number of questions.",
            "I agree with what you said then my own experience.",
            "Also, surrogate models work best when they're not urgently needed perfect.",
            "You didn't mention and I know you've done it, but my vantage of most humble or surrogates can also be that by estimating the variance in the sample, you can have a kind of like a additional estimate for the Fidelity of the surrogate models, sure.",
            "Sure, sure.",
            "So far interesting what you said about the trans dimensional approach, because I assume that fits very well into the idea of adapter for Presentations.",
            "In this line Republicans.",
            "Which is maybe theoretically, practically not such an issue theoretically.",
            "Death penalty for any other representation translation and by using it up adaptivity, changing faces, search dimension is amazing, yeah.",
            "Sure, I mean, that's that's.",
            "That's precisely the point.",
            "I mean when I say the models, there are a couple of differences, though I mean, the first is, in your case a number of control point changes.",
            "So does XY and Z for those peers.",
            "So you've got a larger string for concept.",
            "We have looked into.",
            "There are certain variables which can be made use of, so that becomes a really tricky issue because some part of the variable space you are ready to make use of in your future offsprings.",
            "Some of them you have to let go.",
            "So that those kind of problems will be far more challenging, but at this stage what we have is again a simulated handling based scheme and simulated annealing by itself.",
            "Having a single point has all set of problems for even many objective or multi objective formulations.",
            "Wondering if in this.",
            "Research you've ever kind of succeeded, reducing the parameters because one thing we have never met.",
            "We also tried to freeze, for example popular presentations, but with notoriously difficult to reduce.",
            "It's easy because you can mutually change the number of control points and any standardization, so you can increase it, but reducing it isn't very significant hip, no, I understand your point, but further examples that we have dealt with.",
            "I mean, we explicitly knew what are the number of models possible.",
            "OK, and the algorithm was probabilistically assigning resources.",
            "I fully agree to your point that you have gone in for higher representation accuracy or number of control points.",
            "But there could be pruning approaches.",
            "I mean, just like MLP training.",
            "Is just a possibility, but we haven't at this stage.",
            "Looked into it, yes?",
            "Yes, right, yeah.",
            "I think it's very interesting.",
            "I was just wondering.",
            "I mean, if you have 14 objectives, so in the end you're looking for a 13 dimensional space representation.",
            "Yes, if you're talking about what I meant over there is.",
            "If you have a 14 objective problem and randomly created population, all hundred solutions are going to be non dominant.",
            "Level on the practical implication would mean you would have to in the end if, let's say, your optimization argument is successful, then you would in the end neither representation over 13 dimensional space, probably no.",
            "It has to be.",
            "Say for example details at problems which are nothing but is here I mean details at 5 problems will have basically a part of sphere which has got three OK But there are degenerative problems where although the number of objectives even for details said you would notice that one of the test functions has got a 2D, although it's a three objective problem, the final character is a curve.",
            "That means it's basically a cut like this.",
            "So as you progress you'll get a curve, and if you're trying to do corner search which we struggle for sometime.",
            "Identifying the number of corners or a priori telling the number of corners is not a trivial issue.",
            "And you will get to see quite serious benefits.",
            "I mean, it has been stuck for quite awhile and people tried using different schemes.",
            "Nothing seems to be doing much other than infeasible driving.",
            "I mean again for constraint problems if it is unconstrained, there's nothing much can be done.",
            "But with this approach that we have now, at least we're able to get it.",
            "The true dimensionality of the front much earlier.",
            "And once you've got the dimensionality and the corner points, it is possible for you to now go for a reference direction based scheme and I'll get your point.",
            "Uniformly distributed within that.",
            "I think a couple of months or Max off in here you should be able to see that.",
