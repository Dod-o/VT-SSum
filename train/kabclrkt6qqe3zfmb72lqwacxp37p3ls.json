            "So what is going to happen is?",
            "And OK, so this slide doesn't cover all of the all of the settings, but many of them, so maybe so we start with the data set were given some data, or we might also have not have data points, but similarities between data or distances.",

            "And I think most of you know this toy picture, but maybe I explained it because some people might not know it, so it's just the idea.",
            "I mean, it's really a toy picture.",
            "And of course it doesn't say everything.",

            "The point is not that we draw subsamples, but the point is we need to get a second date or we need to repeat it.",
            "We want to repeatedly run our algorithms on datasets which are similar to the one we already have.",

            "Even so, some people here they take the original data set, but then instead of resampling, they simply add noise to the data points and they do this repeatedly and then use the noisy datasets to cluster as a basis for clustering.",

            "It's difficult anyway, so why not just use a random projection and generate different datasets in a low dimensional space and then cluster this low dimensional data set?",
            "And surprisingly, even in a model based framework, some people use the ability for selecting the number of clusters and what they then do is they sample that they like the estimated model parameters, and then they sample data from the model somehow.",

        [
            "Just what people do.",
            "And that's already.",
            "Here is a very important point I think, and maybe it goes a bit into the direction of what Carl actually said.",
            "So if you generate those artificial datasets, of course there's a tradeoff.",
            "I mean, if you.",
            "You change your data set so much that or if like if you add noise and you add so much noise that annoys completely, destroys the structure for which you're looking, then of course stability won't tell you anything about whether you select the right number of clusters or not.",
            "So if you if your changes are too heavy somehow, it won't work.",
            "On the other side, if you don't add too much changes to your data set, so if you only a very little bit of noise, or you subsample using N -- 1 data points or so, your results of course will always be more or less the same because it really didn't change your data set.",
            "So somehow there's a tradeoff.",
            "Of course somehow it's, and I think that.",
            "It's very important and this has not been really looked into how you could.",
            "What the threshold is, how much noise, or how much change do we need to introduce in our data set in order to make sure that stability actually does the correct thing?",
            "Yeah, for the number of clusters, social actually did something about that.",
            "So he what he showed us in the large sample limit.",
            "If you choose fewer than I think squared of N data points, it will always be stable.",
            "And if you choose more it will.",
            "Well then other issues occur, but but for example, yeah, but I think it's still it's not.",
            "I mean, it's obvious if you only changed very, very few data points then it will be still stable, so I think that's not so surprising.",
            "But it's right here it is not obvious to me is that you could not use a leave one out type of procedure.",
            "Then the scale at which you have to measure stability is a much smaller scale, but it could nevertheless be be be sensitive to what you would like to do.",
            "To measure I mean I would be really really surprised because somehow I mean clustering tries to.",
            "OK, of course we now have the problem.",
            "What is clustering?",
            "But somehow clustering tries to discover structure like pretty large structure in your data set and if you just change one data point, I mean like if you have a data set of 1000 points and it contains 2 clear clusters and you just remove one data point in at another data point.",
            "Changing one data point will still be dominated by fluctuations which are the same, and that's why yes.",
            "So somehow you need to add more noise in order to so somehow you.",
            "How should I say that?",
            "Why question other outlier in sense?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Insensitive to one on fire, then we leave one out.",
            "You are not affected at all.",
            "It's true, so I mean many algorithms.",
            "I mean, you have all this concentration, inequality, business where you show if you change one data point, the result is more or less still the same.",
            "So changing one data point simply doesn't affect like the algorithms built that way.",
            "But when you want to choose the parameters to do modern selection, you want to do it very efficiently, and running a first full scale and minus one point clustering is much more than one spend at this stage of your research.",
            "Maybe just want to their fast and dirty algorithm.",
            "That will tell you do they choose the right care so you don't want to run something on an order of 10 minutes.",
            "OK, I think that's still a different issue.",
            "Whether you're, I mean there's one issue, how could you do it in principle and then the other issue is how can you implement it in practice?",
            "OK, so that's just pointing out one problem we cut also wants to say something.",
            "At this point, what is clustering is something I have personal.",
            "OK, so we already.",
            "I know.",
            "I, I agree so.",
            "The only thing I can understand is it's a it's a compact representation of your data.",
            "But now we talk about clustering in an abstract way.",
            "To say, I would say that, but then it depends on what you're going to use this recommendation.",
            "OK, so later on.",
            "OK, right?",
            "I know so later on what I want to do is I want to try to define a bit more clearly what we want.",
            "If you want to select the number of clusters, I think the problem is.",
            "I mean we already had lots of workshop on clustering and trying to figure out what class rings and you will never agree on anything.",
            "I mean there are simply different problems here and you can have clustering being just like finding a compact representation of your data.",
            "You could also say it's finding modes in a density.",
            "So somehow like there are lots of different definitions and you will never.",
            "Ever agree on one definition?",
            "That's why on purpose didn't go into this business because otherwise we spent the workshop on a question I don't want to discuss important.",
            "But maybe we can discuss about this in the afternoons in more detail.",
            "Still well defined or no, I don't say anything so OK, so right now I just represent what people did in literature and in literature people also didn't define what they want to do.",

            "What I think is a good idea is not to output a complete clustering in the end again, but just make a statement about very few data points and justice.",

I say we we look at all those all those distances and OK. You can also use it for something else, namely to give more confidence is to something which is not a clustering of the whole space, but it's just a smaller clustering and it somehow corresponds to this idea where you have like you select the number of clusters on a different level on a different scale.",
            "Because of course you can run the algorithm a the basic one with different numbers of clusters and at some point if you use too many classes all this stuff will become very unstable so.",
            "What this just tells us, if you run the basic algorithm with 10 clusters with very high confidence, I find 5 five points which would be in the same cluster and it does not solve the issue of just saying it doesn't solve the question of how many classes we select, but maybe it's another way of using this stability tool to achieve something useful in the end.",
            "OK.",
            "Final result we get here is not a clustering, but then once we get it then here is a whole bunch of kind.",
            "Of course it's and these are going to be overlapping and not covering and like so it's not that we get some clustering of which we're confident about right and I think and I think the main point is that like if you want to select the number of clusters and maybe in your data set it happens that there are two classes which I really very clear.",
