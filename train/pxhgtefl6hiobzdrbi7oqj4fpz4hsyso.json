            "One is at we excesses Myologie, and there there is astrophysics, of which I tell you a little bit more in the in the talk.",
            "So what happens is that you see we have up to the 50s and the 60s.",
            "Statistical physics is basically thermodynamics and the theory of simple fluids.",
            "So the real breakthrough happens in the 70 with critical phenomenon and but this is at this moment that this is a field for connoisseurs.",
            "You know if you go in the library and look for the book is that this is a physics even in 75 or so you still find books on simple linguist and thermodynamics.",
            "And this is what happened when astrophysicist went to the library for the first time to analyze the distribution of galaxies.",
            "There isn't that this happened in about.",
            "In the 1960 or 1970, the reason is that before this time, astrophysics was observation of individual objects.",
            "So once that and so on or wanna Galaxy, then people got a lot of data and at this moment the concept of statistic comes into the field of large scale astrophysics.",
            "So what happen if they went to the library, took a book of Liquid's and they compute the Delta overall and things like this?",
            "So what happened in the field as developed?",
            "With this concept, which in some sense are still valid today.",
            "I mean, I still used today, but then the data began to show different properties, so if they it is or in the 90s we started looking at the data with the more modern view in which you can also have some say complex or fractal or whatever situation which cannot be really described in this perspective, in which you always assume that fluctuation says more with respect to some well defined average.",
            "So this is a situation in which the.",
            "Complex properties which I will show in a few minutes and in my opinion very important of course is a situation in which the collaboration is not easy because you've got the question one of the basic assumption of large scale astrophysics and cosmology which is homogeneity, which on the other hand is extremely well observed in the cosmic radiation.",
            "So the big dichotomy, large scale astrophysics of very smooth radiation and very irregular galaxies.",
            "This is today the biggest problem.",
            "And that most of it is all that we build is dark matter and dark energy, which I think is a little bit too much to say that 98% of matter and energy, something we don't see, and we probably never will see.",
            "So this is the situation of an interaction which I would say is more conflict choele.",
            "Namely, they would be very happy with the non complex distributions, and the discussion is not so easy.",
            "The situation of geophysics is completely different, even though if you look at data for the position of earthquakes, time and space position, they look very similar to galaxies.",
            "So at first sight if you just look at pictures you would say.",
            "But if there are complex structures in the Sky in the cosmos, there are also in the geophysics, and that's true.",
            "But then the situation of the field is totally different.",
            "First, geophysicist lab to talk to us.",
            "And they agree completely that things are complex because they know since 1940 the good timber, if their law, the good American law, tells you that the distribution of earthquakes over a very large space and they all earth and over a very long time.",
            "This distribution is a power law.",
            "The power law is a typical summer element of complexity, and it tells you something very important.",
            "It tells you that the small earthquakes and the same dynamics that the larger earthquakes so it gives you an information about log issue.",
            "The information that if you study very carefully the statistics of this earthquakes, maybe you can learn something about the large ones, but what is the problem here?",
            "The problem is that the amount the real challenge in earthquakes is to make some prediction prediction of large quakes.",
            "This is somehow really what people care a lot and this is where we cannot really do it.",
            "Because what would be our approach to that weight problem, which I mean there are many papers I also do.",
            "If you in this direction I would approach would be to say let's make a model like the sent file or some type of spring block model.",
            "There are many types in the from this model we show that we reproduce the good Timber Richter.",
            "If we are very good then mathematically inclined we can make it a normalization group more or less exactly something we can even compute the exponent.",
            "So in some sense.",
            "At this time we write the paper and we say we have solved the problem because we have reproduced good American.",
            "But for the this is myologie problem.",
            "This is nothing because from the point of view of predicting, this doesn't predict anything.",
            "He predicts that in an infinite time and in an infinite space there will be this distribution.",
            "But you want to know precisely the opposite.",
            "So the challenge in seismology is to reduce the properties of our beloved correlations and not to go to the exponent so to say.",
            "But to go to the short time and scale and this, of course, we're not the customers.",
            "All our tools here are tools to some out to compute, as in tatic very large times, very large space and so on.",
            "So it may be in the challenger for earthquakes.",
            "It would be to open up a new path, which we still don't have and address questions which are not universal but which can somehow give clues.",
            "On small timescale correlation here of course that there have been a lot of discussions.",
            "The most common idea for prediction of earthquakes.",
            "But by the way, earthquakes are a little bit simplified version of economics because both of complex interactions.",
            "But the earthquakes have the advantage that they don't adapt.",
            "So if you find the mathematical way to analyze that wakes and to predict them, they do not that you build it and they just continue to behave as before.",
            "So discovery of predictability prediction of earthquakes is in a way much easier than in economics where you have the adaptation problem.",
            "So in some sense is sort of the beginners for predicting economics.",
            "But still there is a big problem because the basic idea of prediction of earthquakes is very simple.",
            "You think they imagine you have a stick, a wooden stick, you bend it until it breaks.",
            "You expect it before it breaks it sneaks it, makes some noise.",
            "So this is the idea.",
            "The idea is that before some major event you have some precursor events.",
            "And here comes the problem for us, because for example, when I realized of this I was standing the nice model upper back of the sent file, which is also a metaphor opponent.",
            "Quickly, many respect if you study the same pain model, you can prove that the in the brain model there is absolutely no precursors.",
            "So this endpoint mother in this respect.",
            "Does not go in the direction of detecting precursors, but then you could say our general.",
            "Is this precursors precursors are not universal elements so you can have them or not and you can find different models which give rise to the same good American law some.",
            "We left precursors and some will not have resources.",
            "So you see you enter a new story which exposures are sort of marginal and other elements began the protagonist but the other elements are known universal so.",
            "It's a little bit like being in the mad then when you look at real earthquakes.",
            "This precursor story, if it is not entirely true, because if there would be the precursors, you would say who cares about the same time other.",
            "We just look at the progress of the real earthquakes and we use.",
            "We invent some statistical tool to analyze the precursors.",

            "There are earthquakes which are with regards to send that which are.",

            "The situation is pretty clear.",
