            "You should manage your content.",
            "How could you do that?",
            "You can do in two ways.",
            "One is a local way as a result of the play we are going to ship an open source.",
            "Toolkit in fact we have that, but we are tailoring up and so you can install that software into your into your installation and use that freely.",
            "Or you can try it online.",
            "For now, I guess the best way to know what is do what you are doing is to do it online, and for that we have put them aside.",
            "If you don't want to install the software and you want us to make that, we can talk about that for.",
            "An after that, trance transcription and translations.",
            "Are nearly perfect are much better, but usually you want review that because you have to be sure that your content is OK before before giving that.",
            "So we have an especially supplier that is also open license to review the content and to manage those changes.",
            "OK, so first of all you have to integrate well.",
            "For instance you need a button for displaying that this is integration.",
            "We have a polymedia just is just to take into account because it's more likely you have to change your player because of the several languages here you have a dragon box that you can select the language as you are using and then you can.",
            "Allow the authors to jump.",
            "Editor is in Spanish.",
            "Sorry to jump and change things that they find.",
            "That is that don't work.",
            "Even if you're brave enough, you can let your users change the transcriptions and correct for you.",
            "Make some crowd crowdsourcing of transgressors.",
            "OK, what we did at the end for us for our work is to use the local strategies so we are testing.",
            "We are eating our own food or the food.",
            "So we install a software we had unusable for that and we have found it quite easy because the way we have designer is that jewel new box that is the transcription server and then you have is.",
            "What is nearly independent of the other systems you are cutting out?",
            "How we do with that?",
            "We provide a set of web services for managing that.",
            "So for instance, there's an Indian server that is the server you have to call.",
            "Whenever I lecture gets uploaded for the transcriptor, there's a status to know if a lecture has been transcribed or not, and in which language.",

            "Is that having transcribed for lecture?",
            "Or to get the DSP there subtitles file.",
            "So it's quite easy for our point of view to deploy that box to ingest content and to manage your content.",
            "OK.",
            "So as I say to you, we have.",
            "I guess our website or sorry.",
            "It's not there.",
            "OK.",
            "This is our website.",
            "OK.",
            "This is always hard to say project, so then you can visit the player website and know everything about us.",
            "Maybe it's not what you want up to now.",
            "You can transcribe your videos or try or tools.",
            "OK if you want to transcribe your videos, you will.",
            "There you will hear.",
            "Sure.",
            "You have to log in.",
            "As for a log in with you gladly.",
            "And if everything goes right.",
            "OK, then you have to upload form so then you can upload your media up to I guess up to five out of five videos.",
            "Then you give the title the media file also this lifestyles because cellphone say before we are using this license additional content to provide better transcriptions and translations and an email for finding the content for receiving an email when everything is finished.",
            "When everything is finished up you will find the content and onto the platform for you to download the subtitles.",
            "Auto correct them.",
            "To do that you go to the second option.",
            "That this trailer tools.",
            "To this option just for be safe with the Wi-Fi.",
            "Here it is.",
            "So you arrive to a place.",
            "Then you have the software we use to manage the transcription and translation.",
            "This is what we call TL.",
            "Player is also open source.",
            "So here you will find the list of translation of of videos.",
            "Then you press one.",
            "You are here and then you can manage your translation.",
            "Show me.",
            "Yeah, she's talking.",
            "OK so I have no sound I guess.",
            "I have no sound here there.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Why do I don't have any sound?",
            "OK. No way you can play.",
            "You can hear an the this window runs up to down a passing the text as you are working as you're working on then if you find something that is wrong is quite easy to press on to the top.",
            "And change anything.",
            "Angle one OK, so it's quite easy because you are following the path.",
            "If you are working with translations then what would you have is?",
            "About down here.",
            "Short here.",
            "That you can select the source language and the target language.",
            "For instance, if I would want.",
            "The translation to Spanish.",
            "Then I have a parallel text of Windows, so is going up to down and you can manage your subscription.",
            "Whenever the transcription and translation has been review, you can save the changes and then you can use.",
            "There's a lot of scription button to download that, So what we're doing now is to find people that want to try our tools an say us if we're doing right or bad, we have the.",
            "The scientific evaluation that says we're doing right, but we want people to tell us.",
            "OK, so if you want you can enter the platform and ask for for our log in and upload some videos and try that.",
            "Finally.",
            "This is the TL player, as I say this open source.",
            "And this is this way.",
            "OK, finally let me say that we have made also an internal evaluation with teachers.",
            "So we have 52 lecturers supervising the results of the project.",
            "And we have some interesting results.",
            "OK, this is our results while in the Spanish we gave, we arrive from aware of 12 that is nearly perfect.",
            "Auntie Chan teachers wanted to be sure that all the transcription was perfect so they use an error on average time of 2.7 times the video time so they use about three times the video length to review the video and change everything.",
            "I'm giving everything correct in Catalan.",
            "We arrive from a 40 for the evaluation.",
            "No no, we are much better, but this wasn't evaluation phase and they use five times.",
            "And in English we are reference 36 and we get six times.",
            "Keep in mind that our teachers and teachers making the review were non native English speakers.",
            "OK, anyway, at the end of the correction, as often say before these scores is called.",
            "After correction, we arrive to aware of eight.",
            "So as I was saying, 12 is nearly perfect and we expect interact that or so from English.",
            "And for my final slide, this is lies show the error rate of the file.",
            "Consider and the time to review that.",
            "Us as anybody can can think on the better.",
            "The first transcription, the less time to correct them, so we are quite happy becausw as because if you are under 20.",
            "Most of the review time is about four times.",
            "If you have ever make a manual transcription, you know that for a manual transcription you need at least 10 times the length of the video.",
            "So by using the platform by using the the software in the worst case you are having the time unit for that, and chances are that you get a lot a lot lower, so I guess that's what I wanted to say.",
            "Sorry it's my last slide.",
            "Yeah we have work as a cell phone said we have work in English, Spanish, Catalan and login for the project.",
            "Now we are beginning a new project Column A that is directed to Moocs and then our part is to work on the transcription or translation of those contents.",
            "And we are committed in working with French, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Estonian.",
            "This is our 2 1/2 year project.",
            "We're just beginning, so we're expecting to add more languages to add.",
            "Let me say that for we have began with that.",
            "And we are very happy we are going quite fast because all the all the way we have we have.",
            "We have worked for Spanish.",
            "An English is been quite easy to add different languages.",
            "At least with that has been quite easy.",
            "I have my concerns with Estonian but we will work on.",
            "So that's all.",
            "If you have any question for me or for our phones.",
