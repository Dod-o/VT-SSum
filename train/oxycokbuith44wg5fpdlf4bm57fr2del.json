            "We have no gender issues or this.",
            "This is just a joke from the Commission or some like this, but on the other side, when I was evaluator actually this this section was read quite carefully, so but it was not really red in that sense that it was carefully that really the project has some deep plan how Naoto promotes all these gender and or some other imbalance.",
            "This kind of imbalance is is just that the fact that the proposal or the coordinator to care about this question.",

            "Contributions are really valuable and so on, but we can notice this imbalance is very, very fast, so financial imbalances.",

            "Uh, whether one partner wrote something and the other one the same, or something like this.",
            "Oh, then, something which is also very important.",

            "Common language or intuitive language, but I mean going too deep in some technical descriptions then usually it gets too messy.",

            "Loss really very easily on all possible even just because of gender issues.",
            "Let's say which might be funny for some people, but at the end really this kind of small things decides.",
