            "So the idea is that if a new node you want to create edges, it will create edges local in the network by sort of following or burning the existing edges of the network in a recursive way and then attaching to adding new nodes to this other nodes in the network.",

            "So the way the way this algorithm developed that we call itself operates is that it selects influential blogs in a sequential manner, and you can see how by by adding new and new blocks, how they're like, covering neighborhoods around around these blocks, and if I go run this.",
