            "So we need to form an execution semantics.",
            "And if you want to do execution semantics for this kind of process, you need to combine workflow notions with the eye actions and change literature, because executing an action of precondition affect discursive corresponds to higher taxes and change.",
            "So that's where I come into play, and then we combine it with workflow and as far as I'm aware we're doing the first formalism here, which does this kind of combination, which I personally find quite exciting.",

            "So we did that we defined.",
            "Execution semantics and what we want to do is we want to validate whether this process makes sense with these annotations, and this is an interesting problem 'cause the workflow in the annotations interact.",
            "So if you could just feed them in separate and there would be no need to combine them in any non trivial way, but they may interact.",

            "So for one thing the process and bigger, so depending on which order you execute the tasks, you get a different result which might be noticeable.",
            "Or if it should happen by chance that there actually executed at the same time, then, well, you're basically in a deadlock, so there are, these are just two aspects you've been looking at.",

            "Another thing is if you go the whole way down with the semantic business process management is done in super, so if you actually implement the process tasks with semantic web services.",
