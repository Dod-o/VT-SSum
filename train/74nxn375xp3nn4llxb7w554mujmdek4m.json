            "Well in principle all vertices should disappear, but we're fitting feeding system again and again.",
            "There are some experiments which which I didn't have time to describe, which are very interesting where people are exciting the system.",

            "The fact that you see the same path is determined by the boundary conditions.",
            "Presumably the the fact that we see the same path is is dictated by the disorder in the sample.",
            "OK, we we see that in by solving the equation hundreds of times and the phase initial fees is not the same and you find that as the initial phase is not the same you have differences but eventually their preferred path and the preferred path are the ones which are dictated by the disorder.",
            "Right, so so there's only one solution basically favored every time they well.",
            "Yes, and we know it's more complicated than that.",
            "It's might be that's the difficulty of our experiment is that we are unlike the Bose Einstein condensation of rubidium.",
            "We are not looking at one single realization.",

            "So we only observe something if.",
