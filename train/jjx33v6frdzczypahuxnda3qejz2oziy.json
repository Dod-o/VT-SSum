            "Now that you've got something in place, you can actually go back and look at the parts and see if they actually hang together.",
            "So one of the things that struck me always look at peoples titles because the title can tell us so much about what it is that you do.",
            "So I read open educational practices something.",
            "OK, So what is meant by that?",
            "So this is the same thing as afraid to say what is open and what is educational open education.",
            "And then what are the practices?",
            "Because later on in your research questions and what you intend to do, you foreground open education.",
            "Resource is and you a full ground Open Access, but if I was to read the title owning and make a judgment about whether or not this thesis would be of interest to be as an early are practitioner, somebody and Open Access, and particularly somebody who's trying to look at both, I wouldn't give that seats from what we saying.",
            "So that's just a heads up that if you are going to be doing something is actually going to be combining both.",
            "Those you perhaps need an indicator earlier on, not just in the title, but as a using the title as kind of seating your key concepts.",
            "So and then the other thing is to be just aware that the concept open education resource open educational practices has a history, so it's not just coming as a term you can just kind of use as you please, or one that you could.",
            "You can perhaps conflate so open educational practices actually is coming out of the O ER movement and people might misunderstand that you actually meaning or we are practices.",
            "To sit above open education practices and Open Access, you have to argue for that to make it so you drink a little bit of a conceptual Diggle.",
            "I need to make sure that people who reading what you presenting actually can recognize the rest of the literature in what you do so.",
            "I think in a way you understand him.",
            "What you are about to do, because in a way you are only talking about a practice where in fact you are looking at just.",
            "You're looking at different practices, teaching practice and a research practice.",
            "Um, that is far more difficult, and I think you could be for grounding.",
            "Bent.",
            "So I guess that's the one thing.",
            "And the other thing is about the practices.",
            "When I saw an education practices.",
            "I was really excited because one of the things we do a lot of talking and people have a lot of opinions about practices.",
            "But when you actually go and see what they do in reality, there's a real disjuncture between what they say they do and the opinion they have and what you actually do.",
            "Now, if I understand your methodology correctly, you've got a policy analysis that's going to lead you into questionnaires, which is going to need you to focus group.",
            "The questionnaire is not necessarily going to tell you about the exact practice is going to tell you about what people really would like you to think about what they're doing now that they are doing, and then if you selecting from that, the people in the focus group, you need to be careful that you not assuming practices from self reporting only.",
            "So I'm just I'm just giving a heads up that you know we need talking to both practices.",
            "It's something that really is worth looking at.",
            "But a questionnaire alone and a focus group alone isn't actually going to get you to the concept of practices, so ultimately looking at.",
            "And kind of construct validity.",
            "Are you investigating?",
            "What you say you investigating?",
            "That's the bottom line.",

            "Who started some work on the back order coherence of open initiatives in higher education and research, framing their policy agenda?",
            "I'll give this to you afterwards.",
            "This is actually published this year and they are complaining that we're looking at these things separately.",
            "We've got separate oyar.",
            "Even separate Open Access.",
            "We've got separate repository's for teaching materials in separate Repository's with Journal articles, so you don't have to sleep.",
            "You still can see somebody is doing some work for you.",
            "No, but it's actually good.",
            "It means I'm getting somewhere with this.",
            "It's not.",
            "It's not necessarily bad.",
            "Um?",
            "Yes, I I would agree about the question that there's a conceptual risk I'm taking and I'm.",
            "I'm not sure whether I'm fully aware of it.",
            "I'm a bit aware of this conceptual risk of trying to.",
            "Consider these two aspects in the open educational practices.",
            "The fact I believe that it's not as well defined as yo yaaran as the Open Access is a help I think.",
            "If we could assume the practices themselves as what people do.",
            "A practice is what I do.",
            "And what do I do in these two perspectives for this?",

            "Let me never that.",

            "That's a good question.",
            "Well, I was actually thinking of the accredited degrees that there exists in practice.",
            "Because, well, that's how it makes sense to me.",
            "If it's if it's.",
            "Something that already exists and has a tradition on that.",
            "I think we can develop and we can study and find some evolution or not in one sense or the other in terms of the accredited existing degrees offered by these institutions, yes.",
            "OK, I don't know if I may.",
            "I would like to follow up on the trails in Mark and I think in the way you have you have a very broad folders and so open ducation practices as I was trying to explain means practice of open education applications are very broad concept.",

            "Practices and I was triggered by the Charles remark about your title.",
            "It might help to get more, focusing your research to to concentrate on urban exercise.",
            "That's the thing I like very much because to connect Open Access with ovr as it is very useful but not to get into in a very broad discussion about open education is that might be complicating your research, and if you if you focus on early are on the one hand.",
            "And of course it's about practice practicing alright.",
            "It's not the same as RVP.",

            "Please focus more than you have done so far because always it's too broad and in my view, as I said, it's a very impressive activity that you've done so far.",
            "I think come quite far, but there's a certain risk of getting too broad, and as my view more or less, maybe it's better to focus on the practice of Open Access and how we are with faculty, staff, members.",
            "Ready psychology also comes in that product was referring to and I noted in work for D. There's a couple of projects also studying, let's say the attitude of teachers that is extremely important, but then you get away from the very broad discretion.",
            "Moreover, education is because that's that's a difficult discussion in my opinion.",
            "So that's a kind of a final suggestion.",
