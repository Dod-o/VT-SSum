            "So we've got this huge public providers which are difficult to move.",

            "So we have a potential for further market growth.",
            "And then the response of the market is much faster, so if you're trying to bring a new technology and you have if you have a big gap, it will just be impossible to bring it actually to show the added value to the health care providers.",
