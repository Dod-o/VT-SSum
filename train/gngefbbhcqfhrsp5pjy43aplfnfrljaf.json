            "But it needn't be, and the way that this assumption gets messed up is if you have people in your study that are related to each other because you have families or whether you know they're in there or not.",

            "And sometimes people think, well, the more data you have, the you know, the more you reduce the signal you increase the signal to noise ratio and the better off you are.",
            "But for this kind of problem, what happens as you increase the number of people and data in the data set, you actually increase your power to detect these differences and the problem doesn't go away, so you can't just say I'm going to make my data set large."
