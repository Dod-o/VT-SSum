            "And then obviously one part that is obviously always needs to be extended.",
            "Regards the tooling, and in this case supporting automated bundling of services and the comparison of services across across service providers are the main the main aspects that we're going to be working on, so that was it from my side.",
            "Thank you for your attention.",
            "What I wanted was I'm since if I understood it properly, you've taken this core of usdol, aligned it with good relations and made extensions, and in the meantime good relations is taken into schema.org.",
            "Is it the case that one can easily markup on the public web service offerings with schema.org?",
            "Have Google Index said and then use their hits to find these richer usdol descriptions, is that?",
            "Not not just is that feasable, but is that something that's actually practicable today?",

            "Essentially one is that it was, you know, it's a living, it's a living creature.",
            "That essentially is somehow semi controlled by other institutions.",
            "Now we also knew at the time that good relations was already in the process of being aligned.",
            "So actually our approach to this was a line into good relations which in turn is aligned with schema.org that would allow on the one hand to be to be have a step into schema.org through this alignment and on the other hand it would also give us a better view on how we could go for standingschema.org.",

            "Or is this is the kind of machine to human communication.",
            "Right, and I remembered the the second question now.",
            "If we talk about Human Services like in human computation or anywhere else, you have nondeterministic behavior.",
            "So you have almost no guarantees or very specific types of guarantees about the performance of these services.",

            "Certain understanding of the quality of service which I don't know if it's what you have in mind when you're talking about crowdsourcing, but these are the kinds of level we want to go into without going to domain specific, because obviously what we want this is to remain generally applicable and what we've seen is that for all those domains you end up developing vertical extensions for the sect."
