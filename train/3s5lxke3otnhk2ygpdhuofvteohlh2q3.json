            "So as I mentioned this morning, the first thing that we need in very few dynamics is geometry.",
            "For this reason, I opened a file that is available for all of you in the school, and you can download when the school coordinator.",
            "It's called the Enter will give you the access to this material as a code or super mentary material into the web page of the school.",
            "The file is named measure.",
            "30 Dot video an it's quite common file format are based on the visualization toolkit with K that has been obtained from medical images and a this is a public set of lies that we got from the lyrics.",
            "Installation An we process the image with VM TK library which is very very probably one of the most standardized toolkit to extract geometry's from set of biomedical images.",
            "And the empty K is also implement.",
            "It's all based on script and so have a very simple graphical user interface, but is also implemented as add-on package.",

            "And this is a very common.",
            "Well study at the district Becausw.",
            "The shape of the carotid artery it's changing during aging process, and this changes that are very very slow, but they occurs over years and also the formation of let's say the position of fat material that not allow for correct fluid.",

            "For this reason it's very, very studied in hemodynamics.",

            "To get a CFD model of this kind of vascular district that is very irregular as you see, an very 3D.",

            "This is the external carotid artery, so the branching.",
            "To get to get an idea, this is a very true dimensional OK, so it's a real case, but we cannot use this kind of geometry to perform CFD analysis for cause, mainly because to the fact that if we apply boundary conditions, so if we apply pressure condition or velocity or mass flow rate condition on this kind of district, probably we will get instabilities.",
            "Or uncorrected unrealistic values.",
            "Do it to the fact that we are too near to the boundary and we are imposing let's say some bias at the information and then we are computing something that is not related to reality.",

            "So these two entities that are fluent with the graphical user interface and clues fluent without the graphical user interface are identical, with the only difference is that on one case.",
            "You will have the graphical user interface and the menu are some of the.",
            "Some of the available menu are also shown as.",
            "Dag here OK.",

            "OK?",
            "This is because of the fact that fluent as.",

            "So any batches occlusion of fluent and much more in parallel.",
            "This is much more true.",
            "So when you want to achieve number crunching, an several simulation at the same time.",
            "Anyway, you cannot manage all with the graphical user interface because it doesn't make any sense.",
            "You will work on.",
            "You will work on.",
            "On on the minus G flag, set it on OK. To go, I prepared one simple example of what I'm talking about, so tutorias.",

            "Minus G minus is so as an input we give our our journaling and OK Now fluent will execute our command that are very simple.",
            "In this case I asked the application to read case, set up to read the data as a flowing Salvation and to perform 10 iteration and then to exit without.",

            "The first thing that I usually do when I when I when I read the one mesh is to check the mesh and this command is under mesh check which is the first OK and this gives me the information about the scale of my mesh.",
            "OK so a measure I hope that everybody has an idea it's let's say a description.",
            "Of discretized version of our geometry in terms of points.",
            "Line an notes that represent a single mesh element.",
            "In this case a triangle OK. Um, this geometry is a carotid artery, so I understand that the description that I gave so that once when the when we built the MSH file, we didn't provide any information about the real scale of our problem, but the scale of it is meaningful if you want to use meaningful quantities so we can understand from this value that we don't have a carotid artery which is.",
            "Located almost here that long in that large, OK so we need to scale our mesh.",
            "And we can do this.",
            "This is a first step on each, so we can specify a scaling factor OK?",
            "So 0.001 so this was built in millimeters OK. OK, and then we type scale.",
            "OK, now if we go again under check we see that.",
            "That now the extension of our problem as change according to our scale factor and that now we are pretty much confident that dimension of our problem is correct.",
            "This is an important step when you are working with fluent because all the quantities in fluent are with.",
            "Dimension K so it would be a big difference if you have meters instead of millimeter and by servers, OK.",

            "So usually you perform a sensitivity analysis watching some parameter, not all.",

            "Which is the external carotid artery?",
            "OK, so.",

            "We can then found the value OK that have been set for each boundary condition.",
            "OK.",

            "OK, in the same way.",
            "I I skip it.",
            "Also this in theory, but as a first as a first set up for this case you can leave the simple pressure velocity coupling OK, which is also fast.",
            "An at least square OK cell base it and we can also go downgrade to 1st order upwind, because now we're not looking for.",
            "Let's say any detailed solution but just first tentative one to perform a sensitivity analysis on the grid size.",

            "For this problem.",
            "What is more important in my view is too.",
            "Edit The residual control.",
            "I skipped this part of theory, but I I will recall something quickly now.",
            "I'm looking for convergence with this iterative methods.",
            "The concept of convergence it's very tricky to define, but there is some indicators that helps you to identify if the solution is not changing after a certain point.",
            "OK, if the value inside of the flow field are not changing from one iteration to the next, or if they are changing their changing up to a certain.",
            "Accept and value OK, we can state that there is evil.",
            "We decide that 10 to minus five.",
            "It's OK for us as a convergence criteria, OK?",
            "Um and that.",
            "We want to block the OK. We want to see the evolution of the.",
            "Yeah of the residual and then we want to also read it on the console so we can consider.",
