            "We have a few quick we have time for a few questions so please.",
            "Don't be shy, there's a question there.",
            "What is theoretically possible to use groups of quantum entangled particles?",
            "Which properties we could control?",
            "To teleport objects.",
            "Well.",
            "I'm not sure objects, I guess.",
            "It's the teleportation is really the teleportation of information, I think.",
            "So the information is contained in the quantum state and there's a theorem that says you can't copy a quantum state.",
            "You can't make a copy of a quantum state because in some sense too.",
            "If you want to want to make make a quantum state exactly equal to another quantum state.",
            "Of course, you could always measure it and then find out what it was and then make a copy of it.",
            "The idea is to copy it without measuring it, so you have a quantum state you don't know what it is you want to make, another one, which is exactly the same it tells us.",
            "Basic theorem that says you can't do that.",
            "You can't copy a state without measuring it, and then of course.",
            "But the teleportation ideas you can take a state that you don't know what it is and you which is probably a set of atoms or spins at this point are in that state.",
            "The information is encoded in that state, but if you're trying to measure it, you reveal it and you can't process it anymore.",
            "So the quantum the teleportation issue is to take those state of those atoms and move it to another set of atoms far away.",
            "Of course, this information will no longer be here 'cause you couldn't copy it, so you've removed the information for those and put it over there and transmitted it.",
            "And that's what all this talk about quantum teleportation protocols are is for your teleporting, not the matter, but the state.",
            "Now, of course, you could argue that that I'm just a state of matter in a certain thing, and if it was, you know, Star Trek.",
            "Much finer.",
            "You tell that when you step into the box on this side, you are being destroyed here and and they and the other person who owned the box said, don't worry, you're going to be reconstituted over there, but of course this is a question of trust, right?",
            "But but if, of course, if you say we're just a state, then.",
            "The matter itself is not getting transported.",
            "What's getting transported is the state of the matter is basically making, as I say, the making to remove the information here, destroy the stage, right?",
            "This is like but you move the state without actually knowing what it was without measuring it.",
            "And then you can, because in all this quantum protocols for quantum computation you manipulate the state and you do very things with it.",
            "You've got to get the answer out at the end of the day the answer is got by doing a measurement, right?",
            "But of course you can only do that after all the manipulations have been done, so you have to move the state around, and in this example, let's see if I got it again.",
            "I probably not.",
            "I'm not sure how to get out of this without I shouldn't have stopped it.",
            "I've I can't control this on my computer anymore because it's all I've got the wrong screen, but the if these things were the four blobs you can move them around the computations actually supposedly done by by called braiding.",
            "You got these these?",
            "Four things and I move one around the other in a certain path and it changes the quantum state.",
            "These little wiggly information patterns get changed by dragging one through the other and the computation protocols involve stiring this thing up and provided they never get close to each other.",
            "You're protected, the information is protected now.",
            "There's still at the end of the day, there's still an issue of getting it out, right?",
            "So you actually have to bring something close together, so there's still a dangerous period when you try to extract the information.",
            "And of course, but so as a theoretical possibility conceptually, this is, this protection is very appealing as avoiding this whole issue of entangled with environment because the information is not.",
            "It's stored locally.",
            "It's a bit like your memories in the header kind of thing.",
            "We know a bit more where they're stored, but you can get, you know you can get shot in the head and and parts of you missing, but you can reconstruct.",
            "It doesn't have.",
            "It's not clear where the memory.",
            "You can't just ZAP a particular neuron and say the memory is gone, 'cause it's stored is stored in this kind of non locally right and simply information can be stored in this nonlocal paddle of entanglement.",
            "And conceptually that's a way to avoid this whole issue of contamination by the environment now.",
            "There's lots of 1st Quantum computer, maybe a small one and maybe they build it with ion traps and things.",
            "But also there's lots of different Google or backing.",
            "One thing Microsoft put a billion dollars into braiding.",
            "China wants to put 10 billion dollars because they want to have the world for me.",
            "Lots of.",
            "I mean, there's lots of lots of different approaches, which is good 'cause they're all competing with.",
            "Competition is really pushing people and.",
            "And the claim is that if you get you just the claim is you.",
            "If you could make a 50 qubit computer, you could beat today's Q, but if I don't have true or not, but that you know, starting off, we're trying to make a three qubit computer, but to push it to 50 we've got this big problem making things bigger.",
            "And this is 1 one approach, but it may not be the one that wins, or maybe none of them win, right?",
            "OK, some more questions please.",
            "Somehow, this revival of entanglement is that.",
            "True that in fact, normal ground state of the matter are not entangled.",
            "That's why it's only rediscovered now.",
            "Or yeah, normally the this is the kind of kind of long range topological entanglement Sensi, as I say in this spin chain, you chop it.",
            "The entanglement if it's going all the way through it.",
            "If you break it, it's gotta stop.",
            "So in some sense, that's why the boundaries.",
            "So the normally of course there's always entanglement.",
            "A short short amount, but there's no kind of profound entanglement like there is in these materials, so.",
            "If you have two pieces of matter, of course, if you make a measurement of 1 pic close to another bit, they affect each other, but the measurement doesn't affect things at long distance, so so the normal things that the toy model of just a completely independent atoms assembled into a into a line.",
            "Of course they do interact a little bit, but they don't have this kind of dramatic.",
            "Difference topological difference.",
            "So everything is a little bit entangled across any boundary.",
