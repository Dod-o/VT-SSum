            "You might have been wondering what was that?",
            "That's actually a fully nonparametric estimate of what your Click to distribution from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM is.",
            "So it starts out with an initial estimate and all that you really saw while I was using it was that initial estimate because I didn't use it for very long at all.",
            "But it's updated with a modified person window estimator based on your user clicks as you use it.",
            "So you can start off immediately, but overtime it will adapt to you.",
            "So if you're very precise as I am after I use it for awhile, it's going to let me choose things and Nauman with just one or two clicks.",
            "An on the other hand, if you're very imprecise, it gives you the time to make a selection that you need so that you're not always undoing.",
            "Now this actually works on a delay, so that if you were to undo something, you're implicitly saying, oh, I don't want those clicks to actually count for something so we don't use those clicks in our actual estimate of your distribution, and it's damped because you're probably going.",
            "It's possible that you're going to change your use of Nauman overtime, you know if you just started it, maybe you're not that accurate with how you click, but later on you might become more accurate and we wanted to be able to adapt to that, not just be set in stone from the beginning.",

            "It's when you're the posterior probability of the highest probability Clock reaches a threshold, and you can set that threshold.",
            "So if you're just typing and you want to be very fast, you can set it sort of low.",
            "You know you don't really mind on doing, and if you have a very secure action like you want to delete a file or shut down your computer and just get rid of everything you've been working on, you want that to be very secure and in some sense you know your computer is approximating this when you're on a Unix station and it says.",

            "People who haven't been using in designing it like I have, so we actually recruited 16 able participants from the University of Cambridge who had no previous experience with any single switch interface, and in particular not with scanning, which was the grid like interface that I described at the beginning or with Nauman because it's very new.",
            "And they were paying \u00a310 for each of one hour for each of two one hour sessions.",

            "Now that session was divided into 14414 minutes sections and in the last section we said we're going to time you were going to say what is your reading speed and if you are writing speed is in the top half of writing speeds for that particular interface will give you a 5 pound bonus, so you don't have to be super fast, but you kind of want to be on your ball and pay attention.",
            "And the result was that actually novices wrote 35% faster with nominal and with no difference in their error rate when they did that.",
            "Also, in this graph we have clicks per character on the side."

            "And so we want to minimize that.",
            "So it's nice to see that nominee actually doesn't take a lot more clicks than the opposing interface, and in fact what we have here is also experienced user data.",
            "So that's me.",
            "After using each of these both, both the grid and Nauman for over 10 hours, and I think that all you can really get from that is actually.",
            "It's possible to get to do quite a bit better with Nauman and quite a bit better with clicks per character.",
            "An writing speed after some time after using these interfaces.",
            "And another interesting thing, an important thing when we're thinking about not only the disabled community, but anybody who's using this is isn't enjoyable.",
            "Is it something that you could see yourself using for any sort of long term use?",
            "And so we also administered questionnaires to the participants after using both nominant scanning.",
