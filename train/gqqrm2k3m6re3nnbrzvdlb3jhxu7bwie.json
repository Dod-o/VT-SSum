            "On each one of the nodes.",
            "So this is the possible extension of the algorithm.",
            "Another extension is multiple hops, so one may consider the case in which you are not.",

            "Only from your nearest neighbors, but you go for a second or third or further away.",
            "Then another more practical aspect of the problem is dynamical allocation of settings, because in peer to peer networks and in most popular networks nodes are coming in, moving out the topology is changing all the time and therefore we need some sort of relatively fast approach to allocate segments reality segments.",
