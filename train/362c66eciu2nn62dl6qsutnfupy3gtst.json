            "Help this would be in line with the introductory talks we've been hearing today where it was told that we went just about advocating about understanding why it would be a good idea, but much more about how so or idea here was to select a number of themes in which we have to think in terms of how.",
            "How can we do to enhance the use of away, or how can we do to get the right technologies in the right times or in the right places.",

            "But then, little by little, we understood that we were talking to a much larger.",

            "Business community is the right word, but the research community in saying that there are really exciting problems here and we would like people to workup on these problems.",
            "Some of these problems come from the social Sciences.",
            "Of course there's a lot of things to be said about why and how Oro we are.",
            "Working is not just about believing, it's about understanding, but there's also the technology Sciences.",
            "Which should be built playing a role and the second community is the business community because even if we, as scientists are capable of creating tools, usually our tools have got problems to actually reach everybody.",
            "Those who do know how to reach out with the tools or going to be with the people from industry.",
            "So we're going to find the right way to work with them so that they can perhaps work with people from technology to develop some ice tools, some tools, and then find the way to actually access everybody within.",
            "Of course the rules.",
            "The fare rules that are, let's say, organizm's agency like you know UNESCO promote.",
            "OK, so the goal of the workshop is just to keep moving forward upon these ideas, understand what are the blocking factors, and perhaps find some solutions that we can push to two other people.",
            "Technically, should I add something?",
            "I'm turning to devil?",
            "Have I said everything I had to say?",
            "No, there's one more thing.",
            "People who are speakers to the next sessions can put their slides either directly on this computer I've understood, or there is a Bureau upstairs where they can pass the slides.",
            "They're going to use.",
            "So as we don't have to shuffle with the slides during the presentations.",
            "OK, so you can give your slides in advance.",
            "Right, so in that case we have got a first session for which I don't have any slides, so the first session is is all about the building of the ovr, so the part where we're just trying to create the oers and we've got 3 speakers or three teams of speakers.",
            "Well, 2, two or two speakers and one team of speakers, and I would call the first speaker, which is Rory Mcrill, UNESCO ear chair from the University of Athabasca to come and give his little talk.",
