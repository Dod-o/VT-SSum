            "The major portion of his intellectual energies after about 1942, were devoted to philosophy, yet his publications were few.",

            "Quote I have completed several different versions, but none of them satisfies me.",
            "It is easy to allege very weighty and striking arguments in favor of my views, but a complete elucidation of the situation turned out to be more difficult than I had anticipated.",

            "He tends to do so and suggestive assertions rather than developed expositions.",
            "Detail both about the content of his views and about his reasons for holding them is lacking, so amplification would be needed if there is to be a real account of a general philosophical position.",
            "Now there's another level of knock loss that might help, but it's not publicly available.",
            "Girdle kept notebooks written in the Gobbles Burger shorthand that was widely used in Austria when he was young.",

            "Even there's two papers in volume three whose manuscripts were in Gobbles Burger and it consumed several years of effort to make those intelligible.",

            "Now another important source about girls general philosophical outlook lies in the work of the late, how long?",
            "His 1974 volume from mathematics to philosophy contains several pages of girl's views.",
            "Sometimes written to Vera Wang and sometimes oral remarks from conversations that girl in long held in 1970, one 72 and the accounts in that 1974 volume were apparently all vetted by Girdle.",
            "After girl's death, Wang published several more volumes that included reportage of his conversations with Girdle most at length in the volume, reflections on Girl from 1990.",
            "Wang reports right quote Long Girl considered what he told me in his discussions with me to be applications of his philosophy.",
            "He said that he had only developed his philosophy to the extent of being able to apply it, but that he had not reached the stage of giving it a direct statement.",
            "This girl thought that his positions on conceptual realism in mathematics on the foundations of set theory and the iterative conception of set and perhaps on the nature of mine in some sense, arise out of a more basic and general philosophical view.",
            "Even if he could not make that view fully explicit.",
            "In fact, long repeatedly characterizes Girdle's feeling that he did not reach success in philosophy.",

            "The important philosophical concepts are either analyzable into more basic ones, or are themselves primitive, and all the important content of the primitive concepts can be exhibited in precise axiomatic relations to other concepts.",
            "But what concept am I talking about in the remarks philosophy of mathematics?",
            "General girdle lists has a list of central philosophical content is concepts.",

            "Idea reality possibility.",

            "There's no hint in girls writing that the truth of metaphysics are problematic in any special way.",

            "The idea of a critique that would express the limitations of our ability to reason about these sorts of metaphysical concepts.",
            "Well, despite girls not being able to lay out his philosophy in this definitive manner, we can depict something of his basic metaphysics.",
            "I shall try to chart some links between this metaphysics and what girl called applications that is his using the philosophy of mathematics that are more familiar to us.",
            "Well girl felt.",
            "That his philosophical outlook went against the spirit of our times.",
            "Long reports that he said I don't consider my work a facet of the intellectual atmosphere of the early 20th century, but rather the opposite.",
            "And girls 1961 undelivered lecture helps us understand this remark.",
            "In it, girl proposes that philosophical worldviews be charted, quote according to the degree and the manner of their affinity.",
            "Two or renunciation of metaphysics or religion.",
            "Now here he means metaphysics, not in the professional philosophers sense, in which we do, for example, speak of a materialistic metaphysics, but rather in the more popular sense of a realm of reality that is literally supernatural.",
            "So he group skepticism, materialism and positivism on one side in this schematism and idealism, spiritualism and theology.",
            "On the other, he calls these the left and right sides.",

            "He does allow various exceptions.",

            "I mean, after all, what about Hegel?",
            "But I suspect that what he has in mind primarily is the logical positivism of the early 20th century, which of course he was surrounded by in Vienna.",
            "As well as its precursors.",
            "In any case, it seems clear that for girl, the spirit of the Times is 1, which is inhospitable to metaphysics that goes beyond the physical, ordinary world.",

            "Of course, we're quite correct about analytic philosophy as it's developed in the last 50 years, even after shedding positivism, since materialism or physicalism is certainly the dominant view.",
