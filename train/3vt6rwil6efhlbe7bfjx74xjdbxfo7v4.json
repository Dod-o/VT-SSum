            "So you can complain about the climate being too cold, but never too hot, so that was nice.",

            "So the motivation for all that.",
            "All of you who work in the area of wireless networks and wireless communications are used to seeing this motivation in some form or another, and it's primarily the fact that the demand for wireless data and mobile data rates is expected to increase very dramatically over the next few years, so all projections are for continued increase in mobile demand or demand for data rates.",
            "That's exponential.",
            "In the next few years to a decade so there.",
            "You can see many graphs like this one.",
            "This one comes from the FCC from a few years ago, but the actual numbers I don't think matter that much, but what matters is that there is this tendency to increase the capacity or the demand for capacity exponentially.",
            "But that's not the only problem.",
            "Big problem from the point of view of the operators is that even though the demand is increasing exponentially, what we are willing to pay for the services is not.",
            "So we already pay.",
            "More or less what we are willing to to pay in the near future.",
            "Maybe there's a possibility that I'll pay twice as much as I do now if my service increases very significantly, but I certainly am not going to pay 1000 times as much as I pay now for wireless services wouldn't be able to afford it even if I wanted to.",
            "So the mobile operators are faced with this need to increase their capacity by a factor of about 1000 is what most people are talking about an not increase their revenues by my very much at all.",
            "So how do you deal with this an there are some.",
            "Ways in which I think there is consensus that we need to deal with this one is to make more efficient use of available spectrum.",
            "So in practice electromagnetic spectrum is.",
            "Limited quantity, right?",
            "'cause you're not going to operate beyond a certain frequency, so.",
            "And most of this is allocated in almost every country allocated to various services, and the question is, can we do something a little bit better by being more flexible in the way that we use spectrum rather than these very static, not dynamic allocations of spectrum to particular services and through that achieve quite a bit of increase in data rate and then the other area in which I think there is.",
            "Pretty much consensus that these networks will have to move is towards small cells, so that's the way that historically mobile networks have evolved to allow more and more data in higher and higher data rates is by decreasing the size of the cells.",
            "So as you decrease the size of the cells you increase the potential for frequency reuse and therefore the aggregate capacity of the network increases.",
            "So it's pretty clear that that's one of the things that will need to happen that you will need to rely more and more on a heterogeneous environment where you may still have some macro cells, but you also have some picocells.",
            "Maybe some femtocells an maybe integration between.",
            "Technologies like LTE and LTE advanced and then Wi-Fi and other local area network technologies that operate in unlicensed spectrum.",
            "So these things there's some variation in how you do this, but I think the research community is pretty much looking at these or solutions that revolve around these aspects to try to meet this increase in demand.",
            "OK, so we also believe that those two things will be a strong component, but what we are currently investigating is some changes in the way that network is architected.",
            "Itself, so that in addition to making more efficient utilization of spectrum, in addition to shrinking the cells, we actually rely on networks that look very different from the ones that we have right now."

            "In the thing that in particular we are looking at is increasing the amount of sharing that goes on in wireless networks, and there are different ways of thinking about that and I'll discuss a few different ways to see if which one makes most sense or makes the concept clearer.",
            "So this would be one possibility of viewing the current landscape in terms of mobile network operators.",
            "Operators of Wi-Fi networks that May.",
            "May cell service for for price for money.",

            "Which is a way in which you can predict the outcome of these negotiations between players engaged in a cooperative game and then, more recently, we looked into a particular area of cooperative game theory which is called coalitional game theory, which allows us to model how sets of radios or sets of networks can enter into coalitions so they don't need to cooperate with every other network.",
