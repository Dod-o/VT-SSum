            "We mean by that I wanted to start off with an example, and broadly, there's obviously many, many good reasons why a company or someone else might be interested in checking, evaluating, managing their supply chain and what happens in a supply chain.",
            "But I just picked out one example, so recently there was in investigative report by Amnesty International who were looking into the doings and happenings of the palm oil industry.",
            "And it turns out that a lot of big corporates that claimed to be using sustainable palm oil actually weren't really doing that because they were implicated and we're getting supplied by a company called Wilma who it turns out was actually using child labor as well as forced labor so.",
            "Obviously it's probably fair to assume that some of these companies may have been aware of who Wilma is, maybe even that there was something fishy going on, but at the same time, oftentimes what can happen is that these connections between companies are in direct supply relations, so with supply relations we talk about when we talk about tiers.",
            "So a first tier supplier is a supplier that directly provides a company with goods, a second tier supplier is a supplier of a supplier, so on and so forth.",
            "So it might have been the case for some of these companies that they were linked to Wilmer, but not directly that they had a supplier who was in turn getting the palm oil from Wilma.",
            "And of course nevertheless they ended up in this report and we're getting incredibly bad press.",
            "So with these types of situations and many other situations we were looking at what's happening with supply chains, how they analyzed and we were wondering whether we could do something to help essentially.",

            "OK, we have these suppliers but they might not know what's happening beyond that.",

            "So there's only one type of predicate.",
            "And in the resulting graph, then obviously nodes represent companies and these companies are linked through directed relations pointing from a supplier to a customer.",
            "So with this graph, what we then wanted to do to sort of help gaining insight about these situations where maybe you know who your suppliers are, but what's happening beyond that is very unclear.",
            "We wanted to utilize this graph representation to identify certain risks that companies who might be your suppliers are exposed to.",
            "And Secondly, we also wanted to try and come up with a way of assigning a certain importance to these suppliers, and so I'll basically spend the rest of the talk just briefly walking you through how we measure these two aspects of what a supplier might look like and how we could evaluate a supplier, whether that's direct or indirect suppliers.",

            "That are assigned a set of attributes for companies that might be, for example, where the company is based on the legal entity type or the industry that a company operates in this then and I'll show how that fits in later is basically turned into a slider and I'll explain later why it is a slider, but."

            "So the first one criticality we use the datasets called the world Input Output database, which basically is a summary of.",

            "On average supplies, a lot of goods to the industry the customer operates in.",
            "Then we assign a higher criticality, the second one, replaceability is again around which industries the suppliers operate in.",
            "And here we make sort of a simplifying assumption by saying that.",
            "Companies in similar industries provides similar goods.",
            "So in the second example up there, so if we were to say that CO2 three and four marketing green operate in the same industry and supply to company five, we would consider them to be more replaceable than, for example company one because Co one is the only supplier from that industry to Company 5.",
            "The 3rd and 4th measure then are simple graph based measures where centrality.",

            "And the idea behind that was that we wanted to show yes, a company might be important to your supplier, might be important to you, but that might be moderated by other factors such as risk in this case.",
