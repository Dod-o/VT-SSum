            "OK.",

            "So sensor data predictions which are weather predictions and static properties this data gets into this data instance here and get stored into the measurements tables.",
            "On top of these measurements we calculate aggregates.",
            "I think it's like 50 aggregates in our system and these are aggregates for one hour, one day, six days.",
            "It depends on the.",
            "Each use case and these are moving averages, variances, minimums, maximums, and stuff like this.",
            "OK, but the real modeling cycle starts starts here at the modeling instance.",
            "So in the beginning we have the component that is called the load manager and this components wakes up every now and then, and so somehow maybe it would be time to make predictions and asks the data instance.",
            "Hey, tell me about all the data that you have and sent me this data in the aligned on the.",
            "On the timeline OK and then this data instance received this request and checks all the appropriate sensors and sees 1/2 for this timestamp.",
            "I'm completely sure that I have all the data.",
            "It orders them by on the timeline and it sends them to this engine.",
            "This component, which is the receiver, is just responsible to get the request and basically copied this structure to this structure.",
            "But The thing is that we are getting now the data aligned by time.",
            "OK, now we have here separate sensors.",
            "Still nothing is connected together, so the next component is the merger component and in this component and we for each type of the data we merge this data that is coming into.",
            "So in sort of tables.",
            "Now we have each sensor together and we want to join them into one into one row of data basically.",
            "And we do this separately for the sensors predictions and properties.",
            "So if you imagine that you have.",
            "I don't know 10 sensors that are all sending data by a few minutes.",
            "You can see that this table is very dense.",
            "We have a lot of measurements and a lot of obsolete data, so the next logical step is resampling this data according to the needs of the use case.",
            "In the energy scenario, this.",
            "Is usually one hour and.",
            "Now we have all these different data resampled and on the same timestamp.",
            "Which means that we have, for example, every full hour.",
            "We get a line in our in our table and then we have the meta merger component that is now able to join all these three different things together.",
            "So why don't we merch already here?",
            "It simply becausw sensors we need for the real time predictions we need for the future and properties we also need for the future.",
            "So we need to merge this in the beginning together and then already then only here we are merging all of these together.",
            "So all of this machinery is driven by a single configuration structure.",

            "Yeah, here here is for example just one error.",

            "And non working, they those really help cause if you remember yeah yeah that's obvious and the weather forecast it helps.",
            "I mean so one thing that we have found out is that the current weather does not help at all because it's too noisy data and its data for the current timestamp.",
            "Yeah, and we're predicting the future.",
            "So from from 12 to 36 hours.",
            "So each day at noon, usually all the all the energy stakeholders work like this.",
            "Each day at noon we prepare the model for the next day.",
            "So for 12:30, six, 12 hours to 36 hours ahead and the weather forecast is.",
            "If you predict for 12 powers, abilities for self powered, yeah, weather forecast is for the exactly exact timestamp.",
            "So weather weather it should not be used in this modeling weather data, but weather forecast helps helps.",
            "Understood, I think what I just asked, I think it is important to emphasize.",
            "How much different data so help you?",
            "Because it could also be that they don't help.",
            "Yeah, we have also did some of.",
            "Based on the work that Patrick was presenting before, and.",
            "Doesn't matter, we extracted some textual features out of the news Feed and we wanted to see if this helps when predicting energy prices, for example, we would consider that maybe what is going on in the media maybe could reflect the things that are going on in the energy markets.",
            "But we got worse results, for example by adding those features.",
            "Those were the frequencies like like you used, so the frequency of certain.",

            "So we knew we used event registry.",
            "There we.",
            "It's about the refugees.",
            "So in the event registry we have detected which are the relevant concepts for the energy data.",
            "This was so you took subsets based on some keywords.",
            "Yeah based on keywords.",
            "I needed any detours.",
            "Well, a little bit worse, but always worse.",

            "I think it would help.",
            "OK.",
            "Intuitively, some help just depends which which news you take, which really relates to their energy consumption.",
            "Yeah, maybe we should filter, but then again it's problem.",
            "Maybe with the frequencies, because the frequencies are already not so high when we use all the news and with just the relevant news it would be even more sparse, and then it's difficult to use it for modeling.",
            "Because it's general use, maybe it should be sense some you know to choose.",
            "Some new sources which are energy specific item problems.",
            "Also, one problem is that when you introduce three calculates frequency.",
