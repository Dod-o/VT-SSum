            "OK.",
            "Yes, OK.",

            "It's also logging the pages that you visit that you choose to visit from those queries.",

            "Adversary is W prime and the website we are trying to attack is W. OK so the adversary has information about their own log which is W prime.",
            "So they have their own access lock and this is private data, but they own it, so they have it and they can also look at the public log such as the AOL log and they can extract all the queries for the site W and then sort of say OK we have the query log for W if the search engine is important enough then they do so.",
            "This is public data.",
            "And So what one thing they could do was detect popular queries that reach both of their sites.",
            "So if they're in the same business, they can see.",
            "OK, I get more clicks for this, my my competitor doesn't get so many clicks for this and that type of thing.",
            "So the adverse adversary has background knowledge on the market which could include also user profiles and patterns of user behavior, so they could.",

            "We have the website logs.",
            "These are the privately owned logs and we have the search engine results because another thing that we have is that we can take all the queries that are published in the search engine query log and issue them live to the search engine so we can know what pages were displayed for each one of those queries.",

            "But one important thing is that K anonymity OK, it's very expensive to enforce on rapidly tainting data.",
            "And also I don't think there is a specific solution for data that transverses many different databases.",

        [
            "OK so a few words on query log anonymization well what is the problem?",

            "OK, and what are the facts about query logs?",
            "Is that the exact value can be hidden behind an anonymized value that preserves it could preserve the distribution of the value or something, but all attributes are potentially useful.",

            "Let's analyze the query or this or that, because maybe some data mining application really needs that.",

            "The problem is that maybe you anonymize one, but if you just analyze the distribution, for example, what happened on the ravikumar of paper when they analyze a token based hashing for queries?",
            "OK, they anonymized the queries and then they publish that log.",
            "You can look at the distribution of the query terms and then find what the words were exactly.",

            "So if you shuffle them then you destroy the session information.",
            "So for example, we know what sessions are.",

            "So when we publish query looks I think.",

            "Say OK, I want to sell you this information.",
            "So this is 1 adversary we could have and there's the other other adversary that is a particular competitor.",

            "One thing you have the web you truncate at website level.",
            "Yeah, OK, you truncate at website level and then for each website that you have you give them a unique ID so you can only retrace to a particular note that certain queries go to a particular site but you don't know which side they go to.",
            "You don't know the name of the site, but then you lose a lot of information because you don't know how many pages different pages in a website they visited and that sort of thing.",
