            "You have the attribute telephone or telephone number, and you have a value which is here, which would be my telephone number.",
            "So this would be a graft graft structure.",
            "A simple graph structure.",
            "If you have the RDF description compared to HTML or XML, it would look like this.",
            "So here you have the prearranged ontology logical vocabulary.",

            "Within the namespace RDF you have the description and you say something about York and what do you say?",
            "Well that the telephone number is blah blah blah so it looks very similar actually to XML and that is due to the fact that it is serialized in XML.",
            "So you can add more triples.",
            "You can say, well, this guy has a home page and this home page has a side owner which would be me.",

            "That's why you need the UI.",
            "So for example, if you want to refer to RDF as a topic, you could use the RDF website from the W3C, but as you might know, the difference between your eyes and URLs is that.",
            "Your eyes are unique resource identifier, so it should be unique and you should address uniquely certain resources, but it's not necessarily reachable in the web, and the URL typically is a uniform resource locator, so it's also addressable in the web.",

            "Certain topics like RDF in this case.",

            "Addis chemo basically and this vocabulary is organized in a so called typed hierarchy.",
            "So what you have here is clause you have a subclass of relationship.",
            "You can say type which would be an instance relationship.",
            "So here is a little bit confusing because the RDF people have a slightly different notion of what they call a property.",
            "We call a relationship what they call a class.",
            "We call the concept, but in principle it's the same.",
            "So here a property and the sub property of so also within.",

            "These are the concepts or classes and this is the property of the relationship.",
            "What do you get more by RDF Schema?",
            "So now you can say that you're actually is a type of PhD student and type is similar to instance of so York would be an instance of a PhD student.",
            "Rudy, on the other hand, would be a type of, for instance, of professor.",

            "Why is it so important that that RDF is serialized in XML?",
            "First of all, well, that gives you the flexibility to embed your meta data into XML documents, and if you have an RDF aware agent, he can make a little bit more with their document.",
            "So that's the principle idea behind it.",
            "But still it's the next step up from so called plain XML because you have, from our perspective, is small.",
            "Ontological commitment to the modeling primitives, and I introduced the basic ones and it's and it is possible to define further vocabulary that you would need for that.",
            "But what is still missing?",
            "You have no precisely described meaning that is still missing in RDF and RDF scheming schema and you have no inference model, and this is one of the key aspects.",

            "So in the ontology vocabulary you only have a simple inference model, and in the logic layer you would like to add even more inference capabilities.",
            "And if you're familiar with description logics and frame logics, then you have a clear picture of what is needed there and on top of that.",
