            "But what we noticed was that most of those above those methods to find those signatures are quite simple in nature as at least from a machine learning.",
            "Perspective, but they most of the time do is some cherry picking of genes to obtain a subset of genes that gives you then, in your particular study, the highest predicted outcome.",

            "And the idea is that we lowered the dimension of the number of genes to a dimension of let's say 1015, which are then not the jeans itself as features, but more some linear combinations that features.",
