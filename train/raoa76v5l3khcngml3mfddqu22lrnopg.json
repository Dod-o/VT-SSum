            "And ask question like how?",
            "Our ranking features like being 25 or page rank influence the sentiment in the top few.",
            "So we might expect that page rank increases or favors positive pages because positive pages may have modern links, so these are all open questions that we want to investigate.",

            "So is public opinion reflected in search results?",

            "Questions.",
            "Hi, thanks for talking, very interesting.",

            "You said you used movie review as your training set to train your linear SVM.",
            "But are you a queries?",
            "You use a 14 opinionated queries.",
            "Are your queries released to movie because in sentiment classification domain is very important.",

            "Applied to general document, no, that's a good point.",

            "Any other questions?",
            "So I have a question.",
            "So really what is a search engine to do in this case?",
            "Because so currently search engines can at least claim that they are objective and that they are ranking by topical relevance.",
            "But as long as they would, you know as soon as they would start to.",
            "To introduce diversity in a sense, you know I show half of my results, agreeing with an easier help my results not agreeing with it there somehow.",
            "Not objective anymore in the sense that they are biasing the results.",
            "So So what is a search engine to do?",
            "Yeah, so I don't know, but so I'm not saying that search engine in purpose want to buy us their users, but so also in consciously they may prefer positive documents instead of negative ones because the features they use are somehow in that direction.",
            "So I think it would be better fixing a target like.",
            "Idealistic overview of opinions and then try to to target that one.",
