            "Um?",

            "All of the burden kind of is on the user to find this perfect thing that they're looking for.",

            "So the good news is that people usually know what they like when they see it, and so one can argue that it's easier to describe style with images instead of words.",

            "This method is very straightforward.",

            "So as most of you probably already know, LDA is a generative model that specifies a probabilistic process by which your observed data is generated by.",
            "So for us we decided to model our users favourites data because this most accurately described their taste preferences or their style preferences and it also has the added advantage that it's not as sparse as our purchase data.",
            "So our reason for using LDA comes from the idea that styles on Etsy is very similar to topics in text, which is what LDA is traditionally used to model in text when you have words that Co occur frequently in a document.",
            "In many documents, this usually means that there they belong to some sort of higher level semantic topic in the same way for styles.",
            "If you have items that are frequently favorited together by users, this might.",
            "Indicate that there's some sort of underlying style that they all have in common.",
            "So in our model, each user is represented as a document.",
            "So as you can see from the figure.",
            "The page icon represents a document and each of the words in the document is basically just the listing ID of the favorited item of the user.",
            "So, just to clarify, we don't use any content from the actual listings or the items, it's literally just a list of the numerical unique listing IDs.",
            "So we assume this generative process that will generate each of the users favorite items.",
            "And before I go go through the process, we assume that, for example, we have all of the OR.",
            "We know the values of the parameters and.",
            "The most important thing here is that beta matrix, which is what?",
            "Defines each of our styles and.",
            "This is basically each style is defined as a distribution over all the items on Etsy.",
            "So assuming that we already know what that is, the process for which we generate each user's favorite items.",
            "Is.",
            "So for each user we first draw style profile for that user and this is represented by this data vector, which is basically a distribution over the case tiles that it's learned.",
            "And then for each favorite item that the user has, we draw.",
            "A style from the style profile.",

            "Parameter.",
            "And then you continue doing this and drawing items until you've drawn every single item that user has favorited.",
            "So this is the process by which we assume that favorite items are created for users and then to use this model, we basically estimate the parameters and infer the random variables and we give sampling.",
            "This is a very standard method.",

        [
            "But the takeaway here is that we learn very two very important representations, so the first is the is the style item matrix, so this is how we define our styles.",

            "Sorry, it's K styles distributed over the total listings on Etsy, and what I've shown here is just the top weighted items in each style and these should indicate that there.",
            "Most visually representative of that style, and then I've manually labeled each of these topics as whatever it seems like the images have in common.",

        [
            "On the second representation, is that style profile that's learned for each user, so this basically tells you or this is a distribution over the styles over the case styles that it's learned, and it basically tells you how strong of an interest the user has in each of these styles.",
