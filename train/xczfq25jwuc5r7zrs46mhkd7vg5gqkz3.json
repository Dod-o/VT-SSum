            "It will have.",

        [
            "As well.",

            "Thank you.",
            "Thank you, could you comment on the relationship between this and the conversion between conditional effects and having a strict planning in the sense that you are also doing this thing about introducing variables an well in in the in that conversion is by the way the one I went from level is.",
            "You have the option of preserving brand length.",
            "Personally, introducing a few variables so they said that this trade off and I expect, by the way, that you may run into into into having some performance problem because you lost structure.",
            "When you do that kind of information, introducing variables.",
            "So basically with this connection about a conditional effect strips.",
            "I can't say much.",
            "I can't say much to the.",
            "I don't know that work, so I don't know.",
            "I mean, yeah, as I said, you might be right that.",
            "If we actually applied the increased plan length might be a problem.",
            "But yeah, we have to see that.",
            "I mean, we didn't actually try anything yet.",
            "So so am I right in saying that the price you pay for the more efficient determinization is that you lose information about the probabilities of each outcome, right?",
            "Well, but in the determinization you never have any probabilities.",
            "Yeah, sure, but so suppose I want to adjust action costs to penalize, you know, low probability outcomes.",
            "Then I well, I didn't talk about cost jets because even if you only do this it's trivial.",
            "Just apply the whole cost to the very first operators in every direction and then all the others are zero.",
            "So, but I guess you could also like you still have probabilities for the single outcome you are choosing right now.",
            "And you still could apply costs inside the sequence for those, so I don't think that there is a big difference there.",
            "I even think it should be easier to.",
            "Come up with good costs then rather yeah, thanks but it's a bit speculative, but I think what in at least in posted at the end is then use determination for the FF you Ristic, right?",
            "Or well, assume you want to do that anyway.",
            "Is there anything you think that you could usefully do to exploit that you're actually going to use the delete relaxation later then?",
            "I mean, probably you don't have to be completely faithful to the.",
            "Original formulation what is the question OK?",
            "I mean, you don't stop here after the determinization you do other things you use it for something.",
            "Yeah, you use some planning Ristic and I would assume you could maybe get like better outcome if you integrate this two steps you know rather than determine I determine eyes and then for example it relax, see what actually happens like in the overall process.",
            "Like combine it somehow.",
            "Yes yes and exploit structure stuff like that, but you're not doing that now.",
            "I know we're not doing that right now at all.",
            "Sorry, one more question so you could do the determinization in different order, right?",
            "Because you have three probabilistic effect, you have 3 factorial ways of doing that, right?",
            "You said you have to observe any any impact of choosing a different order.",
            "Well, we didn't because we didn't run it yet.",
