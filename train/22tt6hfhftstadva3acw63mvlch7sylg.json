            "I'm looking at this is the systems I have to integrate with and I will hopefully show you how you can do that efficiently, but it's more like when you have information that comes in large quantities that comes fast that comes not necessary in large items that doesn't necessarily have a lot of heavyweight semantic descriptions, but where the big problem is that any processing you do is under time constraints.",
            "Now time constraints can be very rigid and I'm not.",
            "Talk about real time systems because none of these systems I'm presenting is really hard real time, but at least you should meet near real time processing constraints now, as we have heard, a lot of work and that work started 1012 years ago in the database community has been done streams now why didn't we use that?",

            "If you do a little bit a little bit heavier processing so you really have to be careful what you do on the phone and what you do.",
            "What you do in the back end, but I consider that the mobile phone is the most interesting platform for doing that because I mean on these kind of systems and on the back ends.",
            "We can do it OK, we know the environment on the phone.",
            "That gives you completely new opportunities in terms of the interface in terms of the sensing in terms of deactivating and that is really interesting.",
            "And I like the idea, for example of community or social sensing where people anonymously and they're very good approaches in doing that.",
            "Here your ID is pretty pretty well protected of solving some of the problems that would require a large investment in input into infrastructure.",
            "Like city planning, here you can do it by people participating that I really liked it out here.",
            "I think this is something cool and this is something that where we as the weapon semantic web community can contribute a lot with these infrastructures.",
            "So I see in a nutshell, yes do it's important you can do it.",
            "Not all the problems are solved and I see a lot of actually impact that you can have if you come up with cool application on the phone that does that, that will sell the web and the semantic web.",
            "I'm a scientist and I did a lot with the E Science program in the UK.",
            "And so on.",
            "And much of that was sparked off by the need for essentially streaming data from the large had drawn Collider, and so that project was the archetypal example of producing too much data to process in the conventional way.",
            "The need for streaming the need to extract, I'll call it semantics at different points down that now perhaps a general question, if we had to build that today, would it be vastly?",
            "Easier with the tools that you've told us about it, and perhaps also did we learn anything from that experience that we should be aware of when building these sorts of systems 10 or 15 years on?",
            "OK, I don't think that the system I presented would even be remotely equipped to deal with that amount of information.",
            "I mean, I don't know the Large Hadron Collider, but having worked in Switzerland and the PFL which is next door to CERN and one of my students.",
            "Working on their distributed data acquisition infrastructure, that was ten years ago.",
            "Even the amounts that were produced 1015 years ago are so beyond.",
            "Any big data that we're talking about now, and probably in the next 2000 years that I would say no.",
            "So essentially what they do and they still do is like they have extremely performant networks.",
            "I mean, when we were all having 10 megabytes, they had 100 Gigabit in place and it was hilariously expensive.",
            "So in network card that the price of a crate computer at that time.",
            "They threw away most of the data and essentially they were thinking looking into approaches.",
            "OK, how can we be reasonable sure that we don't throw away the wrong data?",
            "And how can we capture as much data as possible?",
            "And I think the same probably still holds true for the Large Hadron Collider, so that is not the type of problems I am looking at and I'm don't think that this infrastructures here can it can solve them because they're not performing enough in these kind of systems you really hard code everything very interesting, so thank you.",
            "Just one thing that bothers me a little bit about the whole concept of linked data and data streams, and that is the fact that we're told that we need to provide you our eyes for everything.",
            "And we're also told that you are eyes should be persistent and we shouldn't break the web.",
            "So with streaming data, you've obviously got a vast amount of data coming in all the time.",
            "You're allocating your eyes to that information.",
            "Presumably, how do you prevent yourself from breaking the web?",
            "Without when you're not necessarily wanting to persist all that data long term, Yep.",
            "That is a question that OK from in terms of efficiency, it's easy.",
            "I mean, it's essentially only identification and you can generate that on the fly.",
            "You can do it in binary for months, done in terms of modeling.",

            "My answer is I don't know.",
            "I let you guys figure that out.",
            "So I give you something where you can actually test your theories.",
            "Probably you will.",
            "The result of these tests will be OK.",
            "The model of the web that exists so far cannot be applied to streams, and it actually breaks the web.",
            "Now.",
            "Is this something better?",
            "Something good?",
            "I see this is.",
            "I think this is something good because it tests your model.",
            "And if you figure out that you can't model something, then you have two decisions you to say OK, do I want to model that because you also have to be careful that if you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.",
            "So don't use the hammer for every nail you come across, or you say this is actually a valid problem.",
            "Now let us think about how we can actually introduce that into our model in the way that causes the least disruption with the existing systems.",
            "But you're absolutely right.",
            "Yep, but.",
            "I don't know.",
            "OK.",
            "If I had a question before the coffee break.",
            "So I will only have justified and that final question and just just for you to to regret to have answered this.",
            "What do you think I mean from going from this?",
            "A scientific experiments where lots of data being generated to industrial applications where there are lots of sensors and also the citizen sensing part where I mean which is growing, which is the one that you think that in five years or 10 years will be the type of data that has that probably has.",
            "Grown much more than the other ones.",
            "I wouldn't tell you because I would find the company and make a shit load of money with it.",
            "So now but without choking, I honestly don't know yet.",
            "I I think you know, for example when the when the web was originally conceived, it was a conceived for a different purpose and people didn't know where it actually should lead.",
            "But there's one important lesson that we have to learn from that you have to create an environment which allows other people to be creative.",
            "So I trust in you guys, in my PhD students in developers that if I provide them an interesting infrastructure.",
            "Dave will come up with actually interesting solutions to interesting problems, but let me emphasize the important thing is that it's out there, a system that's not implemented doesn't exist.",
            "In a system that's not freely available doesn't exist.",
            "I will give you one example where this is.",
            "This is shown very obviously when the web started, there was actually a better proposal around.",
            "Also, hypertext links forward backward multimedia was covered, everything.",
            "But it wasn't open source.",
            "Who of you still does not knows Hyperwave?",
            "Oh, there are some people who know hyperwave, so technically speaking, that was the far superior system, but it didn't give you a easy to access infrastructure.",
            "The web was actually far the web service that we now use in the beginning were far less powerful.",
            "So I would say 10 years ahead in terms of in terms of the development.",
