            "Basically everybody is connected to everybody else, but then as soon as you go to K = 6 or 7, you just get this really steep drop and then from there on out.",
            "It's actually, you know there's a little bit of a dip, but it's pretty stable, which is a little bit surprising.",
            "So sort of in some sense what's going on here is, you know if I have 5 interest in common with you, it's it's basically meaningless in terms of trying to develop a community, you're looking at something like that, but once you get to K = 6 or 7.",

        [
            "I'm out of your personal opinion what each is.",

            "And So what this says is that you know if lots of lots, lots of web pages have lots of ads in common.",
            "But once you get to six or seven ads in common, it's starting to say there's something interesting about those two of those two advertise.",
            "I'm sorry those two web pages now when you go to the right hand side.",
            "This is our Flickr photographs and here photos are users in tags or interests.",

            "You know, some if you have two photos that share 6 or 7 interest, there are six or seven tags in common.",

        [
            "OK, and just two more grass, so again here you know it was a little surprising to us 'cause we just sort of through these things at the KFC Platten.",
            "We actually got kind of very different plots in our minds.",
            "So on the left hand side you get connectivity that really smoothly varies which is a little bit surprising.",
            "So whether you look at 10 interests or 15 interests or 20 interests, there's still a lot of connectivity structure going on the graph.",
            "So we kind of think of this very heavy tailed and this graph it drops much more suddenly.",
            "But there's still sort of this sweet spot of.",
            "Between you know 5 to 15.",
            "There's a lot of connectivity structure and then basically goes away by the time you get to 36, but it's a much.",

        [
            "Here on the left hand side, this is actually the Yahoo queries graph where again users are users and queries are interest here, and it's really surprising because the average user this is over a 70 day span, the average user issued about 40 queries and we're seeing connectivity structure even for 50 queries, which is sort of a big surprise for us.",
            "So very very heavy tailed.",

            "You know, here again, you're sort of we're sort of seeing this story that I have a few interesting, with you.",
            "It doesn't mean too much in terms of the overall communities, but you know when you go to 10 or 15.",

            "Thing on the top.",
            "That's the naive algorithm, and ours is this red thing, so you know, even if you have millions of nodes, it works in a few minutes or less.",
            "And this thing just shot off into space.",
            "It was like for 300,000 nodes he started to be hours and hours long, so you know we're getting factors of for K = 2, we're getting factors of 1000 speed up."

        [
            "So what's surprising, sort of asymptotically or implementation doesn't seem that much better, right?",
            "It's M to the 2 -- 1 / K time, so for K = 2, that's M to the three halves, but we're sort of using some nice properties here.",
            "If social social networks, first of all, very, very sparse.",
            "So this M is kind of like en la Ganesh and second of all, the algorithm that we use actually is faster for power law distribution without any change in the algorithm.",
            "It's just an automatic thing of the way the algorithm works and the other nice properties is very very fast for K = 2.",
