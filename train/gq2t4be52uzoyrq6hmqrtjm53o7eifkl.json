            "And actually it's true that when I say I mean for most of the approaches in vascular machine pattern recognition, once you're supposed to have positive and negative examples, may desperation and it's true that in practice we have very few of these non negative examples.",
            "Simply I think once against the problem of these approaches we at least for the ones we use within the activity and also we we found proxies to generate once like when you want to have interactions you say that.",

            "OK, so you generate negative examples.",
            "I think the good and so would rather be to to use more adaptive methods that don't need negative examples, but that would typically be based on the idea that among all possible pairs there is a very limited amount of positive examples an you know you have some like you could use one class SVM's or just density estimator.",
            "So whatever this may be more relevant and so I think that the solution should be to change the method in order not to use negativism.",
            "That would generate, but also.",
            "In practice.",
            "I mean, I've tested different approaches in other problems and it's not clear when you have only positive examples whether it's better just to use the positive examples and a method that uses this, or to generate negative once and use binary ones in terms of final curiosity.",
            "For instance, sometimes the one wins, sometimes other one win, so I have no religion there, but it's true that there is a symmetry here.",
