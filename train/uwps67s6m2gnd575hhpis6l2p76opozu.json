            "But still and you can, it is possible to see that the the instances.",
            "So the Java classes that are grouped together in this leaves here have similar names.",

            "Document Document format or here you can see that all the words end with E. MPL, which stands for implementation.",

            "For example, this word implementation should be somewhere else, should not be together with session implementation or Ajit adjective implementation, cause these are completely different concepts.",
            "So that's why in Latino it is possible to include or to exclude different kinds of information.",
            "So, and if we include another type of structural information, for example, this, this is now the semantic space where we included only the type reference structural information.",
            "So this is now a different kind of information.",
            "You can see that the space is different, it has less less obvious islands.",
            "But the instances are more scattered, and if we now.",

            "First level concepts in the same way as we did before.",
            "You will see that these concepts are different, are completely different.",
