            "This is transparent for most of us.",
            "So here is another illustration that risk can be communicated in a transparent, easy to understand way, or in a way that's also correct.",

            "This one news increased the number of abortions in England and Wales in the following year by 13,000.",

            "So what we need in our society is to teach.",
            "The next generation.",
