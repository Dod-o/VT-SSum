            "So first of all, fo ID presents a strong semantic integration of 1st order logic and rules, so there is nothing hybrid going on here.",
            "It's not one on top of the other or something.",

            "And the final point is that FJD.",
            "Integrates rules with first order logic in a way which is quite natural from the perspective of description logics WHI well.",
            "For instance, you see here on the slide this quote about the failed code basically says that the ability to properly define concepts so at least to define concept using a full equivalence and not just stating a necessary condition is considered to be very typical for description, logic and one of the most powerful features of these languages."
        ],
        [
            "OK, so now what we want to do here is look at FO ID as a basis for extensions of description logics with rules, so this kind of difference from what people usually do in the sense that people usually start from a description, logic and then kind of add stuff to do so at for instance rule to this or other things we're going to do is we're going to start from this quite general language of FO ID which encompases 1st order logic in full and which has rules which allow arbitrary 1st order formulas in the body.",

            "Which has proven very useful in practice and for which they also offer a very intuitive syntactic sugar, making it very easy, very natural, to write down knowledge in this language.",

        [
            "Fragments of 1st order logic.",
            "So we see that this first property is a property of knowledge representation, so it's property that comes into play when we are trying to write theory and the 2nd is a property of computation.",
            "So it's something that comes into play once we've already written the theory, and I want to proceed to do something with it, which means that to a certain extent this can be considered to be kind of somewhat orthogonal concerns."
        ],
        [
            "OK, so in our paper we've presented a concrete proposal so concrete fragment of FO ID, which is the basic description logic ACI extended with a couple of things.",
            "So the first thing that we extended with our constructs for representing inductive definitions, obviously.",
            "So we have here the two that you see on the slide.",
            "So the first one is a way of writing down Singleton definitions.",
            "So just definitions consisting of a single rule and we just translate this to FJD definition, which means that the meaning of this is the same as the standard equivalence as long as the definition that you are writing down is non inductive.",
            "But of course the difference is that this new construct that we introduce here will also work for inductive definitions where standard 1st order equivalence doesn't work.",
            "Then we also add a second construct which allows you to write down definitions consisting of multiple rules, which is convenient because it often makes it easier to tell at a glance what the particular structure is of an inductive definition.",
            "So which are the base cases?",
            "Which is the inductive step?",
            "And so on.",
            "And it makes it also easier to update the definition if you later want to add an additional case or remove the case that you already had.",
            "So in addition to this, we also had two neuro constructors, so we had this kind of dot connective that allows you to say, well, are one dot or two in order to meet in one of our two.",
            "So you can use this to write down stuff like Uncle is a brother of apparent.",
            "And again, this is just translated to.",
            "This is just translated to FJD in the obvious way and we also allow you to construct a role that is the Cartesian product of two concepts.",

        ],
        [
            "Now we believe that this language is quite description logic like in the sense that it admits a description logic like modeling style, and then it offers a nice syntactic sugar to support this particular modeling style.",
            "The only difference is of course that we have these more expressive definitions.",

        ],
        [
            "Next section, but first maybe you work about the computational side of things.",
            "So this language that we have defined is undecidable in itself.",
            "And of course, it doesn't mean that it's not useful, because there are plenty of things that you can also do with undecidable languages.",
