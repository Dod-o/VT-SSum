            "Yeah, you have using our approach to target.",
            "Manually and probably even do check for errors and press that and then this was the ground truth right?",

            "It was not about to re ring or the rankings attack right?",
            "It's not about doing things, is ranking of the tag using the ranked tag 22 tagging.",

            "So that then I think there are two different things right?",
            "So you objective the objective of Microsoft in this case is very simple.",
            "I want to give the best user experience in this ranking and if I take my images, yeah, I know I know you'll consider.",

            "If you compare the PSTN, then keep the using the idea.",
            "It's an interesting, interesting comparison.",
            "Yeah, they're using multiple users, so yeah.",
            "But I don't think people want to play the game the second time is boring is very naughty things.",

            "I will talk about something about that later.",
            "So you ask?",
            "OK, sorry, the first question is about what it is very hard to answer on.",
            "Thank you my viewpoint.",
            "It can be measured.",
            "By the search performance.",
            "You know, because Microsoft is running search engine, so I think this is A at least one way to evaluate whether attack is good or not.",

            "Evaluate.",
            "The quality of the tag, but evaluate it when people using the tag to search the image.",
            "I mean, it's the relevance of the search result based on the tag of the image.",
            "I'm not sure I answered your question or not.",
            "But this is probably.",
            "And very question, but I think I'm just really have to pay attention to it and maybe think about pretty because whatever you have to optimize, we'd mention, yeah.",
            "And it could be somebody saying something or somebody saying something else, and we don't think we had happened.",
            "So we need metrics and.",
            "It's not easy to find that I agreed with.",
            "This definitely is easy to include.",
            "Second set is left, but.",
            "Is it mainly the question then it turns into if it is relevant, is this a key aspect or or?",
            "If not, maybe we can just?",
            "If we think about the, I think the one of the key application of tagging is search.",
            "So that's why I said the search relevance could be one of the measures of the quality of the tag.",
            "Anyway, this is maybe you want this just to make sure that it's so in your case because you are interested of tagging, he is in search.",
            "If I understand well, you are suggesting that it doesn't really matter whether coding whether these people, if they had, has the highest quality or not, as long as research has the highest quality right in this.",
            "Yeah, at least it could be 1.",
            "One of the measures to reflect the quality of the tag.",
