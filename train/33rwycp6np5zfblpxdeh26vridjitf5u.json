            "You know we had several hundred groups participate in that, and those datasets are one of the artifacts that are left each year with his community.",

            "I'm announcing it today is another not for profit called the Open Science Data Cloud has made available about 800 terabytes growing to a petabyte over the next month or two of completely Open Access data that's available to the Community.",
