            "So first of all we, we thought about what are the main challenges companies face today and this is of course from our perspective with the focus of on it is the problem that accompany user usually has to has to integrate several IT systems such as usually they have an ERP system, they have PDM PLM systems.",
            "They have me as systems and in order to process orders.",
            "Throughout the supply chain and the company it's quite important to integrate all those.",
            "Systems, but nowadays the system integration fails usually, especially if you talk about the connection between the supplier and and the customer and the specific relationships.",
            "For that reason, order processing nowadays is often performed via faxes or.",

            "And actually this is 1 main cause of the bullwhip effect.",

            "There some deviations in the demand, but what usually happens is that if you go upstream towards the supplier those deviations increase.",
            "And this is true to a lot of lot of reasons, which are for example listed here.",
            "You have very often the problem that information are just processed locally.",
            "So usually the supplier here has no idea of what is happening at the customer site point of sale date data are not available for example.",
            "And yeah, the missing information exchanged between all the members of the supply chains leads to this effect.",

            "Addressing the bullet effect, maybe some of you might know the be again the beer game now is a game which.",
            "Helps to understand how the bull Vic bullwhip effect occurs and helps to understand what are the main problems that causes bullwhip effect.",
            "So the idea of the beer game once more is to have a supply chain consisting of four.",
            "Companies, and usually this is played physically on a table where every player has a has a sheet, has some.",
            "That's called via game, has some.",
            "How do you call it the beer?",
            "The beer caps exactly as some beer caps and they have to deal with the beer caps so they have to fulfill the orders.",
            "Coming in by their customers, which is just another player having the same setup of a company with with an inventory and production and they have to fulfill the orders of their customers and they have to order of course or ensure that they are supplied.",
            "Due to these orders and overall the idea of the game is that everybody or every single company, every single player has to find the balance between the fulfillment of orders and the are very low level of inventory as they always have to face costs, inventory costs, costs of course, but if you fail to fulfill in all the order, you even have to pay twice.",
            "So this is just the idea of the game, so you have to imagine that there are now four players, four people sitting in a row and we at the organizer just say OK. Now the marked demands for beer cups and then the first the retailer retailer for example, now has to.",
            "Fulfill this order and at the same time he asks his supplier for the for those caps and this is what happens.",
            "What happens throughout this chain and what always happens in this game is that inventory stocks explode like they they don't have all the information necessary then which are?",
            "They don't have all the information they need to manage their orders in a very good way so.",
            "For example, if you just go through the other end of the supply chain at the very very first supplier, he does not know what happens at the at the point of sale in these terms.",
            "And when we as organizer increase the amount of caps from 4 to 8, for example, it takes several rounds of Plato.",
            "This supplier knows about what is happening at the point of sale and due to the bullwhip effect you will not know about in.",
            "What amount we increased the demand, but he will just realize OK Now my customer.",
            "Asks me for maybe 20 Beer cups which is typical effect of the bullwhip effect cause.",
            "This demand increases its deviation.",
            "So this view game we usually play physically and now the idea was to play it with the ERP systems.",
            "So this is what we're doing actually here now.",
            "What you what you can see here now is that we have several ERP systems installed on our server and we connected them.",
            "We are my open factory.",
            "Actually you cannot see that because it's software somehow, but this is what you have to imagine.",
            "If you see those those monitors monitors on the on the bottom line, for example, now it's just three ERP systems here, but.",
            "I don't want to play it now, but the idea now is said every year P system is connected via EDI via the My Open factory standard and what we now can do is to play the beer game.",
            "Using the ERP system.",
            "So if people come from industry and we talk about those theoretic stuff like Bullwhip effect, be a game OK baby again they usually understand but like bullet effect and all that stuff, it's hard for them to grab what it's all about and it's hard for them to transfer it to their daily work.",
            "So the idea now is to to help them to do so, and for example they can.",
            "We can we have some more ERP systems on our server we can.",
            "Tell a company like I don't know.",
            "Siemens maybe well come to Fr.",
            "Sit down here we will.",
            "Provide your ERP system with some customization as well, and now we can play the beer game and maybe you can do that with your suppliers.",
            "So we invite not only the Siemens people but we invite also their suppliers and their customers.",
            "So we invite the whole supply chain and we.",
            "Let them take take place and let them play the beer game and so this is just a visualization of what is happening.",
            "So what you see here is is 1 company.",
            "One monitor is 1 company, one vertical X axis is 1 company and.",
            "You see here now what is what is the status in sales?",

            "Is procurement what is?",
            "What are the pieces which are ordered?",
            "What are the pieces pieces which will be delivered?",
            "And now you can place your orders by making use of the ERP systems and we also established a connection between those two.",
            "Monitors or between the visualization in the beer game thinking and.",
            "Now they can start to play, so they start to play and we still we still play play somehow God and we still.",
            "Introduce the demand of the market into the supply chain and they have to react and try to balance their inventories and their order fulfillment.",
            "They still might struggle in doing so, so of course there are a lot of concepts nowadays discussed in theory, like vendor managed inventory for example, or quick response or stuff like that.",
            "And we also.",
            "Enable, know or provide for each player the opportunity to buy such a concept.",
            "For example, if this producer guy here says OK, I'd like to.",
            "Like to know about the point of sale data, he may.",
            "Made by quick response.",
            "By in terms of the costs in the game, in the end will when we finish the game we will say OK. Actually, which supply chain chain perform perform best?",
            "So this is just one supply chain?",
            "You see it here, it's just the yellow background is just the yellow supply chain, for example, now we have four supply chains.",
            "They can be played and played at different locations.",
            "And now we can say OK, each supply chain has two has two.",
            "Oh, there's a competition between the supply chains, so in the end we'll have a look at which supply chain performed best an in terms of costs, of course.",
            "So each supply chain and each member of the supply chain has to think about OK, do I want to do?",
            "I want to invest some money in vendor managed inventory or in quick response.",
            "And what will I get from it?",
            "So for example, I just said this, this guy here thought about buying quick response.",
            "So in reality he would.",
            "Have made an investment maybe to get to know about the point of sale data and now what you see here is just an information he can make use of in the game.",
            "Knowing about what is happening on the point of sale exactly or it's exactly.",
            "It's an aggregation of what is already ordered and what he already provided so he can see the gap or is still missing.",
            "So maybe what is still coming up throughout the chain cause maybe he sees OK there are 100.",
            "Items or pieces have have been ordered at the point of sale in total, but I just.",
            "Shipped.",
            "40 for example, so 60 seems to be missing and although his customer might not already have placed an order of those 60 item, he can already try to do.",
            "Or you can already order the missing items to be able to fulfill the upcoming order which he's expecting.",
            "So this is the idea of the game and besides quick response they can also buy VMI or some other concepts and.",

            "At the moment, I think another idea has been presented.",

            "Providing this information into ERP systems, but what we're talking about now, sorry, is about establishing the connection between all those members of the supply chain and then again we can talk about supply concepts or concepts like vendor managed inventory, quick response which can be implemented in this case, which we will.",

            "So that would be a really innovative environment.",
