I think we've got the beginnings of data on this is that there's a very interesting problem coming up where there's getting to be through the use of tools like such as Twitter that he used that maybe that are used by internal people, but with an external audience some erosion of boundaries between public and private and internal and external an even though the people that were in our study understood certain.",
            "Elements of those boundaries, such as confidentiality, who knows what the broader implications are of blurring those kinds of those kinds of boundaries, and those are some of the kinds of things that I think are really interesting to look for with the growth of social media, particularly growth by enterprise users.",
