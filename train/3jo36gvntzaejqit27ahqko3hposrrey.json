            "My wife says psychologist and psychotherapist and I always say to her and her friends that I think it's a great pity that psychologists are not working with the national psyche because as you're describing so well, the state of the national psyche has a huge influence on what actually happens in the country.",
            "As we know historically, for example, the Frankfurt School in Germany, Erich Fromm, Hannah Rent, these sorts of people, the 1920s were people who worked with the national psyche.",
            "By and large, we don't have that anymore, and I think that's extremely damaging.",
            "So because, as you say, when we come to realize how will we come to realize how will be enabled to come to realize.",
            "And this is and it's not just psychologists, sociologists, economists, anthropologists all have.",
            "Artists are role to play.",
            "So we need to address that purposely.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Who would like to take the story further on?",
            "I would just like to add a short comment on on what the colleague before me said maybe.",
            "In a kind of joke.",
            "Maybe that's why this Louise don't ask so many questions, don't.",
            "Go into a debate because.",
            "We we are.",
            "So, introverted, maybe that's.",
            "Just it, yeah, just again.",
            "One thought on your thought.",
            "Yesterday we had one of our I think 5 presentations and a very large room and until the last half hour it was exactly as you said.",
            "Nobody asking questions and so on.",
            "So we totally changed the shape of the room right?",
            "We put everybody in a circle.",
            "No disks.",
            "And gradually the whole thing began to transform.",
            "And yet so often I find we sit in desks and tables and rows and that doesn't help the introverted personality.",

            "My question is how do you?",
            "Put in the input into.",
            "Practice all these principles.",
            "They are pretty common to the permaculture principles.",

            "I can I can only see this implementing in small communities.",
            "How do you?",
            "How did you implement this in, let's say, Africa?",
            "OK, and maybe I'll start with the practical how we did it and then couple of words about what are the general principles in Africa and Zimbabwe.",
            "It all started with this one particular rural project and shanica the one I described to you where 300,000 people are growing their own food.",
            "If you want to say well how did that start?",
            "It started with a Masters program.",
            "We were running a Masters program in South Africa on social and economic transformation.",
            "Now two things about that.",
            "Firstly, the Masters program was focused on social and economic transformation, not an MBA.",
            "I'm a Harvard graduate of the MBA.",
            "I graduated from the London School of Economics.",
            "Those are very limited places, right?",
            "So we said we need a program on social and economic transformation to Zimbabweans joined the program.",
            "The story went on from there.",
            "Secondly, the whole program was built around projects.",
            "The program wasn't built around courses, it was built around projects and people then gained knowledge which and then informed the projects the projects were individual, organizational and societal transformation.",
            "The two year part Time Masters is all focused on individual organizational and societal transformation.",
            "These two Zimbabweans rarely took up the challenge.",
            "They were in a country which had 1,000,000% inflation at the time and their lives were in turmoil.",
            "They had a motivation to do something about it.",
            "OK.",
            "The thing then grows.",
            "3000 people, 5000 people, 100,000 people and then we say to them actually their name is mature.",
            "Any machinery pain?",
            "Carter is not going to work because this is just jenica.",
            "It's one small community within Zimbabwe we need.",
            "An educational transfer transformation program and process.",
            "Great, they said we'll make it happen.",
            "Teamed up, transform Davinci Institute and the local organization.",
            "We started a doctoral program.",
            "Now doctor PhD.",
            "Very clever stuff.",
            "Absolutely not.",
            "The doctoral program was to cross catalyze the transformation.",
            "So we now have 40 people.",
            "From politics from the corporate sector, from the NGOs, from small businesses from communities I have to say when they first join the program.",
            "I'm under doctoral program my I'm going to be a doctor.",
            "Yeah, clever guy, me big big individual.",
            "And then we start off and we say you've got the wrong story.",
            "That's not why you're here.",
            "You're here to transform your society and in the process to transform yourself.",
            "Now the second thing, because I think this is important for your question.",
            "The very organizers of the program said, well, chanika really doesn't have very much to do with it here.",
            "There, here to do a doctoral program, and I said she Dara you as the Co creator of Tanika you got it wrong and we will show you an the first session we did with the people.",
            "I sort of talked to them, got to know them, and said have you guys heard about Jenica?",
            "Anybody know about sneaker?",
            "Nobody really knew about Jenica.",
            "Talked about them.",
            "I'm from the corporate sector.",
            "I'm the travel company.",
            "And then all of a sudden I want to go back to the land every single person on the program said I've got a farm.",
            "I've got a ruler area.",
            "I remember where I came from.",
            "And now we have 40 people from all walks of life who are all working on process of transformation to build versions of chanika in the political realm.",
            "In the economic realm, in the technology realm, we've got a huge technology project, we call it not Silicon Valley, but Jenica Valley.",
            "We want to build Jenica Valley, so we have turned a doctoral program on it said why?",
            "Because in the doctoral program, our doctoral programs are all for mature practitioners.",
            "They're all average 40 years old.",
            "Most of them are quite senior.",
            "You've got people for four years of their life.",
            "To transform themselves, their organisations and their societies were doing the same thing.",
            "Now in Nigeria.",
            "So as a practical way forward, that is, if you like our recipe of how you take such a process and practically forward and then sort of generalize what that means.",
            "That's why I feel so strongly about a kind of University being at the center of this, because you bring people together from different.",
            "Context they come together, they see the world and so on.",
            "They see their world.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Conference.",
            "You mean the doctorate?",
            "Now, this gathering of people you mean in Zimbabwe are we back to here?",
            "In Zimbabwe, it's a four that they're doing their PhD their doctorate over four years.",
            "Right, they each have their projects to work on and they meet together regularly in groups to take the project forward.",
            "So the purpose of the PhD is to renew their society.",
            "That is the singular purpose of the PhD.",
            "Of course, in the process they learn a lot.",
            "They get to know people, they transform their organizations.",
            "One person from Nigeria, one single person who works in the bank in Nigeria is working together with others on the transformation of the whole of the country.",
            "Is a guy of 32 years old.",
            "He started by creating the Islamic Bank.",
            "You know about Islamic non interest banking and build from there.",
            "Then got a community of people around him because he said we in Africa are going to show the world that banking for us can be different and starting in Nigeria so again there on that kind of doctoral program so that I'm not saying that's the ultimate ago but you asked me about how we go about it and that's how we go about in Slovenia.",
            "We're doing it a bit the other way around.",
            "We're starting by networking into many different walks of life.",
            "That was the second part of your.",
            "Question because you always start by recognizing who you are and where you are, so you recognize current examples of a green integral economy.",
            "That's what you've seen.",
            "OK, so you start from there and then you say, how can we build on what we have already and learn from the rest of the world.",
            "So in this sense, what you just presented us this project in Zimbabwe.",
            "What would be your suggestion too?",
            "Where to start hearing Slovenia from the grassroots level in in the sense of integral economy.",
            "The only idea I have for now is from social entrepreneurship or.",
            "Yeah, you know, to answer your question, I I'm always interested in in the Soul Force within a society, and I've heard particularly from dire that for example, social entrepreneurship, social responsibility, green economy on the European map.",
            "So that's a good place to start.",
            "You start with what's actually on the map, but over and above that you say what lives in the psyche of a particular society.",
            "And I'm not really doing a lot of reading of leading thinkers in Slovenia, and I can see that the other forces that live within this society.",
            "And these other forces I would identify as such elements as system dynamics and historically self management.",
            "So somehow you have to marry up the dynamics of your SoC with.",
            "If you like, you know what the rest of the world is anticipating from.",
            "So that's number one.",
            "This marriage between who we are and who we expect it to be.",
            "OK, this is the second is much easier than the first.",
            "The second thing is just to avoid sort of misleading when I talk of a doctoral program and this is something that consider Slovenia could maybe take on from the grassroots.",
            "The leading figure in this jenica this project where 300,000 people now have livelihoods.",
            "Incidentally, they have livelihoods.",
            "They don't have jobs.",
            "They're very fulfilling livelihoods.",
            "They work three days a week, and the rest of the time they have theater, poetry, dance, music.",

            "Now of course she's not working alone as a woman of Zimbabwe.",
            "They called Moshe as a woman of Zimbabwe.",
            "They work as a collective.",
            "It's very interesting also that is a women's collective because formerly the men have the power.",
            "We've actually been there.",
            "We've seen it.",
            "The woman sit on the ground and the men sit on seats.",
            "But informally, the women have all the power.",
            "They are the ones who really make things happen, so she and her power collective and remember there dealing with the most unbelievable political forces.",
            "Can you imagine in Zimbabwe today to make this kind of thing happens?",

            "What what equivalent award is she going to get?",
            "Because PhD doesn't quite fit.",
