            "The first component are the jobs on the market.",
            "And the other component are the workers.",
            "So if you look at these components, you see that they.",

            "So for example, for each job you have a set of skills which is required for completing that job.",
            "And also it has a value that you gain once the job is completed.",
            "Workers, on the other hand, they have some salary which if you hire them, you have to pay them that my salary and also they have a set of skills that they Masters and they can use them to do the jobs so clearly in this setting there is a matching problem you have to bring the workers do their jobs and create some values.",
            "And that's what companies try to do.",

            "These are the projects they can do."

        [
            "But the most important question is how do you make money right?",

            "The performance of our method under both models.",

            "You can go after you can apply for it, get the job and get the money.",

        [
            "So because of that we have a different model which is the competition based model.",

            "So these are the other number of people who can also participate in that job because they have that rare skill.",
            "Alright.",
            "So now that we answered these questions, we are ready to define our problem.",
            "The first problem that we've defined is called cluster hire and basically the question is that if you have a fixed budget.",

            "So in the paper, we show that this problem is NP hard to solve and approximate within any factor.",

            "Because there is a close connection with the set cover problem, so you can read about that on the paper.",
            "But this problem formulation is a little bit far from reality, because what happens is that workers are spread thin, meaning that you might ask a worker to do many jobs because simply because he had the right, the skills you say, OK, there are hundred jobs on the market that you can call that go and do all of them, which is not practical."
        ],
        [
            "So we define a different version of the problem and we look more into that which we call T cluster hire.",
            "So what it does is it basically limits the problem formulation a little bit further and says a worker can use his skill in at most he projects.",
            "And usually pick a reasonable number 40 like two or three projects at the same time.",
            "So in this case, the notion of coverage changes because your team can cover many projects, but you have to select which ones you want to do.",
            "It turns out that this selection problem is also hard, but we can do a greedy approach to basically evaluate that.",
            "Alright, now that I discuss about the problem and the complexity of the results, I'm going to present to you some of the algorithms that we have."
        ],
        [
            "So the first algorithm that we studied is called expert greedy.",
            "So what it does is that it basically.",
            "Tries to pick the best expert at each iteration.",
            "Adds it to the team that you already have right and the best expert is basically the expert that maximize that maximizes the profit to cost ratio, and you repeat this until the budget is completely consumed.",
            "And if you look at that example, the power of this algorithm is using the skills that already your team has.",
            "So for example, in this particular example you see job on the market that requires Java web design and graphic design.",
            "What you already have Java.",
            "Web design in your team.",
            "These are the skills covered by your team, so you basically hire someone with graphic design and you can now complete that job, right?"
        ],
        [
            "So basically the expected he says I can pick Austin and I can earn that value, while if I go after different go after other workers I have to pay 10 but I still cannot complete any jobs.",
            "So the top one is the one that expectedly chooses.",
            "So the other Al Gore."
        ],
        [
            "Item is called project greedy.",
            "So project really tries to, you know differently, picks the best project at each iteration and try to do this until the budget is console.",
            "So once you pick a project, you have to define the cost, how many workers you need to hire.",
            "So project Greedy knows the skills that you already have, knows the skills that you need to be able to cover that project, and it tries to find the best team that basically can cover that.",
            "So this is a set cover problem, weighted set cover problem, but you can do a greedy approach to find a good approximation of that, and that's what we do.",
            "So the intuition here is that when you consider projects, you can basically, in other words, consider a combination of workers to be hired.",
            "So for example, in this case this is the same example, but I basically increase the value of the second project, which expected doesn't pick.",
            "Because expected, it looks like that and it says I have to pay for two workers to be able to get that and it cannot see, you know beforehand, it hires the first one and doesn't see any profit.",
            "What project you can pick that project and see that you know yes, you need to hire two people, but once you hire those two people, you get a much more profit because you see the whole profit for the project.",
            "So in that sense, project greedy has a better, you know.",

        [
            "So the last algorithm that we consider is click greedy.",

            "The first one requires Java web design and SQL and the second one only requires Java and web design.",

            "Based on the workers that I listed over there.",

        [
            "If you put these things together, the cost doesn't actually go up, so it seems very natural that you always go after these two projects together.",
            "Because basically by combining them you get a much better profit to cost ratio.",
            "So that's what we do.",
            "We basically find these compatible projects and we get a click of these projects and we say, you know, they're all together.",

            "But on their competition based model there is a sudden drop.",

            "You know, hiring an expert cannot do as much projects, so it's more simply look at the projects, the profitable projects, and pick them.",

        [
            "And basically, if you compare this with the workers similarity, you will see that the reason is that in Group you have a lot of similar workers and that's the dense clusters you see in the middle, because they are all similar.",
