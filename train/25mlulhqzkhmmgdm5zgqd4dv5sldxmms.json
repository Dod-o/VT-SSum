            "'cause I was.",
            "Unprepared for it and I was challenged 24 hours a day to learn, but it was also the most positive learning experience.",
            "Because their lifelong lessons that I carry with me that I'm able, I'm still able to speak those languages.",
            "I'm able to know more people.",
            "I'm able to travel, travel, and learn about different parts of the world, so those are really positive experiences and they stay with me and I think it's likely that you're more sensitive to people who don't know English when you're in an English environment and understanding what they're going through.",
            "Yeah, very, very true.",
            "Certainly it's very humbling.",
            "Experience to be the only person in the room who doesn't understand or the only person in the room who can't speak, and that's not something that I grew up with.",
            "So being in that situation for many years as a learner of other languages was very enriching and does certainly doesn't make me more sensitive.",
            "Would anyone else like to contribute?",
            "I can relate to that.",
            "I did have some challenges high, especially you know when I moved to another country.",
            "Have it a little English background and I wanted to say something, but I was too nervous to say because I don't know how people will take that as if I make mistakes.",
            "But anyway, my most challenging learning experiences elearning IT stuff at work, constantly learning new things and that is really positive experience as well for me because I learned so many skills which I can use everyday life.",
            "And if I go back five years ago, if I retired five years ago and then come back to work after five years, there's no way I would cope.",
            "Because there's so much I meant and that is challenging as well as most positive learning experience for me.",
            "Very good.",
            "That is, I think many educators as they go along in their careers feel the same way you do, that it's a constant change and.",

            "Around the new technology and staying connected with students.",
            "My most challenging learning experience was calculus in college and no.",
            "Now I understand that the problem was that my learning style and the teachers, the professors instructional style were so different that it was like we were speaking different languages.",
            "I did not understand anything that he was sharing with me, and so after a lot of time and time spent in office hours, I was able to, you know.",
            "Successfully complete calculus, but because we were not, I couldn't understand how he was teaching.",
            "I couldn't learn.",
            "And in terms of positive learning experience, I'd have to say that was 7th grade with Mr. Koes.",
            "It was science and the reason it was such a great learning experiences because it was contextualized and applied.",
            "And when Robert told me that his grades six and eight have iPads, I thought about how that can completely transform the learning experience with all the ways that the learning can be applied to contextualize Dan that totally changed my life, that one class in 7th grade.",
            "And made me as a girl.",
            "Realize I could do science and maybe appeal to the school board to be able to take engineering classes because girls weren't allowed to take them and so that then.",
            "And so I think about Robert, where you're going to be able to do and how you're going to be able to create such great learning experiences through that technology and the teaching and learning process.",
            "And that makes such a difference.",
            "Is him.",
            "Most challenging learning experience.",
            "How?",
            "Very very difficulties for the teacher to change learning practice from ordinary to active learning and creative thinking.",
