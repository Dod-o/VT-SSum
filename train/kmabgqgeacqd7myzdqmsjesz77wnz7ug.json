            "They slow down the system, so for the for the scales that we were looking at, which were at level of, you know.",
            "So it depends a little on which particular part we're talking about.",

            "Quite a bit more scale up from that.",
            "OK, so that hasn't been at this point a point of emphasis, but in fact it's one of the things that we are looking at is really trying to build it at much higher scale.",
