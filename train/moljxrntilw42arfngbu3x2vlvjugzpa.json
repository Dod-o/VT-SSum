            "So if you do that, you are the requester, so you are the person who creates a project or has a project and you try to break it down into smaller pieces that we're going to call micro tasks.",
            "Or in this platform we call them human intelligent tasks or hits.",
            "So this hits are going to be available in Mechanical Turk an we have some crowd or workers who are willing to solve our task.",
            "Of course, for exchange of monetary rewards and they will spend some time they will work on the task, submit their answers, and then the requesters tried to discern whether the answer from this person is good enough.",
            "So I can approve or reject a task.",
            "And finally, when all your micro tasks or your hits are solved well we can say we are done with this project.",
            "So the concepts here we have requester is the person that creates the project.",

            "So in our heat we have some part of the templates or sorry of the interface that will stay the same.",
            "Through each hit, this is what we call a template, and in the template we can have variables like programming languages that they will take different instances of or different values, and we're going to provide this value with some input data.",
            "So if we have no variables in one of our projects that mean we only have one instance of the project and the project is composed of mainly one hit.",
            "But usually we want to create many hits because we have small parts of a bigger problem that we want to solve.",

            "Only one, but this is not recommended because if that person was found where we are not going to know that in advance.",
            "So the best way is to assign or to create as many assignments as possible and this will depend of course on your task on your budget.",
            "And finally, each of these hits may have questions, so you can take a look at these hits.",
            "Or you may think of them as questionnaires and you can ask actually only one question.",

            "Or in a single hit.",
            "And in this case I will end up with 300 hits, so the cost of my project will be reduced compared to the original configuration that I had.",
            "Is this good?",
            "Will yes, but The thing is that you cannot ask for too many images in a single hit, because then the task could be very complex or very long.",
            "And then nobody would like to solve your task.",
            "So if you put more questions into a single hit, you usually have to consider that the reward of your heat should be increased and this is something that you need to sometimes play around.",

            "My recommendation would be.",
            "Usually go to Mechanical Turk.",
            "Take a look at the hits that are available out there and see how much they pay for the amount of work that you have to do and in this way you can somehow try to estimate what you should pay for your own crowdsourcing tasks."

            "So well, just too.",
            "Wrap up the workflow for the requesters so you have to create your project and you have to design it in a way that you actually get the workers to solve your hits an in the particular case of Mechanical Turk, there is the sandbox platform, which is exactly the same platform as Mechanical Turk, but for tests so you don't have actual workers in there.",
            "But it's like the technology behind this platform is exactly the same, so it's a very good practice to always goes to the sandbox first.",
            "Test at your heats are working as you want to so that the interface is working that you're getting the desired outputs, and so on.",
            "And once you're happy with that, you can actually go to the production site and publish your hits.",
            "There will be some some workers that will solve your hits hopefully, and then you will get the results from the crowd.",
            "You will review these results, you approve them or reject them, and in case of rejection you can.",
            "Republish those hits to actually get somebody to answer those questions.",
            "And once you have finished with all your hits well, you can say my project is completed.",
            "So everything that I described here is happening in the production side while the sandbox is only for for testing.",
            "How do I do the review of them?",
            "I'm going to talk about it later, but just to give you some insights, you get the you can do the review online.",
            "So in the web interface there is some checkbox where you can say, approve, reject, approve, reject and then you send all your reviews or you can download the results and somehow mark them as well as accept or reject validation of what worker does.",
            "It is it is, it is.",
            "We are always manually you.",
            "That depends on you.",
            "So you could create some mechanisms to try to detect a spam and try to do it automatically or semi automatically.",
            "But you can also go through each of the results, but if you are crowdsourcing for instance 20,000 triples as I did last time going through each of the results might not be possible.",
            "So what I did is I usually try to take a look at some parameters that indicate spam.",
            "So for instance, if the worker spent too little time on the task 2 seconds.",
            "That spam, because it's not possible that somebody spent such a short amount of time on a task, but spammers are getting more and more smart and then you they now they don't submit their tasks immediately, so they wait a little bit to treat this kind of mechanisms.",
            "But you can also use some gold standard questions, so when you have your certain as a requester of the right answers of this questions, you can just, you know, put them in your tasks and then use them as a mechanism to verify if they're doing.",
            "To work properly or not, there is no technique yet.",
            "I mean like in information retrieval they have pulling kind of thing.",
            "You know, I know it was a noted the documents and then submit it to some search engine and then take from 3 three different search engine they picked up under like this.",
            "No there is nothing like yeah well with Mechanical Turk everything is very low level so user requester has to do a lot of things and this is actually a good thing if you are working on.",
            "On research and trying to test your quality mechanisms or your spam depiction techniques with mechanical Turks.",
            "But there are also other platforms like Crowdflower that they actually have some quality control mechanisms, and the platform already preprocessed the data before giving it to you as a requester, and they kind of say I can assure you that these workers did a good job.",
            "So Crowd Flower is a little bit more, offers more support in that sense, that Mechanical Turk, but.",
            "Going to have less control because they're not transparent about it.",
            "Yeah, you actually don't know how.",
            "Say something you really would want to tweak those parameters yourself, especially we as researchers.",
            "I need to do this for work for more than one experiment.",
            "If you use this on a daily basis, you want to have some control.",
            "So which in the end was mechanical service?",
            "You get your CSV file and then you can do it is his default.",
            "Whatever you want, you can apply machine learning.",
            "You could try to learn a model for two identify spammers.",
            "You could try to learn how good the user isn't.",
            "Predict how well it will.",
            "It will reply at the next question whatever you want on that data, and then at the end you'll just have to create another CSV with the right entry in the column approved or reject and load it to the platform.",
            "There was a question over that question.",
            "How does the platform this with the merging of the answers from many workers for one single hit the platform does not handle that.",
            "You are the responsible one to merge.",
            "This results in a way that makes sense to you so.",
            "They show it like this.",
            "I mean that image was taken from one of the Mechanical Turk web pages, but actually you as a requester has to know how to merge those individual results for a single hit.",
            "So what I usually do is, well, I will take majority voting, so I will believe what the most of the people say.",

            "Then when you have some some some variability or when you know people do service on this.",

            "Because a few years ago paying 1 cent Azalina said was perfectly fine.",
            "Now if you pay 1 cent, even if it's a very very simple task, they will complain and they will talk bad about you or something.",
            "Also, requests are in their own forums, so the best thing is to take a look at the market and see how the others are doing it OK and now the next property is the number of assignments or the number of different persons are going to say solve the same task and again OK this depends how much on the redundancy that you want and consider that the higher number of assignments they hire, total cost of your project will be.",
            "So try to set up a number that it's reasonable, so I usually use 5 to 7 because that is with that number of redundancy that redundancy for me it's more than enough.",
            "I can.",
            "I can be sure that the answers that I'm getting are OK, but for other purposes or other applications like service, maybe you have to set up 20 or 30 assigned different assignments so these depend on your scenario.",
            "And again on the complexity of the task and so on.",
            "So the recommendation is always tried to submit a subset of your tasks, test them before you know submitting the 30,000 hits in your platform, and then see how is the responsiveness or the feedback from the users regarding your task and the redundancy that you set up.",
            "You can also configure the time that the workers have to solve your task, and again this is something that you have to be careful because if it's too short then the workers are under pressure to finish the task quickly before it times out.",
            "But if you are very lax and say well you have up to three hours to solve my task, they will think that the actual tasks takes 3 hours and then if you're paying 4 cents for a 3 hour task.",
            "This will look very bad when you when they are searching for your hips, so you have to play around.",
            "Be flexible, but also try to keep it a little bit realistic.",
            "And also we can set up the time when the heat expires in the in the website.",
            "So this is the time that the heat will be available on the platform and also the the time.",
            "Well if you as a request are to not approve or reject the tasks, then the platform will do it automatically for you.",
            "And of course they will accept everything and you will have to pay for it.",
            "So the idea is always that you will try not to.",
            "Reach this amount of time, just try to handle or response to your tasks as soon as they arrive.",
            "Another important thing in Mechanical Turk and it doesn't look that important because it's just down here and very small.",
            "Is this advanced links and this advanced links is very very important because there is where you can configure or set up your quality mechanisms where you can actually decide what type of crowd you want to solve your tasks.",

            "Are actually proved to be very good workers and the platform have.",
