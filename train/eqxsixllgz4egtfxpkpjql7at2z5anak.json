TNYT that.",
            "Originally originate in the brain, but there are best modeled as a kind of latent variable process where the actual neural activity that we're interested in and that actually interacts passes through a couple of processes, one of those being the hemodynamics, which I'll explain in the next slide, the other being the MRI scanner, which adds lots of its its own noise, and particularly through the signal before we have access to modeling in it.",
