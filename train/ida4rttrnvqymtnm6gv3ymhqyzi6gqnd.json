            "At different emission angles and you end up getting very nice diffraction patterns, because these modulations depend on the environment around emitting Atom.",

            "These are Palladium clusters.",
            "If you try to do some oxidation of CEO to produce CO2, you see that this activity of these guys is really related to the size to the number of atoms in the cluster an it's not something smooth.",

            "Same thing here.",

            "While these two molecules here are better form if I have a larger cluster.",
            "So this is actually a very nice example of what of the reactivity properties changing depending on the size of the cluster.",

            "So the source which is this guy here?",

            "So just to wrap it up.",
            "I've given you some hints of what you can do really with small clusters, very small clusters, an there is really a war to explore down there, and it's a lot of properties that need to be completely understood because these objects are really, really delicate, but we have the tool for doing that and combining our cluster source together with the synchrotron.",
