            "We have the entities.",
            "They're constantly being checked to make sure that we're we're detecting the correct entities that we have high precision that we have high recall across all of the different metrics that we have.",

            "And yeah I have a question about related to that when as you are aggregating a lot of data from several source I guess and.",
            "How is not about the quality, but how the client treats the provenance of your data.",
            "Does it care about where you are getting this data?",
            "And how is the consequence of bad date on that decision?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So about data quality.",
            "We have many premium providers of data in our system.",
            "The premium providers tend to give more curated information, so it's been verified already.",
            "It's from a reputable source, so you know we provide our clients type of source ranking, credibility, ranking and they're able to tell you which ones they should trust in which ones they shouldn't.",
            "So another difference as well is that the premium providers get alot of send us information in real time, so we have it within milliseconds and we process it within milliseconds.",
            "And it's to our clients in milliseconds.",
            "If we're getting anything, let's say from a content aggregator, somebody that's scraping from the web, or just from a local provider that takes them too long to turn around this information, then you also have this gap between when information should actually be in the public sphere when it actually made it out into the public sphere, and that can also lower.",
            "Let's say the ranking of a particular source.",
            "So we provide indicators as to which each sources.",
            "Who they are, who their websites are, and what the rank what our rank is for that.",
            "Me again, Kevin.",
            "So I wanted to ask you how much of the processing that you perform in your company is manually requires manual curation and.",
            "Or even what kind of processing requires some on intervention and how much of this manual curation you think can be automated in the future.",
            "You you think should be automated.",
            "Yeah, so.",
            "The first I'll talk about what is automated in our system.",
            "Everything that happens in real time is automated.",
            "Everything that we do in real time is stored, and if we ever change our system, we produce a new version of our product that Backfills history.",
            "Let's say with new insight what is done manually.",
            "So for instance, we tend not to trust external sources totally when they give us information, so everything has to be reviewed, let's say bye.",

            "The events on our system training our system and building, let's say the templates that are used to detect events and the roles entity plays.",
            "Also right now is a is a manual process.",
            "What could be automated in the future?",
            "For instance, feedback from our own system.",
            "A company just went through a merger with another or a company was acquired, could be automatically added to our system or or that we just include let's say information from third party providers automatically.",
            "I don't like that so much because there's a lot of errors in that.",
            "Often.",
            "And also the idea of auto training our systems so we have a data set of, you know, lots and lots of text that we have classified.",
            "We know the categories you know and it would be quite easy to use a machine learning process to automatically generate a lot of this as well.",

            "Very well recognized.",
            "Especially given how large you are compared to your competitors a few years ago there was a fantastic research paper based on your data out of Chicago.",

            "And what it was showing was that.",

            "And it has an impact on financial markets.",
            "The second thing that it showed was that the introduction of a new version of your sentiment analysis systematically changed the distribution of returns for certain equity classes, right?",
            "This is problematic in some sense, and I'm wondering, and it's a problem that all data providers have in to 1 degree or another.",
            "Perhaps for you it's maybe slightly larger problem.",
            "Slightly larger effect, how do you deal with this and how do your clients?",
            "How did your parents react?",
            "Maybe just a little bit of background on that between each version, so that's a good question.",

            "How do we make it so there's no impact on our clients?",
            "I think that's that's the question, right?",
            "So how do we deal with our first of all?",
            "Why does it change in between each version of our product?",
            "As I said, we come up with something new.",
            "We employ new technology.",
            "There's bug fixes, there's improvements to detection.",
            "Do as we re classify all of history and that's something that you know could really affect clients in a bad way.",
            "What changes?",
            "Well, normally around 10% of the data changes.",
            "It can shift around.",
            "There's different reasons for that.",
            "We add new entities that are back fields so you know maybe a client says we would like Asian companies added more Asian companies so we improve our coverage there.",
            "That can change things for a client because perhaps they traded on a particular universe and we've just added a lot more components from that universe, so that could change their own trading style.",
            "Or we may do something like Imagine if we had an event called IPO and then we discover a. IPO is actually a lot more granular.",
            "You've got IPO rumors.",
            "You've got IPO investigations.",
            "You've got IPO pricing.",
            "All of these different states within the IPO group.",
            "So we make it more granular and that means that the IPO event itself starts to lose its liquidity and we distribute that across more granular events.",
            "OK, that can change the way our clients would trade on that data.",
            "So how do we prevent that causing them any problems?",
            "By versioning our product?",
            "So whenever we come out with the new data with the new data product, it gets its own version.",
            "There's a set of historical flat files for that new version.",
            "There's a set of real time processes set up for that new version, and it works in parallel.",
            "To all of the previous versions, we're still producing data set that we came out with in 2008 today because it's part of a black box, trading technique or trading model that one of our clients has an we can't turn it off, so we will always continue to produce that old data even though it's worse, but they don't want us changing it.",
