            "So I very much agree with the gentleman who spoke from LexisNexis and encourage people in this room who have the brains trust to be able to be part of the solution to help do the data modeling and help set that in many cases structured data that the government is uniquely positioned to be able to collect.",
            "And we as taxpayers in this country have paid and in your respective countries have paid millions and in many cases billions of dollars to collect.",
            "So that technology is available.",
            "We have an unprecedented window of opportunity in this country.",
            "You're telling me to be short, Jim?",
            "An unprecedented opportunity with the Federal CIO and CTO who are using the words machine readable in human readable data and releasing that data on the web.",
            "So I'd like to just encourage anybody who's interested to look into the government linked data working Group, which is an international working group.",
            "We meet weekly and these people are really doing an awful lot to help realize much of what Gene has described today.",
            "Thanks for all the work that you and George are doing on that group, Bernadette.",
            "So there are a number of federal agencies that supply a lot of money for research and development, so two of the big ones being National Science Foundation and NIH.",
            "They publish, including on data.gov.",
            "Allegedly success rates for research proposals in different categories, but they only publish this data in very coarse categories.",
            "At NSF, for example, they do it by division divisions, about 100 and $50,000,000 a year.",
            "In NIH, they publish it by Institute.",
            "Some of those institutes are 5 billion dollars a year.",
            "They have a number of different.",
            "So, for example.",
            "In computer science, they publish it by division, but a division has several major solicitations each year in different size categories, and the detailed end.",
            "And researchers apply to particular solicitations in a particular size category they would like to know what the success rates for these things are historically, but none of this data is being released, and in fact, I know from personal experience that program officers that attempt to release this data are censured.",
            "So the question is, is David Gov.",
            "Or the White House or anybody going to do anything about this?",
            "Yes.",
            "So I hadn't thought about the success rate specifically, but the idea of funding and grants and Sciences and how we are awarding that and what are the results of that research are two of the primary initiatives under our new research community.",
            "So I mentioned earlier that President Obama had said there were six national priorities he wanted to do.",
            "We did the first 5, the last one.",
            "We've done, a portion of it.",
            "So if you go to data, if you go to manufacturing.",
            "Data.gov, you'll see sort of the end of the research line information, but research data.gov will be coming out momentarily.",
            "We built it in the back end.",
            "We're just wrestling with one issue, which I think is close to what you're saying, which is trying to connect all of the published research that happens.",
            "Whether it's at your universities at at FTC, an agency at a contract organization, published that in a way that connects people to.",
            "Technologies that may be useful to them so that technology may be something that was just an idea.",
            "It could be something that was tested in the lab is something maybe that was actually implemented on a Navy ship for example, but could be used more effectively on manufacturing or in business or in some other kind of private enterprise technology.",
            "In almost every case the government doesn't charge for that or license it, even in anyway, although credit is always appreciated, so we are in the midst of making that connection across many, many agencies like NASA and DARPA and Noah and ODS.",
            "An NSF scientists funding but hadn't thought about the actual success rate of the thing.",
            "So if we could talk more later, I will make sure that that's part of what we do.",
            "Hi, I'm Abbie Bernstein from the University of Zurich.",
            "I think it's great that data gets freed up and gets put in the hands of people that can do stuff with it.",
            "I'm kind of asking a complementary question.",
            "What are we doing to teach people to understand what it means to handle data?",
            "Because data comes with its own problems with its own distributions, especially with its own quality issues.",
            "And one of the biggest concerns I've seen when talking to people is, but they will draw conclusions that are.",
            "Let's put it that way that are not necessarily desirable because they misinterpret some of the data.",
            "What are we doing?",
            "Not in order to just free up the data, but actually enable people to understand what the data means.",
            "Great question.",
            "So again, I.",
            "Don't have any opinion about how people put the data to use.",
            "I think it's inappropriate for the government to step into the role of sort of critiquing.",
            "Like if someone does a visualization comparing the number of space shuttle launches to the number of dog licenses registered in the state of Florida, it's obviously a nonsense data set.",
            "But you know, correlation and causation are not necessarily interconnected.",
            "So what we do is we provide a couple of different ways for one Education 2.",
            "Kind of kick start and help the generational learning and the second one is for the crowd to sort of vet itself.",
            "So on data.gov, you can share back a visualization interpretation of a data set directly on the data set, so when you go to download the data set, you can actually see you know.",
            "Five people have also shared Maps of this visualization Maps an you can comment on those and tell them that they sucker that they're great and we think it's much better to let the public do that.",
            "The second thing is I mentioned our learn site.",
            "Mentioned it briefly about all the universities that we highlight that are using data.gov and open data in the classroom to kind of teacher or college aged groups.",
            "How to use that data.",
            "How to make sense of it?",
            "I mean, it's not just about developers and like teaching them the code for it, but it's also like what would make sense to mashup.",
            "And I know Jim and I have had long conversations about this and I was at Temple the other day talking to them about it.",
            "You know, part of the context is what makes sense.",
            "We are also working with K through 12 educators, so that's our kindergarten through 12th grade.",
            "Because we realize is the people who get data are already like going to the universities and going into MSN.",
            "It programs what we want to do is catch kids early on so we have looked at everything from partnerships with Sesame Street too.",
            "What better guy for an open data advocates that the account volume to 3 right?",
            "And then looking at issues related to so?",
            "I work closely with the National International Science Fair, so if any of you guys have had kids go through middle school in the States and it works in 40 two different countries like you know the kids make volcanoes and you help them go to the science fair and the volcano erupts and stuff.",
            "OK so we are part and parcel of the information infrastructure for the National Science Fair.",
            "In the International Science Fair, so when kids get the resources early on of what they can use, data.gov is there so that it can help inform.",
            "We get a lot of kids using like the food pyramid and some of our health health apps and I go and talk to that group every year as they work through their process.",
            "So we try to try to reach but I think is a big thing is reaching to that education community to help people understand as they go through the education process.",
            "So that we graduate smarter citizens.",
            "So there is 1.",
            "One very often asked question on the Twitter stream at the moment is where can people get the five start mug but not sure you're the right person to ask.",
            "CafePress that's right cafe.",
            "CafePress.",
            "There you go.",
            "You can all go CafePress and get your own five star Link data month.",
            "We're out of time and as much as I'd like to let it go for much longer, I think we're going to stop.",
