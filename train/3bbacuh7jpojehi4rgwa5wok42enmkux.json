            "So the boss says, you know, it can make a few errors, but not too many ones that will embarrass me.",
            "So if you roll out a new service in Silicon Valley that really performance badly, the people who are getting bad service, the ones who are going to complain right to the newspapers and bad stories will come out about you.",

            "In the Google case, you have to return your search results within 10s of milliseconds.",
            "If you around in the 90s, and Google came when it first came out, you would type anything into this little box and you hit the button within 10s of milliseconds.",

            "There's a huge systems thing that the whole system cannot run slower.",
            "Alright, so that starts to get to be a hard challenge.",
            "Moreover, we don't have principles at this point, because in statistics there is very little theory that says you want to control the runtime and you want to control the error rate and you have a certain amount of data.",
            "Give me a procedure equation that does that.",
            "We don't have that.",
            "OK, we need it now.",
            "It gets even more interesting when the computer science gets to be more about scalability.",

            "But of course in 10 years will have a petabyte of data, and surely this is and will only get better during that entire time.",
            "Because you'll have more detailed granular data about all the people that you're trying to serve.",
            "Surely the service could only get better, but remember, it can't slow down during that entire time.",
            "Alright now algorithms runs, but if I was running time that scales with the amount of data they run slower in log in and squared, and maybe a sub linear, but they get.",
            "So if you're not able to slow down and you're getting more and more data, and you're supposed to perform just as even better than before, and the same amount of time that science fiction we have no principles on how to do that now we believe you can do it.",
            "Alright, 'cause you can start to do parallel distributed architectures, you can start to maybe subsample data in smart ways, but now we're in the realm of there's no engineering principles, so I'd like to think about this is as.",
            "Malaga to civil engineering, you know for thousands of years people built bridges and buildings.",

            "These systems are going to be rolled out in domains like personal medical decision making.",
            "Where they need to make a decisions within maybe hours or days.",
            "So there is a temporal budget and they're going to make lots of uncontrolled false positives, and people will make decisions and have operations, and people will die.",
