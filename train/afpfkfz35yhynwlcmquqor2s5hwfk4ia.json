            "So yeah, I was in Jim Hendler's lab in Maryland in like early days of the semantic Web, and when I got invited to give the keynote house, like you know, I'm not doing like tons of semantic Web stuff at this point.",
            "My work there had very much influences.",
            "What I do now.",
            "But I'm not writing a lot of RDF these days, which was very much my life as a grad student, but it's interesting like I started.",
            "I was told that was OK, and hopefully you'll see I've got a lot of suggestions for ways that we can kind of bring together these issues that I really care about these days.",
            "I think the semantic Web has a great opportunity to help with those, but I also started going back through some of the stuff that I had done, and I thought maybe I would just start with a little bit of that context setting.",
            "'cause like, I don't think of myself as old.",

            "Like go ahead and try that and it kind of worked out for me pretty well.",
            "That's a thing that's happened and but there was not much at that point where any of you like doing.",

            "What do you think the biggest one was in 2005?",
            "Isn't that when I started 2005?",
            "Guess is so my space is the normal guess, Myspace was second on the list.",

            "You know, we weren't even really calling it social media then, but social networks and how people can trust one another and so basically the solution that I had, is that I was going to have to build a social network because like there was no API like you couldn't use data from any of these social networks.",
            "And so I built a couple.",
            "I built one that I think I called trust net.",
            "I couldn't even find anything about it, but it was just basically you sign up and you could list your friends and then you could rate how much you trust them.",
            "This is what you did on social networks back in the days that the 10 Myspace users in the room know this.",
            "But even like.",
            "Early Facebook users.",
            "There was no such thing as a status update.",
            "You couldn't post pictures like what you did is maintain a profile.",
            "You put a picture of yourself up there and then there was kind of a form you'd fill in with, like your name and where you went to school and your hobbies and list your friends and that was it.",
            "And that was a huge thing because before that you had to basically be able to do HTML and have a web host an FTP and put your files online.",
            "If you wanted a profile and people would then somehow have to find it, which was very much not good then.",
            "So having one place where anyone could make a profile was a big deal in what you did on social media was spend a lot of time working on your profile page and then looking at your friend's profile pages and we would list stuff about people.",
            "So Myspace had like you could list your top friends if you got mad at somebody to kick him off your top list of friends.",
            "So it seemed like a thing people would do is rate how much they trust their friends.",
            "It turns out this was not a thing that we do but it was a thing that people were willing to do that.",
            "And so I made this first network trust net.",
            "And you know, kind of bullied a bunch of people I knew into joining and I was out putting a representation of that network in RDF using FOAF.",
            "I was a big fan of folks.",
            "We had some folk workshops that I thought it was great and so there was a little RDF file for every user that had their profile information.",
            "All their friends and then I had augmented the FOAF ontology with the trust ontology and it had just like a one to 10 rating.",
            "I think how much you trust people.",
            "This seems like a reasonable idea, but what I did was get a bunch of my grad student friends and then also bunch faculty members at Maryland.",
            "They were all people who joined this.",
            "And the guy in the office next to me started looking at the RDF an.",
            "He's like my advisor gave me a 3 out of 10.",
            "That was all public right?",
            "You'd rated how much he trusted people and they put out the RDF.",
            "He was super upset about this and I was like oh I have just made this huge mistake right?",
            "I've taken this potentially really sensitive information and even though I said it's going to be out there on the public web, I don't think his advisor knew that he'd be able to see that three and people got really upset in it.",
            "It started me thinking about this idea of privacy and like how do we work with that on the semantic web?",
            "How do we have this data that we can interchange that everybody can access?",
            "We went on to later build another network called Film Trust which was like movie Recommendation system.",
            "We could rate how much you trusted people.",
            "That was a little bit less sensitive 'cause you don't get super offended if someone doesn't trust your taste in movies.",
            "Hopefully and part of the reason for that domain choice was this idea that like I want to be.",
            "Doing some semantic web stuff with this, I want to be sharing this, but there's maybe some issues that come with that.",
            "So let's pick something like movies that aren't super sensitive at the same time.",
            "So kind of back in 2005 there was this website that came out called Plink, which I think stood for people link it was.",
            "I don't even know who made it, but it was some semantic web aficionado and they said we're going to find all the folks we can find online.",
            "Basically all this RDF about people and we're just going to aggregate it together and then we'll make a profile page for everybody.",
            "It's like a social network, but you don't have to make your own page.",
            "We're just going to take data about you from other places, and that's sort of OK. 'cause like how many people had FOAF data about them out there, it was like the Semantic Web grad students basically, right?",
            "Like making ourselves some folk, except there was some semantic web person who got to work on.",
            "I don't know if it was Obama's but somebody's election campaign in the 2004 election cycle, and so back then.",
            "And still sort of they would have this thing where it's like, hey, if you're interested in so and so's campaign, invite your friends to the website so you put in your address so they could send an email from you and you put in your friend's address and it would send a message to your friend from you that says hey come check out so and so's campaign page.",
            "And for every person who did that they made a little photo file that said these two people are friends with their email addresses in it.",
            "Link sucked that up 'cause it was all just out there on the web and so suddenly 10s of thousands of people who didn't know anything about the semantic web were finding themselves and their friends.",
            "Profile now on this site that ultimately got shut down because of that backlash and so we have a couple of these instances that actually sound like sort of modern privacy issues on social media coming out before Facebook even existed in these really early days where we were trying to think about exchanging this data and it was interesting to me to think about how that kind of set the context for these challenges that we faced over and over going forward.",
            "We then did a study a few years later where we looked at.",
            "Both that you could get so live Journal output.",
            "Both live Journal was a very popular blogging platform like back at the in the aughts.",

            "A few other social networks did we kind of sucked that all up and we found that we could merge profiles for about 5% of people.",
            "So out of everyone that was there.",
            "But 5% of people had multiple profiles that they had not explicitly LinkedIn.",

            "So I may not be able to freak you out as much as my normal audiences, but I do want to at least give you a taste of how freaked out a lot of people are about this stuff and where I think there's a real space for new research in making the world better for the average user.",

            "What was his line?",
            "Consent is stupid, like just get over it.",

            "If you say that about consent, it sounds bad, and so I like to use this as a device when I end up in these debates with people to say we can kind of agree that this is what privacy is.",
            "It's this consent element over our information.",
