            "Or you can do very effective plarre P or the rest of it.",
            "But many countries have small specialized institutions with 500 students that they can't handle this, not in any meaningful meaningful way.",

            "You're quite right.",

            "If there's a lot of credits in the portfolio and a student pays 5 or $600 and gets 20 credits, then it's cost effective for that student.",
            "So in some ways it could be if they build up their portfolio and I do believe that automated testing.",
            "Should bring the price of testing and accreditation down considerably if we adopt more of it.",
            "And I believe that it can be cost effective.",
            "It can be quality assessment and in fact I believe it can be even better assessment than human corrected assessments.",

            "We need to find scalable systems and we need to look around and try different ways of doing that.",

            "And at least now people are beginning to get it.",
