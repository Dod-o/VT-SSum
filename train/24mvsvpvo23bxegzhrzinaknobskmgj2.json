            "So once when you get this number of tweets per day, then you actually look at is this a real event or not?",

        [
            "This components of this approach here is the schematic architecture.",

            "Then you know you put your event categories, which are essentially your queries which define how quads are you interested in.",
            "You put that into the Knowledge Graph which combines this quotes with DBPR in Word net.",

            "Essentially, you arise and so on.",
            "So already a good first step, but the problem is not just to now resolve this, I mean it turned out that this output of open IE wasn't very clean, in particular.",
            "For example, we wanted to identify location of various actions and for this you also get the parse tree out of this tool and then you can do some kind of pattern matching on the parse tree.",
            "I'm not going to go into the details, but essentially if you see a specific pattern grammatical pattern essentially in the sentence.",
            "Then you can say OK, this object is not actually the object of the action, but the location of the action.",
            "It's like an adverb essentially, so you can move this into the location part of the quad.",
            "Then another thing which was actually quite difficult is that this tool wasn't very good at identifying passive voice.",
            "So again some kind of grammatical pattern matching on this parse tree here and then you can actually flip around the object and the subject and hopefully correct the passive voice.",
            "In the sentence.",
