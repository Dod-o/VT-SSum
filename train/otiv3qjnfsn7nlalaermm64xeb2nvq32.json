            "I think of this as a perfect storm, the right time to do these things, and the four things is one starts with theories, and by this I'm really talking about social science theories in the social Sciences, we have a terrific understanding now.",

            "A solid understanding of why we create, maintain, dissolve the kinds of network links we do, and so there is an understanding of the generative mechanisms.",

            "Because of Web 2.0 generally.",
            "We have vast amounts of digital traces that we never had previously.",
            "The third is we also don't have methods that have been developed in the field of network science that go beyond just descriptive methods are saying this is the degree distribution or this is the density.",

            "Why links need to happen, why they should happen, etc.",

            "You can have all the data you want.",
            "You can have all the methods you want.",
            "But if you don't have the computational infrastructure to run these, you're again at a loss.",

            "But in order to do any serious analysis with that, you need the kind of petascale computing infrastructure to be able to analyze these networks.",
