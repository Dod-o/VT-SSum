            "However, there is an interesting observation here is that.",
            "This contains the scores themselves, so if you have things that run up at the top and on the vertical, basically it tells you that you have good classification with scores that are very close to zero and one right.",
            "So if you're trying to use that kind of model as a probability estimate, right, not nearly a good idea because the scores are not smooth.",
            "They're very what's called refined.",
            "Right there, there's very separated, so smoothness has something to do with the actually convexity.",
            "The smoothness of this curve, which could show up on the arosi, but it's not at the same resolution because you don't have the actual magnitude.",
            "Everything is sitting here in the graph and it sold within the unit square space.",
            "So yes, you can do this kind of analysis to test.",
            "Movie that is so bad that I'm running suggesting.",
            "So you have a movie that is so bad that everyone is suggesting you to watch it, but they're all given you're giving very bad scores to that movie, but everyone is suggesting you to watch it.",
            "So how do your method behaves?",
            "So you're trying to say that I have a data point that has that is a positive, right?",
            "But it has a really low score.",
            "Now it's back to the midpoint if it actually falls above the midpoint, I'm OK.",
            "But if it falls below the midpoint, it will get the inverse.",
            "It will actually show, as in you should not touch this thing because whoever gave it the score got it wrong.",
            "Now you can appreciate here is that there is a small trick to it is that the labels are good.",
            "I just compared the score to the label.",
            "I find somehow a midpoint and I believe the label.",
            "So if I have a score that is somehow fishy right then I'll trust the labels slightly more.",
            "But that could be adjusted.",
            "That is not necessarily.",
            "Yes.",
            "Did I understand you correctly that if you have?",
            "Curve that gives.",
            "Optimal scores to all classes and very low scores to all minus is it has a higher area under the curve then a curve that sorts them correctly, but sort of gives.",
            "Values interpolates the values somehow.",
            "Yes, the question then is so usually if you do recommendations or something you will not have this extreme cases that get the maximum area.",
            "What is the interpretation of the area under the curve then?",
            "Is it something that I mean that has some semantics to it, like in like in the regular Roc curves?",
            "There is a major difference between the two you see in the Roc curve.",
            "So here I'll give you something to illustrate what I'm trying to get up.",
            "If you have a set of only positive recommendations right, you can't plug in arosi because you need at least one negative to be able to see the separation between the two, and that's the intuitive Inter interpretation related to the AUC.",
            "Is that it shows you how the negatives and positives are separated in the smooth arosi there's actually an extra bit into it is that I'm looking at the separation between the positive and the negative scores in the context of the labels.",
            "So what happens here is that if if I have only positive examples, so let's say only the top two points, I can still plot a smooth arosi because I have the score that also contained some sort of a.",
            "As long as the scores are not ones right?",
            "Because if they are ones, then there's nothing to plot there.",
            "But because I have this component of this cord that is still not quite positive, then I could actually have line segments that have a slope and that way I can compare data points within the same class because within a given class let's say the class of positives you have those that are appropriately scored and inappropriately scored.",
            "So here.",
            "The area under the curve is related to how well the scoring.",
            "Is or how appropriate the scores are to the labels?",
            "How they are separated?",
            "The positive and the negative scores, which is slightly different than than it is in the regular arosi because they you see here separates the negatives to positives.",
            "Regardless of what their scores are.",
            "Here we're actually looking at the nature of the value of this score.",
            "Does that make any sense?",
