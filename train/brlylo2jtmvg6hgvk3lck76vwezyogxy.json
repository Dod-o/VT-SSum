            "So you know our graph QM is realized by subsets and so the image of every vertex of gamma is a subset of a mega OK, and so we can if you have an edge XY, we can assign it a label L of XY, which is simply the symmetric difference between the images.",
            "Of X and you know the image of why?",

            "Well, first of all, if you know labels, we basically know the embedding.",

            "And you put them together.",

            "If you put together all the labels, then the result is in fact the symmetric difference of the images of X&Y is the end vertice is, so if you know if you know if you have X and you know the labels, you can immediately find fee of YY any pass at all from X to Y. OK.",

            "Probably not so easy to read, but in terms of pictures it's pretty simple.",

            "No coordinate repeats.",
