            "Basically the current strategy was to take one sentence, but since I think Stanford parser can also work on the whole paragraph, we could also take the whole paragraph.",
            "So the basic idea would be to use to have the dependencies and it depends on dependencies.",

            "Yes, so basically.",
            "We use it so we extract these verbs and usually like through the space there is like usually one verb which is like strikes in this sentence because it's like a path rest if it's not in the past in the correct path between these dependencies, then it's not.",
            "You do not get it OK, because we're using dependency parser, you rely on the parser.",
            "Yes, I rely on the parser idealizing this.",
            "Let's say yes.",
            "Or special interdependence?",
            "Yeah, so basically you have like a subject predicate object, but in a different form in general semi automatic because at the end you still want the user which is good, so you should verify yes how well you are doing because it is how many user confirm and how many people or whatever.",
            "You can also filter.",
            "Then we can also filter.",
            "This works exactly like very few amount of relationships and we don't use it.",
            "Or if there are like more than we use it or that's awesome.",

            "Wondering how many parameters do you need to tune to get it right?",

            "You can tell you I can assure you so it's basically what we need, like a list of initial inputs.",
            "But we can also do without.",
            "I mean so yes we need the list of initial inputs.",
            "Let's stick to it and then we can bootstrap.",
            "Like get more concepts and we can get relationship so it's.",
            "So you get more concepts from from Wikipedia also.",
            "We decided something is a valid concept.",
            "Basically how it was tested in computer science domain because fashion is a bit different.",
