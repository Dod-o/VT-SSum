            "Sort of a dab.",
            "Alright, so I'm going to dab and then I'm going to ring so it's all the space it's strong and a sustained at the end.",

            "Some people like direct space, it's just uncomfortable for them.",

            "You can't just do it, just do it.",

            "Because it brings up your core of what you're able to do, you know.",
            "So then when you get into the planes you basically this is the last thing I will say about the plane, so we're in the Casa Hedron.",
            "The thing that's interesting about the cost here in terms of the plane is that when you're in this space here, which is both vertical and horizontal.",
            "You fall out of it into the sagittal and what the reason why you do that is because Laban noticed how drunk people kind of walked down the street.",
            "So if you are kind of like drunk and you're kind of walking around, you're falling into the missing dimension.",
            "So if I'm here in the vertical, I'm going to fall into the saddle and then I'm going to come over here into the horizontal.",
