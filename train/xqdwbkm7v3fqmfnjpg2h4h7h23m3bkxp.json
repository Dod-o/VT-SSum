            "And two points to make here.",
            "One is that the distributions are a little bit bimodal, so you can see there's sort of a dip there for a bunch of those curves, and we'll come back to that with something we'll see throughout their results.",

            "There was a downward shift in the ratings when people were making judgments when the names were shown in the non anonymous condition, and in fact there are the means down there in the bottom.",
            "So for interesting this you see a drop from a 3.72 rating to a 3.44 rating simply by virtue of the name being shown.",
            "OK, and it's not a tremendous difference in terms of absolute magnitude, but it was statistically significant.",

            "People's judgments about the content and the author actually lower on average.",
            "OK.",
            "So, but that was an average and so to dive into this a little bit further.",
            "The first thing we did is we clustered users using K means clustering with KL divergences are distance metric into three categories.",

            "Here's what their curves look like.",
            "So again, interesting this on the left, an authority on the right, and these were just the just the anonymous ratings, not the not the ones.",
            "When the names were shown.",
            "And so the bad authors were the blue line there, and they're clearly shifted lower.",
            "The ratings of the bad authors are clearly lower.",
            "Now the average authors in the red dashed line and the good authors on the green line are actually pretty similar when they're anonymous, and it turns out.",
            "Looking at the bottom there, it turns out that the good authors actually get a higher rating when you show their name, and that's the bottom line there.",
            "So their ratings actually jump a little bit anyway when you show their name.",
            "The average authors actually, the bad authors were hurt the most, so their ratings actually drop a ton when you show their name and then the average authors, through the ones that are really getting the short end of the stick.",
            "Because even though they're posting content that when Anonymous is very similar to these good authors, when you reveal their name, they actually go down.",
            "So the overall difference between these sort of average authors and the good authors is this shift in opposite directions.",
            "And that was a significant difference, by the way."
        ],
        [
            "OK.",
            "So coming to this issue of name value so one proxy for name value is follower count.",
            "People with large follower counts have probably spent the time to basically make a name for themselves.",
            "You know when you get to hundreds of thousands of followers, people basically know who you are.",
            "So we looked at this relationship between number of followers, which is X axis here and the average rating Y axis and the red line is a regression line or linear fit line.",
            "OK, a couple of things to note here.",
            "Oh and so the one on the left is when they're anonymous and the one on the right is when the names were shown.",
            "So a couple of points.",
            "First off, they are.",
            "Squares aren't huge, but what you can see is that as you shift to the right side where the names are shown, the results kind of tighten up and you can see it in the graph are in the figures, and in fact the R-squared jumped from .168 Point 2 one which again is not huge, but the relative improvement is actually pretty pretty substantial.",
            "The other thing maybe, in my opinion, the most interesting thing is look at this group on the far right of each graph so the group with the most number of followers.",
            "So on the left when they're anonymous, they're actually below this sort of expectation line.",
            "So based on number of followers they should be at the line, but most of them are actually below the line.",
            "Are getting lower ratings than you would expect given the number of followers.",
            "But then when you jump to the right and you show their name, suddenly they're getting higher ratings.",
            "Then you would expect, given the number of followers.",
            "So basically they're going from roughly a 3 1/2 average rating to a four and a half to five average rating simply by virtue of their name being shown.",
            "OK, so and then the third thing was that a little bit harder to tell, but there's sort of a middle group there who showed the opposite affect.",
            "Same thing as we saw before, which is there actually?",
            "Saying so, that's in this sort of log 8 to 10 range.",
            "They're actually posting content that's rated as higher than the people with lots of followers, except when the name is shown.",
            "Suddenly it's rated lower."
        ],
        [
            "So the next thing we wanted to look at was OK, so people are biased.",
            "Well, how much are they bias, right?",
            "And so we looked at the amount of bias per participant.",
            "OK, it turns out this is extremely bimodal, so almost everybody is biased.",
            "To some degree this is absolute amount of bias that could be positive or negative.",
            "Almost everybody is biased to some extent by about one point that is compared to how they rated when no name was shown.",
            "How do their ratings change when you show the name?",
            "And so almost everybody is biased by some amount, typically about one point.",
            "But then there's this group that's extremely biased, right?",
            "Like almost 4 plus on this seven Point rating scale.",
            "So there's a chunk of people out there.",
            "It's about 15% who are just like extremely driven by the name of the author of the content."
        ],
        [
            "OK. Now let's look at a few factors, that of the name themselves that might be driving this bias.",
            "So we then took all of our usernames, the stimuli usernames, and we coded them.",
            "And so the first one is gender, so we have female names, male names and then names, usernames.",
            "Twitter handles that.",
            "We weren't sure if they're male or female.",
            "And.",
            "Couple things to note here, so most top authors were gender neutral, so these especially with these high follower counts where authors like Time magazine or matchable and they tend to get the highest ratings.",
            "Oh and so the B again.",
            "So for female be that would be when the names were shown and female A would again being anonymous.",
            "Men are higher than women when anonymous, and that's statistically significant, but they drop more when their names are shown.",
            "But overall female authors tend to get lower ratings.",
            "Women do get a slight bump, however, when their names were shown, at least for the interesting Ness rating, but still were lower overall."
        ],
        [
            "OK, next next level rating we did was sort of the type of author.",
            "Are you an organization?",
            "Are you a person or we're not sure and it turns out that organizations actually are very consistent whether or not their names are shown.",
            "Basically and again, these were fairly high profile organizations, and basically what this is saying is they're pumping out relatively high quality content so it almost doesn't matter if there even if their names aren't showing, they're still getting a relatively high.",
            "High rating.",
            "For people though, and for those that we weren't sure about, both of those see significant drops in their evaluation of them in their content when their names were shown."
        ],
        [
            "And then the final type of their username, character characterization that we did was how topical was it.",
            "So for a lot of these things, like World Cup, there highly topical sounding usernames, and you would think, oh, that could make a difference.",
            "You know your World Cup 2010 or whatever you know people might just assume that you know more about the World Cup.",
            "And so we coded are you, were you not on topic?",

            "Being off topic actually hurts you, and that was significant.",

            "OK, so ahead of schedule takeaways.",

            "And so I may.",
            "I wonder why there was an effect when you see the name.",

            "Yeah, that was kind of that.",
            "Yeah, that was interesting to us too.",

            "I'm not sure what the explanation is there.",
            "I mean, it could be something in the language.",
            "We had our sample, our participant participant population was relatively gender balanced, but not perfectly so that could have had something to do with it.",

            "OK, my other one was a lot of trust and authority to me would seem like do I think that person or do I know that person is good at a topic and I imagine you've controlled for that one if you so I trust certain people have been very good with technology, but lots of people wouldn't recognize their names.",
            "Right, so yeah.",
            "So as I said in the in, this sort of outside the idea here was to take, yeah.",
            "So if it's people from your own feed, you probably recognize them and maybe you've sort of established overtime that there an expert idea here was to look at scenarios such as a search context where maybe you recognize him 'cause it's Time magazine, but for the most part it could be people that you don't know.",
            "So if you're looking for information on World Cup.",
            "You may not normally follow people about the World Cup.",
            "You search and you see a bunch of authors and you have to make a decision is what they're saying, valuable or trustworthy or interesting, etc.",
            "OK thanks.",
            "Hi film answer from Indiana University.",
            "Actually, maybe already it's a follow up on the previous question I was I was actually going to ask, how do you distinguish the effect of the name itself versus just the effect of recognizing somebody and just the effect of recognition?",
            "Of course would produce a bias like in the results where you know people are you know the.",
            "The paper on music that was where you either saw the ranking of other people or you didn't see the ranking.",
            "So the classic you know popularity bias.",
            "So I I was wondering if you can really sort of discern them and also comment on significance.",
            "You mentioned that the differences are very small but significant.",
            "So how you know how?",
            "How do you feel about that?",
            "The magnitude of the effect?",
            "Yeah, see.",
            "So to the first one, we didn't explicitly look at that.",
            "I mean, I think the best they can probably say about that is we looked at it a little bit with respect to.",
            "These so in the cases where.",
            "So you had some, so there are number of cases here.",
            "I don't think we had enough to make sort of a generalizable statement about it, but there were enough cases here where there were names that were sort of moderately on topic, but they were big and they were well known.",
            "So Time magazine was a good example to Time magazine is not an expert on the oil spill, but they're an expert on news in general, right?",
            "And so.",
            "Again, I don't think we had enough data points and say something generalizable, but that was our explanation for why you saw this, which is there are just known entities out there and you get this boost.",
            "So I agree 100% in terms of the magnitude.",
            "You know?",
            "I yeah, they weren't huge on a 7 point scale half a point.",
            "If you look at the difference between some people getting a boost and some people getting hurt, you're looking at.",
            "You know maybe a point or something like that, which you know it's 1515%.",
            "It was a bunch of sort of 20% some cases.",
            "That's kind of getting up there, especially when it was such a, in our opinion.",
            "Was such a sort of small manipulation mean the only thing you're doing is just showing their name or not showing the name?",
            "So it's actually pretty pretty subtle.",
            "In future work you can do things like manipulate the picture, or you could show ratings.",
            "You get all the all the things you might expect, right?",
            "So the idea here was sort of the lowest bar.",
            "What's the sort of smallest thing that's usually there with the content?",
            "That might make a difference.",
            "Hi my name is Samuel from Google.",
            "I have a quick question about clustering of authors.",
            "Presumably I guess I guess you did.",
            "Clustering of the authors for anonymous case and non anonymous case separately, right?",
            "Yes what I showed was just for anonymous I see.",
