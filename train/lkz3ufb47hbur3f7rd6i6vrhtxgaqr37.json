Is it a breaking event anticipated and then once you have decided that you want to find out which time point you are actually when you issue this query, at which time point you are right, and as we will see later on, there are quite some implications on how you actually solve this task, and but I'll explain that in a bit and then in the end you once you have kind of this, all information that you have decided, how do you actually rank these aspects such that you account for these two types of information?"
