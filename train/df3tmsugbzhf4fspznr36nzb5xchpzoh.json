            "So by the time the survey was compiled was which was roughly a mid 16 wiki data was not used for evaluation there.",

            "For example, if they use machine learning, they put it in some propositional form and then run standard approaches on them, and the proper propositionally station approaches are fairly basic and stuff like graph mining at that time was really rarely used.",
