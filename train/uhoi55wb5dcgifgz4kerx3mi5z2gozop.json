            "Image sets and you will construct some convex help for that image that yeah, by using the image is extracted from the video exactly.",

            "How to model the image set?",
            "But if you fail it failed.",
            "Yeah, in some cases image set may have linear topology, so that's why actually introduced this candle trick.",
