            "But for the state microscopy, if what is crucial that that's why you see here I have like 1 Asterix, and here are two Asterix, so you see that these detect from or our distinguished this spontaneous emission from this stimulated emission they need to go from like different different vibrational levels of this E. 0 that we can distinguish this.",
            "Distinguish this photons or or separate separate so and now with the with the state mikroskopie we will do will combine these two approaches and you can see it here.",

            "Tricky image, but The thing is that.",
            "There are these practical aspects of this.",
            "First is of course we are not doing this approach in the same place.",
            "Then also we are not doing this approach and the same place and 3rd is that we will do this one with the high with the high energy of these photons and I will now explain how to do it and why."

        [
            "So first I told you that it is important to have the different different wavelength, so that's why that's why to work this state optimally we need to apply this state wavelength, which is in the in this right side of the spectrum.",
            "So when compared to the peak.",
            "So we are taking this here.",
            "This part of the fluorescent Spectra so so we can be.",
            "We cannot be.",
            "Of course we can, but then then the state is not optimal.",
            "We can be too far for the.",
            "In regard to the peak of the florist and of the fluorophore we are using.",
            "Then why why we need higher high intensity of the state laser?",
            "Because you see that the probability of this of this stimulated depletion phenomena strongly depends on the of the intensity of the of the stabilizer, where here in the denominator there is a saturated intensity of the of the.",
            "Of that, over the dye, and also here, I show that here is the lateral resolution where you know that this is this classical classical based criteria and it's or its improved by this factor.",
            "So and again you see there is the ratio between the intensity of the stabilizer and saturated.",
            "So so in the bigger is this one then the resolution resolution is better.",
            "And of course theoretically it's like unlimited resolution.",
            "But of course that when this.",

        [
            "OK, and the last point what I told you that it's important that we are not doing the depletion in the same place and here is how it looks like when making the image.",

            "This one so we are doing it with this.",
            "This is called a face plate.",
            "So as you can see that so all this approach is called like destructive interference.",
