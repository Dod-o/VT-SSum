            "Is the outer body, the inner body of the air?",
            "Then I have the wheel.",

            "Such elements yes, be cause if we leave it like this.",
            "Here we have a very very sharp angle and were very difficult to mess, so I will put some very structural mesh there anyway.",
            "This is not an important.",
            "Region because there there is not moving too fast.",
            "Or maybe it does as we will see later but is not affected.",
            "They are the names of the body so.",
            "Now, for fluent, you need to put all these bodies under the same part, so you see we have only one part which is called domain.",
            "This is why usually I use as a name and then under this we have all these bodies and this is in order to create.",
            "Conformal mess.",
            "So by default there would be no.",
            "Double faces it will be common faces between bodies, so I in a natural way the mess that will create it will be conformal.",
            "OK, there's no point in going through what things I did hear.",
            "This file came from ones is this is a demo parasolid file for this car used for demonstrations.",
            "As you can see the wheels have some gap.",
            "Between the wheel and the.",
            "Body of the car.",
            "This would be a little bit difficult.",
            "To model to mess.",
            "OK.",
            "The wheel is extruding outside of the car.",
            "Which is not.",
            "Quite normal, so I don't know if this is a supercar as UV car, but it looks like 1, maybe with very large wheels.",
            "Anyway, we're going to study this car, so just close that you don't need to save it as you know and go to messaging.",
            "Now DoubleClick messing and as is missing, will open and we're going to create a message for this application.",
            "OK, so.",
            "I have already created an inner volume so that I can control the mess in space, but of course this is not enough I need.",
            "Also, to put some controls so if you see connections there are no connections 'cause this was a multi body part.",
            "The geometric gate game OK 6.",
            "Board is one part.",
            "Now if you expand missing you will see that I have put.",
            "Some controls, so typically even for industrial scale applications you will have something between 10 to 30 controls, not more than that, you should be able to create a good mess without any more controls.",
            "So.",
            "Let's have a look what I did here because the target, depending on what we learn previously, is what we need to have a good mess, which means it has been fine near the gradients.",
            "Where are we?",
            "Have we have steep gradients?",
            "In this type of low.",
            "Anybody?",
            "Large gradients in this type of flow.",
            "On the car.",
            "For sure, maybe in between the wheel in the car.",
            "Obviously this small gap, but anyway, this is small.",
            "We are going to resolve it anyway, but we need final remains near the car and expanding as we are moving outside of the car.",
            "So first we start with face missing.",
            "So I selected.",
            "This surface is and I said I need I want a mess.",
            "OK let's go to millimeters.",
            "I wouldn't mess off.",
            "25 millimeters so something like this.",
            "It should be OK, right?",
            "Then the wheels the wheels as we will discuss later are rotating.",
            "OK, let's go first for the boundary conditions.",
            "Who is moving the car or the air?",
            "In reality the car, but it's more convenient to move the air right so we have 0.",
            "Would be 0 you there will be minus that you got.",
            "The real you got.",
            "Nice.",
            "So this also allow us to use a uniform profile here.",
            "Because actually there is no boundary layer between the air and in the ground, the air is stationary.",
            "The car is moving, so the air.",
            "If we take the negative, it would change coordinate systems.",
            "We will have a uniform profile, so be careful we don't have to have.",
            "A developer file here, but we also have to take care of that.",
            "The wings are rotated.",
            "They the same thing.",
            "They also do in Winternals winternals.",
            "For cars they are not stationary.",
            "They have no bells and the wheels is rotating in the correct rotation speed based on the velocity that this wind tunnel is going to be measured so.",
            "The wheels are rotating, so I'm using a finer mesh of 15 millimeters for the wheels as well as the I don't know the name of the bodyguard that surrounds the wheels.",
            "No.",
            "OK, only in Greek, so the inner size would be.",
            "50 millimeters, of course it would be 25 and 10 millimeters or the surface and it will eventually expand and go to 50 millimeters Ford in your body.",
            "Then I'm declaring that this would be a path conforming tetrahedral mesh method.",
            "I'm doing inflation everywhere with eight layers.",
            "With smooth transition, smooth transition means that as is missing, would decide how thick the layer would be based on the surface mess.",
            "So this would be fine are on the will and it will be thicker on the car and in between the wheel in the in the car automatically.",
            "The mess will be.",
            "Using this algorithm.",
            "Layer compression so the layers will be compressed in order to fit in the gap.",
            "As we will see from the result.",
            "By the way, just click update so that the message being prepared and then we can discuss about it.",
            "So click update.",
            "So that the end of the discussion we have the mess.",
            "OK, and I'm going on with the discussion now.",
            "I want to give some instructions also of how to transition the mess from the inner to the outer volume.",
            "So I'm using some edge missing here.",
            "OK, expanding.",
            "So 10 times.",
            "So this one is 10 times smaller than the last one.",
            "OK, the same for upstream.",
            "Don't ask me exactly how did it.",
            "It takes a little bit of experience in some trials.",
            "It's not just like in one go.",
            "I did some trials before I ended up with this mess, which is acceptable is not the best we can do, but.",
            "It is good to get some results.",
            "The same also the same method for the large volume parts conforming inflation.",
            "I'm using inflation on the floor.",
            "Sorry on the ground.",
            "The ground is also a wall, so we need to find are.",
            "Messing on the wall on the on this wall.",
            "I'm declaring a larger size for the outer volume of 300 millimeters.",
            "And for the height, I put some.",
            "Numbers 100 meters it's good.",
            "OK, just to make sure that it will not expand too much.",
            "Lateral in the inlet.",
            "I realized that in a lead we're having too much to do large elements or I put also this one and sizing slices.",
            "This is, I think, near the wheels.",
            "Yeah, so I selected this.",
            "Slices I called them and I put 5 millimeters so.",
            "Then I have put the boundary condition families so symmetry.",
            "This is finished already.",
            "No summer.",
            "Everybody.",
            "You're supposed to be working OK. Let's go to machine.",
            "So the message was created here.",
            "The graphics are not.",
            "Memory.",
            "I'm not sure because I was getting this one at home, so I changed something but it works for the for Windows.",
            "It shouldn't be a problem because it's not a large mesh.",
            "OK, if I deactivate inflation OK, we can try to solve it.",
            "And if not, we can use up my Windows machine.",
            "OK, so.",
            "OK, let's try to.",
            "To create the mess.",
            "OK, we'll start first with this small mess, so.",
            "So.",
            "Four bodies, right click, create mission, selected bodies.",
            "I will first create this mess, OK?",
            "And then.",
            "Is there any mess on this body?",
            "As you might know.",
            "You can create Eric recorded sequence of matching.",
            "Because as as you miss different bodies, this missing procedure has to respect existing messing.",
            "So first I make sure that this small volumes that they were problematic before this plate are messed OK and then I proceed.",
            "There's no need to mess the whole thing without making sure that the problematic areas were solved.",
            "OK, let's see what happens.",
            "Do you have this directory solved?",
            "I don't remember if we uploaded this.",
            "Do you have this one?",
            "Is there a directly solved?",
            "There is.",
            "OK. Because here.",
            "The mesh file exists.",
            "OK, so.",
            "We can OK.",
            "If this is not solve OK, the same error.",
            "Alright, let's go through this mess.",
            "In my computer, so I will.",
            "Because it's exactly the same settings, so for some reason is not.",
            "Being reproduced in Linux.",
            "So we'll have a look here and anyway, the next of the tutorial for you depends on fluent and if you have this directory, you have the file we need, so no problem.",
            "So I will open.",
            "OK. Actually, I can directly open the message file.",
            "So.",
            "This is a temp, so this is missed OK?",
            "So this is a mess file.",
            "I will open so we can see the result.",
            "We can discuss a little bit about the mess and then we can move on.",
            "So here's the message.",
            "You see, there's a boundary layer on the ground.",
            "It becomes.",
            "Smoothly.",
            "More fine.",
            "And this is a boundary layer around the car.",
            "You see all around.",
            "Is busy is it clear?",
            "Do we need to switch off some lights maybe?",
            "Again, if you want to have a look inside what happens inside, you can use.",
            "Selection paint planes.",
            "I have pretty fine some of them.",
            "So if I.",
            "For the first, you need to do it twice to show this is a bug, definitely, but.",
            "OK, so here's a slice you see eventually, smoothly with 20%.",
            "Low coming from this size.",
            "OK, this size is the size of 300.",
            "Maybe you know 300 and then when it approaches and here's the bridge with 100, how much data I don't remember.",
            "There's a gradual transition and then.",
            "Here you see this is.",
            "The boundary layer based.",
            "On the smooth transition, so based on the surface mesh we have a boundary layer of eight.",
            "Layers with a 1.220% rule and as we approach the gap.",
            "Obviously this and this do not fit in this gap, so there's a layer suppression.",
            "Gradually the boundary layer becomes finer.",
            "Here and then they fit in the gap 88 and some in between.",
            "The same here as well.",

            "You have to have all processors delivering the same result at the same time, so it's vital that they have the same load.",
            "Another good.",

            "So this internal boundary should be as small as possible so that the information they give to each other for this small amount of time before they can move on to the next one is as minimal as possible, so this is what you are trying to do in fluent, have almost the same number of loading and also the internal cuts are as small as possible so that the exchange of information itself will also lost their very small.",

            "After six you will get something but not the idea.",
