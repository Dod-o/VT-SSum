            "OK, Um, who of you have done that in Owl?",
            "OK, and who of you has used the methodology during the process?",
            "OK.",
            "Yes, even then it's perfect that we're going to talk about that today.",
            "So basically, methodology you could think of it as some kind of.",

            "OK, so first of all.",

            "First of all, you have the ontology development process.",
            "You have the ontology lifecycle.",

            "So why?",
            "Why a methodology?",
            "So basically the methodology is one of the means.",
            "You can have to support novice users in building ontologies.",
            "So normally if you have an expert.",
            "They will have everything in their head memorized.",
            "I think it's the same like have you has already developed software.",
            "I think most of you have some background in doing that and they're like in theory you also have all these elaborate models like I don't know, wonderful model or.",
            "Like circular models.",
            "And two of you follows one of those models when they develop.",
            "Software OK.",
            "But like do you read it every time again or do you have it memorized and just do it naturally?",
            "Yeah, see, that's exactly the point.",
            "So when you when you get more experienced in designing software ontologies you more or less have your own process or you have the process memorized by hard.",
            "So it's not like OK you go back to the list.",
            "OK, now step one.",
            "OK do that Step 2 but you have some sort of internal model.",

            "So as you see, there's some sort of distinction between ontology engineering and ontology users, and as Peter already said, she could also think of the right side as ontology runtime.",
            "So what you actually do with the ontology.",
            "And yeah, we will not focus too much on ontology usage today, but mainly on the development process.",

            "What do we need?",
            "What are our constraints so to say?",

            "Philosophical upper level ontology for everything that exists in the world.",
            "And yeah, we will learn a little bit about ontology development and the methodology today in, like different presentations, we will start here and we will also have a hands-on section on that later.",
            "Then integration refers to if you nowadays have more modularized approach was ontology that you can actually integrate different ontologies of parts of ontologies into the ontology that you have developed.",
            "This is also something where the reuse comes in.",
            "Valuation is always important.",
            "We will also have something like a valuation later in the presentation.",
            "How do you assess your ontology?",
            "And yeah, basically this is also more less so cycle, so if during the evaluation you find out that you miss something, you go back to development.",
            "And so on until you're finally ready and say, OK, let's deploy it, then goes into usage during usage.",
            "Normally what you would do is you would populate the ontology.",
            "That means that for example, domain experts could come and say, well, these are all individuals I see in the domain and let's just put them into the ontology and group them according to the classes and concepts.",

            "You find out their mistakes.",
            "Then you have to take care of them and remove the mistakes.",

            "This is basically.",
            "Yeah, taxi can perform with the ontology at runtime.",
            "You can use it to search content.",
            "You can use it to retrieve certain data, or you can also perform reasoning with it.",

            "Focus on the left side and will get into that.",

            "So this is something that you might better read in your print out there on your own screen.",
            "Just the font size is not so big.",
            "So basically what you see here is OK. What are normally the activities that are carried out during each step of this ontology lifecycle during the engineering aspects?",
            "So for example, you have a feasibility study environmental study.",
            "And scheduling going on all is part of the requirement lists.",

            "Some are more or less stuff that runs in the background like versioning.",
            "You should normally have a tool taking care of that.",
            "And annotation this is also something that you always do on the fly within the tool.",
            "So not all activities are always noted as being standalone activities, but somehow somehow integrated in the tool in a way that you just perform them while you do your natural modeling.",

            "Yeah, but this just as a disclaimer, so this is not the goal.",

            "You think about what is actually.",

            "We will talk about research today in our examples, which might make sense because research something that you all should know about.",
            "You are here at the scientific conference.",
            "The normal owl example would be the pizza Ontology, but they somehow found out that it's not universal.",
            "So in Asia, people don't really know about pizza, so they don't really know about how to model it.",
            "But research should be somehow universal for all the people here, so we chose that domain.",
            "So first of all, you think OK?",
            "What are entities and can encounter in the universe of discourse so, but think about it well, we hear the conference.",
            "The conference would be one of those entities for research.",
            "We have publications, we have presentations, we have present us, we have PhD students, professors and so on.",
            "So these would all be entities in the universe of discourse in our ontology.",
            "Then you think about OK, how do they all relate?",
            "How do they fit together?",
            "I would say well.",
            "Somehow PhD student and professor both are persons, so they could be grouped under person.",

            "Then there could be also something like presenting at.",
            "Conference.",
            "So this is not something that is like a class, but rather it's the relationship between the presenter and maybe the conference where you present.",
            "Or maybe the paper that you present depending on how you're actually modeled.",
            "So this is meant by distinguish independent concepts from relationship roles.",
            "We will get an example of that in a second.",
            "So then you somehow built a taxonomy of concepts anybody does not know what it taxonomy is.",

            "So this is actually just what I described.",

            "If two classes are disjoint, they cannot share common individuals or instances.",
            "So if we say that PhD student is disjoined from Professor, that would mean there can be no individual that is both Professor or PhD student.",

            "I mean could be the case that really decides to get another PhD and roles in some University.",
            "And then it would not be valid modeling, but normally stuff that work are male and female.",
            "You could say male and female is disjoint.",

            "For him, Aphrodite would have your own class most likely.",
            "OK, this is meant by disjointness.",
            "Then you have band relations and attributes.",
            "OK, binary relations.",
            "Who are you with modeled as modeled relations are?",
            "Object properties as they called and I will think most of you will have developed ontologies have also developed some relations not only OK.",
            "So that is good.",
            "Then you know what that means.",
            "We will also have examples for that, so formalized this is normally the step where you actually.",

            "Have to look like care too much about whether it's true in reality.",
            "So for example, if you would do an ontology about unicorns, that would be totally fine for an application ontology, but philosophers would say, well there are no unicorns.",

            "Complete what do you mean by Glossary?",
            "So you mean like the whole entity finding OK?",
            "How long it takes?",
            "Yeah, that depends on actually the domain you choose.",
            "So as I said, each ontology has a domain.",
            "For example, we chose research as a domain.",
            "And based on that, you somehow limit the number of concepts and relations or entities as we rename everything here that you can find in the domain.",
            "So if I wanted to have an ontology that models everything that is in the world, of course I would have like much bigger universe of discourse, so naturally it would take longer to find all the entities if ever other limited domain.",

            "I mean, this is this really difficult questions because it also depends on the person doing the development fees like experienced domain expert who has done that.",
            "Large maybe has some sort of internal way to enumerating through all the different entities and finding them faster than somebody who has just started and things OK University.",
            "Yeah, what else is there?",
            "OK there could be yeah research projects.",
            "I mean it's a tough question.",
            "I would say it depends.",
            "More less.",
