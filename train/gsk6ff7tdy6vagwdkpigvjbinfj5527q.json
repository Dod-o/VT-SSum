            "Clear talk about this general loop of scientific work where you generate hypothesis and testing purposes.",
            "Then you will see the systems biology more on the generating hypothesis side and synthetic biology more.",

            "I mean, I'm perhaps a bit conservative, so I believe that it's really a big advantage to have a good biological insight into the processes, but with some help with such a complex synthetic pathways I cannot even memorize all the the elements that they take part.",

            "This is the beginning of our discussion, and I think that.",
            "I think for for the computer science people, at least for myself, to make it easier to to relate to what you were telling us.",
            "Essentially what you were presenting us, where the Model S the results at which you had arrived.",
            "So you were talking about the genetical engineered machines you have synthesized, but not really so much about process when most alternative designs you considered why you decided about that particular design.",

            "I I know that this is yes, yes yes.",

            "And so here in in the end they have been degree automated.",
            "So what we will need to discuss really is what are the alternative designs you can see there how you select among those designs.",
            "In this particular case, the problem is of course the time limit, 'cause the older projects have to be finished by the beginning of November and the students start work somewhere end of June, so there's always time problem and that I'm usually we come from plan A to Plan B and plan C and so on.",
            "But in general I would say for almost any of those problems there are probably several different solutions.",
            "So we thought about some, some some other ways and I think there are probably many more ways.",
            "Perhaps some of them are better than others.",
            "I mean, we don't really have the tools, but clearly to really test to get some information that you might perhaps be more appreciate more would be probably to have a bit broader set of results, perhaps to have a DNA array of.",
            "Of, let's say the effect of this might be 88 dominant negative activation on on the transcriptome or something like that.",
            "And then I think clearly you would get more quantitative information where you could perhaps more numbers where where you could really work with them.",

            "I mean, of course there are many, particularly on on on proteins that are at the heart of that are very highly connected then then you likely affect many other things so so I clearly would not want to be to have my diety insert it into my cells.",
