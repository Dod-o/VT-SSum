            "And the idea is that this polymer is then bound in a matrix of another problem that in that way you prevent leaching from the coating and our knowledge is also in mainly to make sure that this polymer always migrate to the surface, because it will only work when is at the surface.",

            "So for example, we are talking about decreasing the infection.",

            "So.",

            "After that that it also will.",
