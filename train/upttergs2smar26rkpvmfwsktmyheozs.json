            "And many times such sites have actually a small small group group of collective participants who are somehow driving the site right?",
            "And this core participants take place in many different tasks.",

            "And once these decisions are made one someone has to carry them out right?",
            "So there is sort of the enforcement part.",

            "And Wikipedia, just an example of that where we actually have a log of how people made this evaluations.",

            "So what we're thinking about is we have about are we who is trying to evaluate or decide how to vote on candidates see and what we find that the way the voter votes heavily depends on the relationship between B&C.",

            "So for every vote we know when and who casted it.",
            "So we had data between January.",
            "Sorry, September 2004 in January 2008, on almost 2800 elections and 44% of these 2800 elections resulted in a promotion.",
            "So about half of them were successful.",
            "Then if we break these elections apart, what we find out.",
            "The elections that resulted in promotion almost 95% of all the votes in those elections were support walls, and then similarly or, on the other hand, for the elections that failed in promotion, only 31% of the votes were positive.",
            "But we also find is that successful election have many times like are very long, have around 100 votes, while failed elections usually get closed early and they have, you know, on average 30 or less votes.",
            "And you can also see this difference between the successful and failed elections on this histogram here.",
            "Where I'm plotting the number, the fraction of final fraction of support votes versus the number of such elections, and I'm again breaking successful versus failed elections.",
            "So in this 2800 elections there were 114 thousand votes and overall almost 80% of all the votes are support votes.",
            "1 interesting feature of this voting is that every vote can get commented or discussed, and what we basically find is that for support votes they very rarely get discussed or commented while the opposing votes.",

            "7500 of them were voters and 2500 of them were candidates.",

Then around zero, the two merits are both nodes have about the same merit, and then to the far right merit of these larger than the merit of C, and basically what we find is that sort of generally the whole thing has this decreasing trend.",

            "Prior to the election and another one is how many different words have they edited when they talked or how many words they exchanged and what we find is that for the number of talks we have, this like diminishing returns type of increase, while for the number of words they exchanged.",
