            "There's the streaming API, which, like the fire hose.",
            "Is real time data, but it is a sample of the fire hose, so the fire hose is in theory every tweet in real time that's being produced on Twitter.",
            "The streaming API is some sample of that data, but Twitter doesn't document for us very well what that means, and in some instances it may be that the stream actually is 100% of the firehose, but we don't have a whole lot of knowledge about when that's the case.",
            "Whether it's the case in the first place.",
            "The search API is nested within the larger REST API.",

            "For those of you who use the API's you know full well that there are multiple ways that you can query the API's.",
            "The search API in particular, you can use to collect the full timeline of someones tweets within some limitations.",
            "But what I'm interested in here is when we do research using particular keyword queries, how does that data come back to us?",
            "It is the streaming API is as I just mentioned, a real time capture and it can capture up to 1%.",
            "Of all global volume.",
            "So we know for certain Twitter tells us in its documentation that they will rate limit right the return of our data if the query parameters that we've entered go above 1% of all global Twitter volume at a given moment in time.",
            "So if an issue or event is particularly popular, it's very likely that you're going to be rate limited because the volume of that issue or event that you're querying is much higher than or even slightly higher than 1% of global volume.",
            "This is also a problem when my fellow countrymen and women go to sleep or on vacation, so when Americans decrease their volume of tweeting, it's much more likely that those of us trying to capture the data are going to get rate limited.",
            "Because the overall volume of 20 of tweets being produced is depressed, Americans are still by far the highest volume users of Twitter.",
            "So when we go on vacation or go to sleep.",

            "One thing to know about the streaming API and this is something that a lot of people don't talk about too much.",
            "But when we query the various APIs it actually queries different parts of a tweet.",
