            "If at this moment is around 80% of the population by the year of 2050, it it will be 16% which is double of the current situation.",
            "And what is even more alarming is that the ratio of the working age.",

            "Groups of researchers that do activity recognition on one side or the ones that prefer environmental sensors that are put inside the sofas or in the bats, they most of them use camera based approaches and they put as I said, sensors throughout the environment and on the other side is the group that actually works with body worn sensors or wearable sensors and that may look something like this.",

            "Also the camera based approach is still complex, requires still complex compute computation which cannot be performed in real time.",
            "And of course if you have camera you always have the user privacy issues.",
            "Probably the biggest problem with this approach.",
            "And on the other side, we have the wearable sensors.",
            "The advantages are that they are person specific, so the person that wears the sensor actually is the person that is monitored by this sensors.",
            "They're more more accurate for everyday activities.",
            "I'll show with the next slides they're coming cheaper and cheaper with the increasing development of the technology.",
            "And of course some of them can be used outdoors.",
