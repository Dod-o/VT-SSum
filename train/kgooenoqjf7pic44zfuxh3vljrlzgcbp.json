            "So we search for the word beer now instead of taking TFIDF, we're going to use our score to rank it, so the result is get some tweets that are, but because they contain the word beer, but also they have a high probability of being retweeted, so hopefully these tweets are going to be interesting if you search."

            "Yeah, we have.",

            "We tried it out, but I think our sample size was not so big so we said something like a research shows that.",
            "How to be retreated and we put a question mark and formulated it as a question and so on, and some people retweeted it.",
            "But yeah, I mean we don't have so many followers, so maybe we should all follow us and then we could make that experiment again.",
            "Yes dear.",
            "My question is in so much with research, but the way you presented some things, which is you you sort of made the power station causality error.",
            "You kept stating if you want to achieve XD why supply and causal relationship between services.",
            "Correlation?",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "So so so what's unclear is that you actually capture.",
            "What makes things more likely to be repeated versus?",
            "You know some some epiphenomenal of what got retweeted?",
            "Yes, so so the actual questions that we want to answer is what other interesting tweets and how can we find them in search?",
            "So and of course.",
            "We could use that that result for ourselves to say because we all want to be treated, so we're going to apply that knowledge for ourselves.",
            "So first question is now, does it work?",
            "Does it not work?",
            "Think that's something that you would have to find out by trying it out.",
            "So for example, people with a large amount of followers tend not to be as negative and get retweeted quite a lot, but they won't show up nearly as often in a corpus as to many, many people would not too many followers who may be repeated because they tend to be negative.",
            "You can't, you can't.",
            "You can't tell me that was a wrong hypothesis for what you've done something right?",
            "So numbers you haven't so.",
            "So you make your claiming causality relationship as.",
            "Postal correlates.",
            "You need to go back now and say which causes what is it?",
            "Yeah, negative things actually caused it to be repeated or more interested.",
            "Or is it just that in a large sample set because of the long tail distribution, more things from that end are growing up?",
            "Things like that exact so.",
            "Of course, if you have lots of followers, then more people are going to see you, so that's an effect that I mean that's really well known that who in who influences the topics on Twitter and so on.",
            "And here the idea was to say we don't want to look at that explicitly.",
            "We really.",
            "Let's take only the tweet itself and try to predict when it's going to be retweeted.",
            "Yes, I'm just.",
            "Interesting this week we got that paper and next month but I should resend, which requires one usefulness.",
            "Compare those two terms.",
            "Only white men could interesting.",
            "This is opposed to something else, yes, so so the question was how can we measure interesting this of tweet?",
            "So taking pic edits?",
            "Retweeted is a pretty simple thing to measure, 'cause you have the it's in the same data set and we do.",
            "We do look for tweets that contain the same text prefixed with some pattern or suffix with via.",
            "Username and song.",
            "Combinations of those pictures helps music videos with your agent if you want.",
            "When we tried it one at a time and all features together.",
            "OK, so one exactly, but of course the idea is that if use logistic regression to run these weights that you get good combination so you can.",
            "Learn something from the weights that you get.",
            "We take the opposite methodology, says instance Erk.",
            "Let's talk about it offline.",
            "I had a quick question for you.",
            "Then you reported the results from the largest of three datasets.",
            "Yeah, do you suspect that if you did the analysis in the other data sets, the results would be consistent?",
            "In what kind of work?",
            "That and they were pretty similar, but they were statistically.",
            "We prefer the lashes.",
            "Any other accounts?",
