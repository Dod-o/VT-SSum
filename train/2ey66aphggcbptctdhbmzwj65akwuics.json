            "With the project that actually has, I'm still worried with what you're saying, but you know you're not working full time project anymore in your little bit worried about future development, it seems like this is a project that is really poised that you actually could perhaps sell commercial version for businesses and corporations.",
            "You could sell support contracts you could you know, for my nonprofit and have someone running right before to pay someone, it's possible I have, you know, I haven't really had a lot of time to think about that or work on it.",
            "So that's, but there's definitely something that I'm interested in pursuing is particularly nonprofit.",
            "Sort of foundation.",
