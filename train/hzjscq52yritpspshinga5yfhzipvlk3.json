            "As he said I might cover with Amazon Web Services and before we get started, first of all apologies that I can only speak English, but before we get started, how many people in the room had heard of Amazon Web Services before they heard about this meeting?",
            "Oh wow.",
            "OK, how many of you have tried them?",
            "OK, no, that's that's about normal.",
            "OK, So what I'm going to do if this sounds agreeable to everybody is I'm going to kind of divide this talk into three parts.",
            "I'm going to start by talking a little bit about what it means to be successful as a startup because bears Love told me that there's a number of folks in this community that are thinking about start up the kinds of things.",
            "But even if you're not thinking about being a software startup, it's still a really good way to look at at, say, a project.",

            "So for example in the UK Marks and Spencers website we run.",
            "The other half of that line of business are vendors who sell through the Amazon platform.",

            "Have any of you in like since the first of the year stopped using Facebook?",
            "Yeah, OK, so some of you know, as many as I might have expected because I find this kind of fascinating too.",

            "Maybe you really don't need a web server as such at all, but these are all the kinds of things that you need to think about when you're either planning a startup, are planning a project.",

            "It works a lot like raid.",
            "That is, that there's multiple nodes for the data stripe across inside our data center, and the idea there is that if something happens.",

            "And of course, behind the scenes we do things like take the defective rack offline, bring in a blank rack, rebuild the data so that it's always available.",
            "But we take it one step further.",
            "We actually replicate the entire data center in real time so that there's multiple real time data centers, all synchronized with each other, and that way if there's a problem with the entire data center.",
            "So, for example, somebody cut the fiber in the parking lot, or you know the switch to the data center goes down, something like that.",

            "So the other half is this business model that goes with all of these web services.",

            "On how many objects are the total number of petabytes that you put into a bucket?",

            "By that I mean that you probably couldn't use.",
            "In fact, I know you couldn't use the bucket name images because somebody else already took it.",

            "That's the full filename, but when I call as a developer, when I write code to call this, what I can do is, let's say that there's 10,000,000 objects in this bucket, and 100 of them start with 2005 slash.",
            "What I can do is when I call the when I call the web service, the list API to get a.",
            "List of what's in there.",
            "I can tell it that you show me everything starting with 2005, and by the way, I'd like to use a/ as a delimiter.",
            "So what I can do with those two parameters is basically treat that encode is if it were a subdirectory, it's pretty easy, but while technically it's not.",
            "Now the other thing I want to show you though is this is this is really good to know about.",
            "This looks like a DNS name and in fact it is a DNS name.",
            "So it's a fully qualified DNS name.",
            "It has to be all lower case and what you can do is you can create a bucket, for example media.mydomain.com and then in your own DNS server you put in a C name or a Canonical name entry that says all requests for media.mydomain.com should be sent to M or it's two S3 Amazon AW s.com and when we see that inbound request we check to see if there's a bucket by that name.",
            "And if there is, then we look for an object by the name that you specified.",
            "You know like image1.jpg and if we find that then we check permissions.",
            "Now there's an access control list just as there would be with the file system with each of these objects.",
            "So by default only you have permission and you have to send in that that signature as part of your request.",
            "However, you can also do things like market fully public so that anybody can have access to it, and in that case all you have to do is send in HTTP: wack wack media.mydomain.com/image, one dot JPEG and it gets served up.",
            "So it turns out that that's a really good way to do things like deliver software downloads in a very inexpensive way.",

            "Now that sounds a little different, to say the least, but it turns out actually this is pretty brilliant, because if you if you make that assumption or Mary if you put the message back in the queue automatically means you don't have to write in any exception code because the message just came back.",

            "First of all, there's this notion of availability zones, so when you sign up for EC2, you're assigned 3 availability zones a BMC.",
            "Ann, you need to think about your architecture and how you want to optimize the idea with availability zones is that if you distribute your servers, if you have more than one server, if you distribute them across availability zones, then if we have a problem your data, I mean your servers are much more likely to be available if we had some sort of problem because you know it will only probably affect 1 availability zone.",
            "However, there's times when you want very high performance and you don't care about as much.",
            "We've very high performance between instances, and you don't care as much about availability, and in that case you want to make certain that you put them all in the same availability zone, and in fact, if you're moving data not between, for example as three in EC2, but between EC2 instances and the EC2 instances you're moving between our across an availability zone, we do charge one 1 cent per GB to move between availability zones.",
            "We just announced these last weeks, which is why I forgot to mention him.",
            "And then there's also a notion of static IPS, or we call them elastic IPS, so you can actually allocate a fixed IP address and then assign it to your machines, and then if you need to.",
            "So let's say that availability zone a goes away.",
            "You can deallocate it from that.",
            "The machine that went away and reassign it to a new machine in a different availability zone, or use it in any way you want.",
            "An fixed or elastic IPS.",
            "The assigned IPS, or there's no cost for these as long as you're using them.",
            "But if you are not using them, we charge 1 penny per hour to keep it.",
            "If you're not actually using it.",
            "And that's just to conserve IP addresses.",
            "OK, maybe one more question.",

            "OK, so what's behind this?",
            "Oh yeah, but then I'd have to shoot you.",
            "So the answer is we don't talk about that, and it's constantly growing.",
            "I should point.",
