            "And we didn't really know how much audience were how much.",
            "Success we were going to have at attracting this kind of people, so we very initially shooting for about 30 students or starting it small compared to other schools an we did I have to say we didn't do such a great job, but actually advertising the the boot camp in advance and that was partly lucky because we got well over 40 applications which was more than we expected and that actually forced us to change a little bit.",

            "That sort of seemed genuinely interested in in in the boot camp, and actually there were three no shows.",

            "One that we didn't get from the students, but it was obvious from the from the just being there is that we don't have that many casualties.",
            "I mean there were ten quite intense days.",
            "I mean there were seven hours per day of hard work, so it was easy to start.",

            "The theory the split of sessions we did in theory and lab seemed to work well.",
            "We had theory sessions in the lectures in the morning and the lab sessions in the afternoon, and most of the students said that it was a good idea that many of the instructors state for most of the of course, right?",
            "So it was not only then delivering the lectures and leaving, but they were around for asking more questions after.",
            "After that, that was really an effort that I think was made on the part of the instructions and for which we have to be really thankful and most of the students also remarked the.",
            "The opportunity of having of having other colleagues around or fellow students around for almost 2 weeks so as a chance of doing good networking.",
            "Some feedback that we got later and that I haven't written here is that actually some of the lectures are three.",
            "Three as far as I think 3 is I if I remember correctly, are among the top 100 most viewed lectures in the video lectures.",
            "Session, which is good.",
            "Most remarkably the lecture by Michaela Keller on on the introduction to probability, which says two things.",
            "I think one is we were lucky with the teachers we got, maybe especially with Michaela and 2nd that maybe there is a need for such introduction.",
            "Introductory material for people who want to learn from say the net on the minus side we of course realized that the students came with quite diverse.",

            "That's of course a consequence of the kind of audience we were looking for, but we should really try to think of something to smooth this down.",
            "If if you want to repeat the experience, the lab sessions were intense and students said it would have been.",
            "Better idea not to have them on close times say make it make them sort of open ended so that they really still wanted to use more time working on them and we did get a good number of people asking for having prerequisites published before and suggesting readings.",
            "So one way of attacking maybe the problem of the diverse background and also this last point that we thought of was maybe the vote the 1st.",
            "Two days of the bootcamp to basic lectures, more or less like we did, but make clear to the students that they can also skip those if they want.",
            "If they think they already have a good background and just arrive on the third day so they don't get bored if they know the basics.",
