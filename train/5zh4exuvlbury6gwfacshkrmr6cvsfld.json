            "But then the expert actually labeled as class one, so then you could say that this is somehow kind contradicting with the observations of patterns and therefore what I'm going to do is that maybe this was misclassified, I will give less waiting to this instance when I'm trying to build a classifier, so we have done those kinds of things and we found by doing that you can actually build incredibly robust classifiers.",
