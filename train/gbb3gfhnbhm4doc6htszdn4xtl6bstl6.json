            "The thing is, you need to develop a relationship and trust and believe word and this does not come from 145 minute pitch.",
            "You give to an investor, but it's a long process.",
            "It takes time, so usually investments, at least the bigger ones will take from 6 to 9 months.",
            "At least or even more.",
            "So if you don't know that it can be very frustrating.",
            "So the second step is you have to know when you're ready, because business ideas only usually do not get funded.",
            "I mean usually because if you are not a serial entrepreneur with outstanding track record, you will not get funded based on your idea.",
            "The at least what you need is a prototype.",
            "Even better if you have your first customers.",

            "You need to prepare the documentation.",

            "The first thing you do you do not send business plan, discuss.",
            "Venture capitalists usually don't read business plans 'cause they're just too long and boring, and especially if you get a couple of dozen business plans per week.",
            "It can be quite boring, so the deck after that when you get the feedback that they are interested, you send them executive summary which is a short two to three pages where you describe your business idea.",
            "And after that, if you get the feedback again that they are still interested, they want to know more.",
            "You send them your business plan which hopefully hopefully is not longer than 20 pages.",

            "These are the general partners you want to talk to so.",
            "When you successfully approached them then you get the opportunity opportunity to do the pitch.",
            "Here again, you have to know exactly what you're talking about, so it means you have to.",
            "Prepare and train and train and train and when you come to the investor you need to know what you have to talk about.",
            "There is a lot of this on the Internet so I'm not going to bore you with that.",
            "But as it looks at team is the most important one.",
            "You need to present the team efficiently.",
            "Then the market the pain you're solving, your financials, business model and so on.",
            "After that for me, what I saw is very, very important point.",
            "This is further meetings and updates after your successful pitch you need to update your investors and about your progress.",
            "The progress you're doing every two to three weeks for the next few following months.",
            "So it's a long process again and after that you're probably.",
            "If you're successful, you got the term shit before you sign it.",
            "You have to negotiate it.",
            "The problem with the term sheet is 'cause there's whole lot of terms and terminology or not familiar with plus 'cause you're a young company not yet selling your product.",
            "Usually it's hard to figure out what the what the market value of your company actually is.",
            "So the best thing here is to get a couple of term sheets from different investors.",
            "If you're lucky enough so.",
            "Based on that, you get a strong, stronger negotiating position that works well.",
            "Do you signed the term sheet?",
            "You got to do the due diligence which already Rock talked about after the successful due diligence you signed the deal.",

            "I'm involved in a program with Stanford University where they have a lot of startup companies and I'm counseling them on data protection, but they're also asking for advice on just this topic and.",
            "Do you have any advice for people who are just starting down this path?",
            "Very bright people with great ideas who are trying to eventually get venture capitalists to fund them.",

            "So how do you get from from that step to where you are now?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Basic advice would be don't approach the VCs too early, so unless you are as as Meta said, unless you are Siri Intrapreneur with track record then perhaps you'll get funded on any idea, but these occasions are fewer and very far between.",
            "If you're a young, start up with no track record, you gotta bootstrap yourself for awhile.",
            "I mean you gotta get to the step where you have something to show for.",
            "Favorably a client that's that's a great, but at least proof of concept you need to get there and you can get there with some other means of financing before coming to the VC world.",

            "Financing out there there's.",
            "There's crowdsourcing.",

            "Don't start with VCs too soon because Mattie said even in a smaller environment like Slovenia, we get lots of proposals and so you.",

            "Do your homework seldom will you get the second chance.",
            "But there's plenty of money out there chasing good projects.",
            "So don't be afraid, just just go for it.",

            "Actually seen as as an experience that somebody is bringing along and knows how to deal with failure and pick themselves up.",
