            "The space for it is very very small.",
            "Despite this we also looked at the address city and the level of retweets in the sample, and we also found 31% of the messages contained an @ in line with previous research.",
            "So again we see people are not just posting opinions, not just posting links, but they're exchanging ideas that are discussing things in the high level of retweets.",
            "Actually is a sign that they're finding interesting information, noteworthy information that they're sharing with their friends, right?",
            "So then let's move on to participation because that's an interesting issue with with Jensen Coop, but they found in their in their message board in Canada.",
            "I think was that 3% of all of the users responsible for 1/3 of the messages, so it was a highly skewed distribution.",
            "And when we look at our distribution, we have different categories of user groups or one time use users that have only posted one political message in that time frame and then up to heavy users with more than 80 messages.",
            "And that is a categorization that we adopt from.",
            "That other study and what's interesting, the distribution of users is the exact same that they found on message boards, and so that's almost one to one.",
            "But then if you look at the distribution of messages, it's even more more unequal.",
            "So we see .6% of all users the very heavy users to be responsible for more than 21% of the messages and then heavy users.",

            "Any tweet can mention more than one party, right?",
