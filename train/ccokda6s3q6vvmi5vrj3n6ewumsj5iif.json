            "Partners to talk with them about what's coming up for the next two or three years from hours to already prepare them to build their solution to adapt their business on what is coming.",
            "You so that at the point when we introducing a new technology or new product, they already aware of their builds, a solution on top of it, they can stand up and say, yeah, I'm using it already, so that's why we talk all the evangelism.",
            "So I said, I'm praying now for the rest of the 30 minute.",
            "Just be sure the right one good, so today's presentation is a little bit about what are we doing with the cloud.",

            "The first one is public cloud.",
            "And that's more or less what we all know that's the Internet.",
            "So someone is manageing something in.",
            "The cloud we are not aware of who it is, where it said he's doing all the management for you, using it, you're taking all the benefits out of it.",
            "Good example is here some technology from Microsoft.",
            "When you use an email system or from Google the email system you don't know where it is, you're just using it.",
            "You don't pay for it, it's just for free.",
            "That's a public cloud.",
            "And then on the other side we have something we just called private cloud.",
            "Which means you are more or less doing the same stuff as in the Internet, but it's totally under your control.",
            "You are owning it.",
            "You are responsible for it.",
            "You are responsible for the uptime you are responsible for the management.",
            "It's about virtualization.",
            "It's about managing servers.",
            "It's about building data center, so it will cost you a lot of money.",
            "But it's totally under your control.",
            "It's your privacy.",
            "Nobody else has access to it except you grant them access, but it's yours.",
            "And then what we see more and more.",
            "It's coming that both coming together that we have hybrid environments.",
            "You are using parts of the public cloud combined with the private cloud.",
            "So some stuff will be under your control.",
            "As an example, when we discuss with government a lot, they said we need to have our data.",
            "Based on the law regulation we have in the country in the country, we cannot move them out.",
            "It's important for us.",
            "We need to take care about it, but on the other hand we would like to use the benefits of the public cloud.",
            "So building a private cloud for the data for the security area, but then open it to the public cloud to get benefits from the services you can get there.",
            "And when talking about that, we also identifying that's not from us, it's from US from the government there.",
            "Three different layers of how you can use cloud and let us start with the bottom.",
            "It's the infrastructure, just you are just using infrastructure in the cloud.",
            "That means you are using hardware, machines, virtual machines, nothing else.",
            "But they are fully under your control from a management perspective, but the hardware is sitting.",
            "You don't know.",
            "That's something Amazon is offering.",
            "We will offer that as well.",
            "VM Ware is going that direction.",
            "Offering virtual machines in the cloud.",
            "There are the typical infrastructure approach.",
            "You're getting hardware, nothing else.",
            "The next level is that you get a platform.",
            "Which means all the management you are doing.",
            "Normally it's hidden because you're getting a platform where you can build your solution on top of it.",
            "Nothing else.",
            "It's a development environment.",
            "Some partners doing it, some customer doing it, building their own solution on top of it.",
            "Just getting an API like compared with the Windows 32 API or Windows API or whatever API you're thinking about.",
            "And then you start building your application on top of it.",
            "Everything below that.",
            "Is not under your control is managed by the hoster.",
            "Let me say it in this way and then last level we are going for is that you get software as a service.",
            "You are getting solution as a service.",
            "That's the area when we talk about an email system or CRM system or whatever you can think about.",
            "That's the next level of.",
            "Where you just get the solution where you don't do any management below anymore, you're just manage in your solution.",

        [
            "Whoops, here it was and why should you do that?",
            "On one hand, there are a couple of benefits in from an economic perspective, number one is really.",
            "You pay only for what you use it.",
            "We have a lot of customers who have built their own data center, have a lot of hardware in the data center just for one peak in the month when they're doing their financial analyst as an example, the rest of the time the data center is not really used.",
            "Maybe Cloud is 1 approach to change this behavior.",
            "It's about the cost, predictable and lower costs.",
            "Becausw Justin.",
            "As an example, we are building County data set or have already built data centers around the world.",
            "So three in US and three out of outside of US.",
            "And we are adding per months to each of these data centers, around 10,000 servers per month each data center.",
            "I believe you can guess that we get a cheaper price for buying these hardware.",
            "Then you will get.",
            "And it's more standardized hardware we're using here.",
            "Just to lower prize and making cost more predictable, you also shifting shifting costs from a cap ex to an OpEx model.",
            "So which makes a lot of sense for you.",
            "You don't have all the upfront investment anymore when you go into the cloud, you pay on the base what you use or you have a monthly fee, but you don't have all the upfront costs anymore.",
            "When going to the management level.",
            "We have a lot of stuff going here and there will only point to some of them.",
            "Number one is.",
            "Development makes life really easier.",
            "'cause you always get the newest version.",
            "Because somebody else is taking care about it, not you, not your IT department anymore.",
            "You don't have to think about the role the deployment plan from a physical perspective.",
            "Sure, you need to start thinking about how to train your people that you can really use everything.",
            "But from a pure technical perspective, we will do the deployment or the cloud will do the deployment.",
            "Whoever is that they offer.",
            "Reliability and fault tolerance has set.",
            "It's not only Microsoft.",
            "Also Google and Amazon doing it the same way alot of datacenters outside.",
            "You can switch between the data center if something happened and you as a customer don't realize that anymore.",
            "That's a fault tolerance which is built in when you use cloud services.",
            "And last but not least, is also the productivity enhancement you can get.",
            "It's the latest software for user, so we had a nice discussion before because I gotta wake up call from my wife yesterday she sent me an email saying, yeah, we're just updating our software so you cannot reach me and I was wondering what kind of software she will get.",
            "She is working for the public sector in Munich and guess they got an update to Office 2003 yesterday.",
            "I was impressed to be honest, because at home she's working with Office 2010 and she used all the new features and now she's going to work and she got Office 23.",

            "She were not able to do any work just because of that update.",
            "So I need to talk to these guys to be honest so.",
            "Will be fun, but that's the point.",
            "And also when you go to the cloud and use cloud software you have access from anywhere.",
            "If you want.",
