            "OK, So what is the option of that?",
            "The option is that there is an immense amount of 3D information that is coming our way, and so there's going to be a need to interpret it.",
            "So if your business is selling glass.",
            "You may have an interest in knowing how many square meters of windows are there in the city of Berlin, because you want to have a ballpark figure of what your business might be if you move to billing so the data is growing, it is at that time we don't have today the ability to understand 3D at the scale with which we are able to understand, for example, text to solve.",

            "So most of you, I suppose, are working in software, but your software runs on some hardware and hardware is itself evolving in various ways.",
            "So the question then is.",
            "What kind of hardware evolution has or can be shown to have or can be made to have an impact on your data analytics capability.",

            "So how do you manage to allow for these optimizations for these optimizations to also be easy to program?",

            "Positive externality is a situation where I do things that I don't necessarily mean to do, but end up benefiting something.",
            "So what are what are the positive and negative externalities that we as Europe should care about?",
            "So we talked about some of them in the process of yesterday's presentation.",
            "So sometimes you have organizations that have a specific object of their business, but in the process of carrying out their business, they also produce data they don't necessarily need for themselves that could be used for somebody else.",
            "So if you are a florist, for example, your job is to sell Flowers and move them from your shop to the person who is ordered the Flowers.",
            "But in the process of doing so, perhaps you have a delivery van that is fitted with sensors that collects information about traffic or other things that are happening in the city.",
            "So you need these data to optimize your flower delivery operations, but somebody else might also be interested in those data and use them for purposes that you don't even know about.",

            "At whatever condition you choose, you can be generous and decide to share your data for free.",
            "You could decide that the data that you collect in the process of delivering Flowers is actually a new product that you're also selling that somehow amortizes the costs of your flower delivery.",

            "So we are asking for your help to help us identify what are the win win situations where.",

            "Of negative externalities, so this has to do, and again we talked about this yesterday a little bit.",
            "This has to do with the what happens when so much data become available that certain inferences can be made about individuals.",
            "So there is a very famous result that shows that in the United States, 87% of the residents of the United States.",
            "Can be uniquely identified by their date of birth by the ZIP code and by the agenda.",
            "So what that means is that if you have a database and you anonymize it and you just give me a list of records about individuals that contains those three bits of information, there is an 87% chance that I will be able to re identify those individuals.",
            "Now, if you think about it.",
            "The more data becomes available, the easier it is to re identify individuals, because it's like a puzzle, so the more pieces of the puzzle are already in place, the easier it becomes to identify where to place the remaining pieces.",

            "Where a number of actors are collectively generating a potentially dangerous situation without any one of them being individually responsible for the final result.",
            "So this is a really serious problem, and again this is the stage where we have no solution to indicate an it's important.",
            "However, there we start reflecting on this in a rather structure memory, so if you have if you are an economist.",
            "Tagra for or anyone who has any idea to propose on how to even conceptualize and investigate this problem, we want to hear from you.",
            "We would like to hear a proposal on what kind of properties should be studied in order for us to address this particular problem, so repeating.",
