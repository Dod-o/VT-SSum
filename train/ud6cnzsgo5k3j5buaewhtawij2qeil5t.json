            "They just can't.",
            "However, having a method that could accurately label images with words, several applications in practice, one of which most of you probably use most every day, which is image search.",
            "So for example, you can go to Google and search for images of dog and you get back a lot of images of dogs.",
            "Now the problem is that there's no computer program out there that can tell you whether an arbitrary image from the web contains the dog or not.",
            "So the way image search has typically works.",
            "Typically work is by using filenames and HTML text, so if you search for dog, you go back a lot of images, name dog dot JPG.",
            "The problem with this method is that it doesn't always work very well because there's just no reason for somebody to name their image appropriately.",
            "So what I did is I made a game that millions of people played it in total, about 10 million people played this game.",
            "It was a super fun game.",
            "Some people played it more than 40 hours a week, but the idea of the game is that as people were playing it, they were also as a side effect, labeling images to improve image search and the way this game worked is it was a two player game.",
            "So whenever you went to the website you get.",
            "You got randomly paired with somebody else wanting to play the game, so it was you and a total stranger.",
            "You are not allowed to communicate, and the goal of the game is for both you and your partner, who was a total stranger to type the exact same thing, giving that the only thing you two had in common is that you could both see the same image.",
            "OK, so you could both be the same image you knew you could both be the same image and now you were told type whatever the other guys typing.",
            "It turns out that what people did was type a lot of words related to the common image, and so basically both players were typing a lot of words related to the common image until one player ones words was equal to 1 player 2's words, they agreed that was the goal of the game and they got points.",
            "And this word that two players agreed on was a really good label for the image because it came from 2 independent sources or relatively independent sources.",
            "So that was the way this game worked, about 2004 ish.",
            "Google actually bought the game and then they use that to improve Google Image Search.",
            "So now Google Image search is better because of millions of people playing this game.",

        [
            "Second project that I worked on in human computation was this project that most of you have probably have been annoyed by.",
            "It's this thing.",
            "How many of you find captures annoying, so capture, you've seen all these.",
            "OK, thank you good.",
            "OK so I was one of the people who invented those.",
            "So that thing is called a capture.",
            "If you don't know the reason is there to make sure that you would the entity filling out the form is actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was written to submit the form millions of times.",
            "And the reason it works is because humans at least some humans, maybe not part with some humans can read these distorted characters, but computer programs can do it as well, yet so this is a security mechanism.",
            "For example, the reason is used in Ticketmaster is to make sure that you, the entity filling out the form, are actually not scalper, who wrote a program to buy millions of tickets.",
            "Now at some point in about 2005 2006 we did a little calculation about a back of the envelope calculation about how many of these captures were typed every day by people around the world.",
            "And it turns out that number is about 200 million to about 200 million times a day.",
            "Somebody types of capture throughout the world.",

            "I thought look at the impact that my research has had.",
            "But then I started feeling bad because The thing is, each time you type one of these, essentially, not only is it super annoying, but also you waste about 10 seconds of your time.",
            "And if you multiply that by 200 million, you get the humanity as a whole is wasting about 500,000 hours.",
            "Everyday typing these annoying captions.",
            "So then I started feeling bad and then I started thinking, is there any way in which we can use this effort for something that is good for humanity an The thing is, see while you're typing those captures, your brain is doing something amazing.",
            "Your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do very well.",
            "So can we get you to do something useful?",
            "And the answer to that is yes, and this is what we're doing now with recaptcha.",
            "That's the next project that I worked on.",
            "The idea with recaptcha is that while you're typing one of these, not only are you authenticating yourself as a human, but also you're helping us to digitize books.",
            "So let me explain that very briefly in case you haven't heard about this.",
            "So the idea is there's a lot of projects out there trying to digitize books, so Google for example is trying to digitize books on the Internet archives, trying to digitize books in the way it works is you take an old book like a thing you've seen those things like a book.",
            "OK, so you take one of those things and you.",
            "Scan it, but scanning it is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book.",
            "It's just scanning a book is taking a picture of every page of the book.",
            "The next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to decipher all of the words in that picture.",
            "That's done using a technology called OCR for optical character recognition.",
            "The problem with OCR is that it's not perfect, especially for all their books for things that were in more than 50 years ago, the computer cannot recognize about 30% of the words.",
            "So what we're doing is we're taking all the words that the computer cannot recognize, and we're getting people to read them for us while they type captures on the Internet.",
            "OK, so these words that you're typing are actually words that are coming directly from books that are being digitized that the computer cannot recognize.",
            "And the reason there are two words now instead of just one is that C, for one of the words is 1, for which we are much more confident about.",
            "We pretty much know the answer for that one.",
            "That's the one that we used to figure out.",
            "Whether you're human and then the other one is a brand new one that we don't have very much confidence about it.",
            "We don't tell you which ones which, and we say please type both.",
            "And if you type the correct one for which the one for which we know the answer, we assume you're human.",
            "And then we also get some confidence that you type the other word correctly.",
            "It's the basic idea of recaptcha using this method we are digitizing about 100 million words today, which is the equivalent of about 2 million books a year.",
            "Or being done just one word at a time by just having people type caps on the Internet?",
            "Now, since we're doing so many words, funny things can happen, and this is especially true because now we're giving people two randomly chosen English words next to each other, so funny things can happen.",
