            "Thank you.",
            "So the greedy method of selecting essentially vantage point that you compare your method to seems to be taken into account only.",
            "The information that can be gained at that point is only information as opposed to information and cost of going there, right?",
            "But at the same time, what you're doing seems to be in at least in spirit SIM, somewhat similar to active learning where.",
            "Do you agree or less?",
            "It's definitely in the spirit.",
            "Yes, OK, yeah.",
            "So in active learning, one popular baseline is picking points.",
            "Training examples according to the ratio of information gain versus cost.",
            "So either the difference between the two, or the ratio between the two, and oftentimes it works really, really well for you know, there are some theoretical reasons for that, so I was wondering, did you compare your system to this method of picking points?",
            "If not, why not?",
            "I guess we didn't actually compare with the method that used the.",
            "Rachel, I think mostly because we were, we kept thinking about path link.",
            "This is kind of resource management, so we wanted to say deviation.",
            "I guess we kept thinking deviation from the shortest path is what we had as a cost.",
            "So you're right we we haven't traded, trained, tested against that extremely active learning approach.",
            "But it is.",
            "It is a good idea.",
            "We should do it.",
            "Just one question.",
            "Where do you get the initial hypothesis from?",
            "I mean in order to.",
            "Get those message points you need to have some idea in the beginning where those might be, yes, so that's actually a very interesting algorithmic, like how our algorithm actually works.",
            "We actually start out with no hypothesis, no objects, and then every time the optic detector fires, we create a new hypothesis where it tells us there potentially is 1, and then we have to solve the aliasing problem of like is a detector firing on the same hypothesis and then update the belief, or create a new one.",
            "So the hypothesis actually get created online as we run.",
            "Um?",
            "Does that answer?",
            "Yeah, that's fine.",
            "Yes, OK, we actually have run a little bit late, so maybe one last question if anyone feels like it.",
            "You mentioned occlusion is 1 particular example of a way in which an object could could be difficult to perceive.",
            "I'm wondering whether you thought about extending this to beyond just moving, but to more active tasks.",
            "For example, lifting up something or or lifting up a book to see what's underneath, and whether that would fit into your your scenario very easily.",
            "So there's definitely a lot of things we thought about extending, in particular with occlusion as a kind of a guiding point.",
            "Our planner does have kind of actions that it can take.",
            "It just only knows about motion right now.",
            "In order to have it pick up, we have to figure out exactly where the object is that we're picking up first.",
            "So there might be some mixing there which could be quite fun to workout.",
            "So yeah, I definitely think occlusion is one of the next steps that should be tackled, 'cause it is a big problem with object detectors is you expect there to be something, but there's really like something in front of you and you can if you can just move it or do something with it, you'll be fine, but.",
