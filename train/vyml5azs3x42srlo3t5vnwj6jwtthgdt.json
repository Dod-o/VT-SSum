            "Which ones are sort of movies, you know, jump in and just watch all your movies so you know any.",

            "You know that's that's in full force, and that's just on the initial search results page, and then you start off and you're getting all these fast experiences and everything like that.",
            "And then as you look into things like mobile again, the experiences are very different and are tailored, so I think we're already in a very transformative phase of user experience.",

            "I'd say so.",

            "Ann will be able to include it and use the same technologies or is used for everything else, then that's great.",

            "I mean, someone may not be making their content available through a search engine.",
            "And so you have to figure out the ways to work around all that.",

            "Go over several steps.",
            "What I mean is that you use this kind of relations also for question answering when you have a very complex questions that involve multiple entities like the one that just have been the example being like BMW and Mitzi this and what you would like to to find out a different kind of relations that may exist between them apart from this very generic relation like versus yeah I mean against the Sky is the limit so you know kind of the.",

            "OK, in a variety of different ways, then presented in different kinds of things.",

            "Kind of how diverse they are or not and we can talk more about it.",
