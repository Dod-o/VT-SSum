            "And then here and there just couldn't find it.",
            "Instead actually came to be in and then what I did is just simply type Delta airlines and what you can see on this on top of screen here that not only where to pull somebody use for that link so we call it deeply.",

            "Some of the things that people are often to use on Delta website and what's actually interesting.",
            "Interesting feature here is actually directly we have to put a customer service number here that I actually can just get it right away for the purpose of that.",
            "That was actually trying to solve an object.",
            "I validate that last night I did go to Delta Airlines aside and I really could not find it.",

            "But anyway, they haven't even seen your original 1.",
            "But what actually wanted to talk about here is actually if you see this one here, we actually have a.",
            "We called a enhanced movie results here that we actually show that sort of kind of what are the tasks when people search for movie, right?",
            "And you know, it's either people try to watch a movie or they want to buy or rent a movie, or they want to look at the related review of the movie to see what is good or not.",
            "And in my case, and obviously I'm going to have to rent.",
            "But then also, what's more important when I did this query was actually to see whether it's actually worth.",
            "And or not, and if I actually click on this here, it actually takes me to a result page.",
            "More kind of a more complete page that were actually has a bunch of summaries of this movie, including the image is an in somebody.",

            "Nancy is created an as well as.",
            "Disambiguated from multiple resources pulled together, you know, from Netflix, IMDb and these bunch of movie listing sources that kind of put that together on that, so this is actually something that we recently launched a couple months ago as a part of our four release last year.",

            "So one of one of the things that since this wisdom is about data data mining a web search so I can so well, they're kind of try to understand it more data mining details.",
            "And if I query data mining here then you can see there's a bunch of publications on data mining field and then on the left rail over here you can see that all these authors that's in the field of data mining and as well as the conferences and journals.",

            "There's a professor of Alatos who is a keynote speaker of this conference, this time, so actually well, actually, I want to kind of get into more detail about him, so if you if you click on that and you can see this actually a nice summary of his work and in terms of the publications and then sort of the citations that he has had and then somebody entity coauthors that who have written articles with him, and then somebody this G index and HTTP index information and such, and then.",
            "And the other thing is so actually I can show this here and there.",
            "Things we've actually click on the actually apologize this so I come back here.",
            "So if I click on the code that we have that we can actually see a very nice visual presentation of the Co author graph graph that he has with other authors that have.",

            "OK, so with that.",
            "And then the other feature when I want to talk about our economic sources that if we actually have this disambiguation function here, that were if you actually type, you know Michael Cohan here, that the reality is that they actually multiple Michael Cohen here.",
            "Then we actually did some entity integration work that we can actually give you an opportunity to actually select the ones that have it in mind.",
            "And then if you look at the Google's Google Scholar, they actually do not have this functionality, and they also don't have somebody nice ways of actually.",
            "Presenting summarizing some of the information that we have here.",
            "OK, so that's sort of kind of some of the things that I can help me, and then the other thing is that I'll come back here at one things.",

            "Actually, you know kind of understanding user intention there.",
            "We kind of use that information to present a more useful results to user and in this particular case that being actually knows I'm in Hong Kong.",
            "Please when I issue this query that was last night from hotel here so he actually know it actually knows I'm in Hong Kong so I didn't have to type fly from Hong Kong to Taipei and then see if you look at this here.",
