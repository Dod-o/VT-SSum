            "Out of curiosity, did you really get firefighters and police officers to write you entology?",

            "It's no question they do excellent work, but the communication is just because they learned it, and if they are asked to formalize it, they realize how many.",

            "What happens on the grounds is different from what is in the procedures.",
            "Yeah, or if you come across that as well, and then what comes into the ontology is the procedures what comes on the grounds is something completely different.",

            "So your system needs to model reality.",

            "And then you have something in between the and it's good again to have dulce because the deployment regulations are descriptions.",
            "They're not real world entities.",
            "And then you can have a real world entity like a fire brigade car with four people, and then you make a link and say, well, this commits sort of to what's written here in the deployment regulation, and if you give this to another organization then this organization there are OK.",
            "I know it should be this, but I expect only four men on the car and he can plan with this.",
            "So that's not trivial, but that's how the world works.",
            "So I just make one more question.",
            "So you talk a lot about ontologies in the talk.",
            "And yet many things occur to me that sound, for example this issue of saying in the car there has to be at least four people for example, and all of this cannot be so easily modelled in DL based ontology languages, so it's only more like rule space languages constraints.",
            "So this means that you use not just in politics, but you've also extended them with real space languages or how have you done this in the system.",
