            "So actually what we did is that we consider each sentence as an abstract.",

            "So for example, the version of 2012 in this case.",
            "OK, yeah, that's true, but not always true, because it depends because given that we we add the additional attacks.",
            "We may discover that other arguments in the graph cannot be accepted.",
            "OK, so they're actually contradicted due to the fact that they support or are supported by other arguments in the graph, and so that's why we need this kind of representation."

In fact, there is not an entailment relation, so it attacks.",
