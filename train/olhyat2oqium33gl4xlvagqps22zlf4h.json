            "Anne, this is really just to remind you that while maybe at the end of the day you might be encountering all sorts of vectors, and as a matter of fact we're not, and I will be talking about is doing all sorts of things in the Hilbert space, which is just a really fancy vector space.",
            "Usually you actually need to do something to get your problem into that shape.",
            "The other thing to think about is, well, what can you actually do with machine learning?",

            "Again, this list is by no means complete, it's just to give you a flavor, because quite often when you think machine learning, you think OK, well, it's telling apples from oranges, so its bond, reclassification on vectorial data.",
            "And this is really just a tiny tiny fragment of what you really can do.",
            "Um?",

            "Well, you will have something like 102 hundred different wavelengths in which you measure things.",

            "So they actually use a markup language.",

            "Um?",
            "The other thing is, some people might be willing to fill out parts of a form, but maybe on page five or six they get tired and they just send whatever they have.",

            "Probably not.",

            "I mean, the first thing he will do is.",

            "Simply because doing an MRI costs a lot more than just checking your heartbeat and your temperature.",
            "So you might actually not have all the information.",
            "In the first go, but you will get increasing information as you keep on measuring, but you still want to actually make a prediction.",
            "Another thing that might happen is that the data might be censored.",
            "So for instance.",
            "It might be that it's censored for reasons of data protection.",
            "So, especially with census data that's fairly common because.",

            "So they might not tell you more detailed information if the population density is lower than a certain threshold.",
            "Or they might not tell you certain combinations of attributes at all.",
            "OK, so incomplete data itself comes in lots of guises.",
            "Um?",
            "And you really need to take that into account in your algorithms.",
            "And basically there will be.",
            "A whole bunch of lectures which will help you with that.",
            "Especially the more Bayesian style lectures will do that well.",
            "How do you fix it?",
            "Well, yeah, as I said, lots of people will tell you probably how to do it here.",
