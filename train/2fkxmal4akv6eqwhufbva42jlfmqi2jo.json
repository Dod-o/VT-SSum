            "Why not model it as a plane?",
            "Well, so actually one thing we found in our data is that grasp these types of ground are they are quasi planar and if you reconstruct them with a set of planes you get a very sort of disjoint set of plain appearance.",
            "However, this is all very qualitative, so really another advantage which I should point out is not that we're not just getting a more accurate reconstruction, but we're also this segmentation into truly planar and non planar regions is useful in and of itself, and the grass is in fact not a planar surface, so this information can be used for many additional tasks such as identifying man made structures versus non net man made structures.",

            "Clustering approach and as well as I did not go into detail about the smoothness priors we use in stereo, but but those also enforce Multiview label consistency.",
            "Hi nice work, I just have a question about what part of your formulation may do feet one plane and for example parallel windows separate windows in one building.",
            "Because sort of spatial prior loan would not particularly help you there.",
            "Yes.",
            "OK so this kind of goes back to what I said about this plane clustering stage where if repeated planar structures are detected they can in fact be discovered to be part of our linked together to be.",
            "One consistent planar surface, and this is where this type of consistency would be enforced, but.",
