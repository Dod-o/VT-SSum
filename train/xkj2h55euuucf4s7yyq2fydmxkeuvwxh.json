            "Well, they took a user and they looked at their one hop neighborhood and then made it educated.",
            "Guess on the user's sexual orientation based on the sexual orientations of their friends.",
            "And you can imagine this works well for attributes like that.",
            "But there are other ones were used particular attributes where users may have multiple values or attributes where many users don't provide it.",
            "Where this approach sort of breaks down and so the natural thing to do is to not limit yourself to one hop neighborhoods, but look at two hop in three- for hot neighborhoods and the problem though, is that as you start, you including more users in configure as you start going, say three or four hops on the network, and exponential growth in the size of the group you're looking at, but more worrisome it's unclear what the relationship is between somebody who's three or four hops out to the user you're trying to infer, and for example, on sites like Facebook 4 hops, maybe a significant fraction of the network, and so we're actually taking alternate approach, which is instead of basing our algorithm on hop based counts.",
            "We're going to look for groupings of users in the network that tend to be more tightly connected, never sort of groups or communities in the network, and then try to infer based on the structure of the network, not based on hop count.",
            "And if you're familiar with Community detection literature, this essentially we're doing is we're looking for communities.",

            "There's nothing about the structure of the social network.",
            "When I say community, I'm actually meeting a group of users that's actually more densely connected then the overall network.",

        [
            "Network from Facebook and you can see a few communities in there.",

            "For New Orleans, there isn't a source of authoritative information that we could query, and so instead we did.",
            "Is we collected the Facebook profiles, so all of the information that users list about themselves, and from that we extracted attributes things like favorite movies, favorite books, political orientations, and so forth.",

            "So we're going to do now is take this data, and our hypothesis is that there will be groupings in the network that represent users who share a common attribute.",
            "So communities, the network defined by a common attribute.",

            "Or the groupings were assigning users to?",

            "If you're familiar with Community detection, there's a metric called modularity.",
            "Essentially, what it does is it given a graph and a division of that graph into communities, it tells you whether or not that's a good division, and if you don't know about, essentially we should take away is that it ranges between negative one and one where zero represents no more community structure that you expect in a random graph.",
            "So we use modularity to see whether attribute based communities exist."
        ],
        [
            "So I've shown on this slide is what happens if you look at the Rice University undergrads and you divide them based on major matriculation year or residential college.",
            "The way you should see is.",
            "For example, if you look at major but I've shown is the number of communities that result, their sizes and the resulting modularity.",
            "So for major, you see that there's almost no modularity.",
            "What that means is that Rice University undergrads don't form communities based on major of study.",
            "But if you look at matriculation year at residential college, you do see significant modularity.",
            "So what that says is there are communities in the network based on matriculation year in residential college.",
            "So there are attribute based communities.",

            "There are a number of other approaches have been proposed, but it turns out they haven't been evaluated on real world social networking data.",
            "And they weren't designed for running this sort of approach, and so I'll compare us to them.",
            "But it turns out that they didn't work so well, so we had to propose a new algorithm for defining a specific community.",
            "And to do that?"
        ],
        [
            "So we actually need a metric, and I apologize for having another metric, but essentially what we're doing is we're going to look at a local community and we're going to build it up by adding users until at some point we stop.",
            "So we need a way of rating.",
            "Is the local community we have good, or is it bad?",
            "So we've got some local community a here.",
            "We just want a way of rating its strength, so we're going to use is something called conductance, which is very simple.",
            "It's simply what fraction of ezlynx lie within a.",
            "It's very natural notion, meaning if you have lots of links, you're probably strong community.",
            "If you don't have lots of links within your community, you're probably a week community, but there's one problem with it, which is that that definition is biased towards large networks or large communities because as your network grows, you'd naturally expect that many links would lie within it, and So what we do is we normalize it by subtracting off what would be expected in a random graph with the same degree distribution.",
            "So what you get is a metric that ranges between negative one and one.",
            "Again, Rezero represents no more community structure than a random graph.",
