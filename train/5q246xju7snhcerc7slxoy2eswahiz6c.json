            "OK, so.",
            "As we said this morning, the goal of this panel is to say, well, we are all convinced that the machine learning can do something for robotics.",
            "And as young Peters pointed out.",
            "This afternoon there is the fact that sometimes the people from machine learning.",
            "I'm not that aware of the most urgent and anworth problems in the field of robotics, and inversely, it might be that people from robotics are not that aware of, say, the most effective and Dan knew which, not necessarily the same, but that they say the most effective techniques in in machine learning.",
            "So the point is, as we all know.",
            "Cognitive systems is the big keywords and we're all of all interested in cognitive systems, and so the point is that can we discuss altogether about a an agenda, research agenda, road map for the for machine learning for robotics?",
            "So we're all here to discuss.",
            "And of course, the people from the audience are welcome to to discuss and contribute ideas, of course.",
            "And then.",
            "I'll try to take notes.",
            "OK, I can say it so I I haven't really prepared so this one slide is from a from a talk you will hear on Thursday, but it has the same core message.",
            "I have at least four machine effort for robotics where the the general story in general is.",
            "Maybe it's time to reconsider AI to some extent.",
            "So like if you if you go back 4050 years people were saying we want to accomplish this and that and this and then if you look at where we are then we have at least two separated fields.",
            "So some people talk about the logical AI.",
            "And some people OK. And some people talk about the statistical AI and So what currently is going on, at least in the in the subfield, is trying to combine both of them, and sometimes you call that statistical relational learning.",
            "Some people called probabilistic logic learning, while what I would like to have Additionally is relational robotics, whatever that exactly means.",
            "So that doesn't mean that we have to go for logic proceeds also fine if you look at conditional random fields.",
            "If you look at MRF.",
            "And argue that these are relational systems as well, because the the graphical structure uses you're using.",
            "There are kind of expressing relations among random variables.",
            "So whatever we do, there is already a step towards the shipping.",
            "This general goal of getting the relations in then.",
            "So why do I feel this is important while the world is complex and we are all living in this relational world, I'm not only the relationships among people, although this will be part of that, but also the relations we have among places among objects.",
            "I mean objects are decomposed of smaller objects or smaller parts and you have relations or even I recicle relations among them like part of assembled of and so on.",
            "So statistical relational learning is one way of doing that.",
            "The hope there was, and I guess we have proven it in several domains already, that it's a natural domain modeling at least more natural than some other things.",
            "It's compact, it generalizes properties over different objects, and it has.",
            "This is the I think one thing which is shared by robotics.",
            "Headed pragmatic view on probabilistic logic, inconsistency and learning.",
            "So it's not like we want to give a probabilistic characterization of logic.",
            "I don't want to show, I mean like in robotics.",
            "We want to achieve something we want to do something so, but to make it a little bit more concrete.",
            "Here's yet another stone slide.",
            "Something we hope to work on an.",
            "I think it's not that knew the idea, but I guess we now have the techniques to realize that.",
            "So for example, generalization over actions so we all know the world is very complicated, but somehow we managed to do so, and grabbing a Cup is rather easy for us and I'm not pointing here to the problems.",
            "Young was already nicely discussing and what grabbing is and what grabbing is not is, but I would like to talk about this generalization of the concept of a cap.",
            "And if the cat has two handles or one handle or no handle, or five panels or whatever, you can imagine, or whether it's heavy or it is very light, at least if you use something like a relational representation, you get the tool to abstract.",
            "Depending on the context, maybe you're not interested in how many handles they are, but my rather on the weight.",
            "Depending on the other task, you may also just forget about the weight or the color, but you're interested in how many handles they are.",
            "So what we're proposing is something like a partial programming language that's.",
            "In the end, along the lines of Stuart Russell's idea, So what it means is you're not specifying completely deterministically.",
            "Each step to perform, but you leave some of these steps open, and these are choice statements.",
            "So whenever you come there, you can make a choice there.",
            "Now, of course, choices are typically probabilistic.",
            "I mean, it's not always good to select the same one, so there would be part of the learning to get these numbers in there.",
            "You can even imagine to learn these submodules as well, so we hope I mean.",
            "This is together with Coqueran worth hamburger and these people and we hope to realize that, but so the the main message is simply let's go away from a kind of flat representation flatlands robotics towards this rich relational object oriented robotics.",
            "That's my first statement.",
            "Any questions?",
            "Oh whatever you like, that's not my part.",
            "I'm on the relational side.",
            "No, I mean you can do what we were talking about.",
            "You can try to think about having a robot having no background knowledge and then it quit learning something by doing experiments as well.",
            "So combining learning and reasoning you can think of that you can just feel like you have primitives, so that's what we for example did that you have primitive for running around, or that a robot can move around, and then you try to generalize policies.",
            "Which you require in different scenarios and use the logic to generalize over these different situations and that works amazingly good.",
            "It actually works better than doing it with humans because humans forget about exceptions in a sense right?",
            "So they focus on the main part, but if you do it with machine learning you get also the the rare cases, right?",
            "So with robotics I feel everything which has a machine which can move or change or interact with the environment and rather pragmatic on that side.",
            "Yeah.",
            "You can view it that way sometimes.",
            "I like to say because maintaining a robot is very difficult.",
            "I ask for like to say ubiquitous computing as an intermediate step where you pick your favorite sensor and forget about all the problematic ones, and you stick for example, camera on your head and do something whatever.",
            "With that I'm very pragmatic on that thing.",
            "It's just the way you define it is one way and I like it here.",
            "Select men you guys have all seen my talk so you roughly know where I stand.",
            "I'm thinking of that.",
            "We have three layers in year.",
            "One layer is basically the execution.",
            "One is somewhere on the primitives.",
            "One is a context there.",
            "Think what Christian very rightly says is that we need to be somehow have.",
            "A lot of knowledge from 50 years of AI.",
            "And that knowledge is on a very, very discrete high level.",
            "Connecting this all the way down to the control level and this is an incredibly important.",
            "Probably the biggest challenge in Robotics takes all the way.",
            "Novartis Christian inside Ears to where they connect into the hierarchy?",
            "Well, I think they're just part of the context.",
            "They actually very smart way to formulate the context of how to select the right primitives in the right priorities.",
            "He's between them so.",
            "From that way, I would say we're looking at a very similar medallion here.",
            "The key part though, is closing this gap.",
            "We've done fun things on the control side and the lower level and the bottom upside.",
            "We've come very far.",
            "The other side is still the context side.",
            "Closing this gap between context and primitives.",
            "Yeah, it's a lot of goals.",
            "Research goals to be mined.",
            "And I can only encourage all of you to look here and exactly that area.",
            "That I would like to pass up.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Show my name did not show up there because I was entitled to this panel just a few days ago by Michelle.",
            "She did not ask for slides, but if you would have asked, should I have a slide?",
            "Her answer was immediate and suggested yes.",
            "And they prepared a couple things.",
            "One person in this room is very much higher prices of seeing me here, and that's myself because I am not have robot robotics people at all.",
            "I barely a machine learning person.",
            "I have sort of voice of myself as a theory of computing person.",
