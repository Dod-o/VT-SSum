            "That's right, I mean basically then just keep one you had fixed, scan for others.",
            "So basically anyone model interaction test where keyboard fixed, schedule, others have dependencies test because one of us resolve assembly.",
            "So if there's a new structure of dependencies between tests and I know it's early work was a little solutions for accounting for the effectiveness of tests that you can carry out.",

            "Naive Bonferroni factor an it's not never estimate is at 40%.",

            "Effective test I mean we have to be careful because the concept of number of effective tests is a proxy and, well, you know that better than I do, But that's so we have to be careful with that.",
            "But that seems to be the.",
            "Lot of things and I think that has to do with the fact that when we look at the interaction, yes we keep one.",
            "Maybe we can, we can keep one fixed.",
            "But it it goes in both dimensions and the decay is is an R-squared decay.",
            "In two dimensions, so it's very rapid, so the correlation is actually, I think a little loser then.",
            "Then we would have it in in univariate tests.",
