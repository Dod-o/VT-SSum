            "The program just didn't know what to care about.",
            "Unfortunately for us, not for your question, but for our methods.",
            "That's actually not the case.",
            "What the system was told is to be comprehensive.",
            "Take every sentence and squeeze as much juice out of it as you can.",
            "And then we looked at the results and we said, OK, to what extent do you have complete coverage of a domain?",
            "Like, do you really know everything that's to be known about apples?",
            "Have you picked up at least all the main fruit and do you know the basic facts about them?",
            "And the answer turns out to be no, and it's not because of lack of focus of attention, it's because that information isn't out there, at least relative to what we're able to extract.",
            "Even when you take such huge corpora of texts.",
            "So I think what it showed us is that we really need to get deeper into the text, and we need to augment those methods in a number of ways.",
            "It's there's some very real problems there.",
            "Even if I told it this is exactly what you ought to care, but it just wasn't recovering the information that we needed, and again, it's easy to obscure that with.",
            "You know, we're always so good at kind of shooting somewhere and then drawing a bullseye around that.",
            "So if you look at my previous paper, you know we all do this to some extent.",
            "You see these grade metrics like we learned, you know, literally billions of facts and a lot of them are correct.",
            "But then if you change the metric and you, say, look.",
            "Do you know what you need to know?",
            "Do you have a comprehensive knowledge of fruit?",
            "The answer is no.",
            "Do you have comprehensive knowledge that would be required to pass a fourth grade test, or even a second grade test?",
            "The answer is no, so again, that's that's the challenge.",
            "Thank you very much.",
            "Alright, take a question from this site.",
            "Yeah, I was wondering if you had other ideas about applying data mining and the technologies to the social good.",
            "I think that's and I appreciated your geopolitical humor.",
            "What other, what other?",
            "What other applications are you?",
            "Could you think of for?",
            "Doing good.",
            "Oh I, I think there's there's an infinite set I won't try to catalog them, I'll just mention, for example, the Arista work could lead to systems that would help in education.",
            "I think you know there's a lot of work in terms of I guess what I would say is really take any social problem.",
            "It leads to a set of challenges where we can help.",
            "So whether it's human trafficking and identifying images of people who are missing too.",
            "Preventing you know.",
            "There's a recent article about collision avoidance systems where you know cars are are talking to each other, vision being applied in driverless cars, and those are all built on top of data mining techniques, right?",
            "So the Sky's the limit is is the short answer.",
            "OK, over to the other side.",
            "Hi, I was wondering with the 4th grade test in the back of my mind I think a lot of people have hinted on this.",
            "Is that that's kinda boring 'cause we could do that.",
            "So I was wondering what kind of if you have an artificial thinking machine.",
            "What kinds of questions that we can answer that humans can answer?",
            "Would you want that machine to answer?",
            "Let me paraphrase the question and see if I get it right.",
            "Basically, you're saying look, that's all very nice and good that you're taking something that every 10 year old can do.",
            "What about having machines do things that people can't do?",
            "Wouldn't that be more useful?",
            "More exciting is that, yeah, yeah, and I think that there are lots of goals like that, but I was wondering which you're most excited and sure so so you're absolutely right.",
            "First of all, our goal really isn't, you know, to take.",
            "10 year olds and put them out of work or put them out of school or even to help them cheat on this test.",
            "You know, like bring their iPhone in and my iPhone can take this test.",
            "The test is a benchmark task and a forcing function to do more fundamental work.",
            "I believe that that kind of work on natural language understanding and analysis is required to do some of these other exciting achievements, but my real hope is that progress on that progress in terms of natural language in terms of knowledge and so on.",
            "In terms of getting semantics out of text would then allow us to do something like the Semantic Scholar project where we have a system that has a superhuman ability to keep up with publications to extract the key facts both out of the text and out of the tables and graphs, and what have you like.",
            "I was hinting at with the geometry and the diagrams and then being able to make that available to a human researcher or human patient.",
            "So now we see this super superhuman ability to deal with information.",
            "Overload and it's really getting to the point where no human can keep up.",
            "But then making that making that available as a tool to a person to make them more productive.",
            "That's really the vision that I'm most excited about.",
            "We have some very fundamental problems to solve to get there.",
            "Thanks alright.",
            "Thank you very, very provocative talker and switches are from Hopkins.",
            "So could you.",
            "So the grand goal you described of reasoning based systems is certainly very useful, and I'm glad I too is doing it.",
            "Can you breakdown based on your experience in this area in the last two decades?",
            "You know where are we?",
            "Where are the biggest gaps?",
            "So what I mean by that is even if you pick the example you choose, or should I eat this Apple or not?",
            "Is it the fact that we're not using the right kinds of data?",
            "Is it the fact that our representation is broken?",
            "Is it that we're not doing task focused AI, or the fact that our approach is entirely?",
            "Not right?",
            "That's a great question.",
            "Thank you.",
            "First of all, I would start to say that our approach is right.",
            "The technologies that we have and that have proven themselves in these limited tests are very productive.",
            "You know, you could argue an issue.",
            "We do more things based on unlabeled data.",
            "Should we do more things based on on graphs?",
            "I guess I would say that one issue that I do have is that we and that definitely includes me have been.",
            "Seduced by the big part of Big Data so well, if I can do this on, you know 10 to the six bits.",
            "Why don't I do tend to the 9th 10 to the 12, you know, etc.",
            "Let's let's work on PETA bytes when I'm working on that.",
            "Oh well, there's all these scaling problems, right?",
            "So scale up is great.",
            "You have to worry about what are you scaling up or you're scaling up the same old thing.",
            "There's still very hard problems in just three.",
            "Sentence is, as we find out, so I guess I would say if I had my hands on the knobs I would say maybe I would do a little bit less.",
            "On scaling things up to massive scales, I understand why you know Facebook and Google Twitter need that, but I think that for the kind of things I'm thinking about, you could do a little bit less.",
            "I think the knowledge representation and data mining have to come together much more strongly, right?",
            "So we do need to be a lot more ambitious in terms of what's the output that we demand of these systems.",
            "As I was saying, not just one bit distinctions, that's great for spam versus non spam.",
            "It's not great for building.",
            "Theories, so again I looked to Pedro stock yesterday, right?",
            "There's some exciting work being done.",
            "I want to see more of it.",
            "I want to see it going further and I want to see it being done in the context of common sense knowledge and then the one last thing I would emphasize is language is endlessly difficult and fascinating, but it's there.",
            "We can't avoid it.",
            "That's where a lot of the key knowledge is.",
            "So again, Johns Hopkins.",
            "Preaching to the choir, we have to invest more in being able to do even basic things like understand the question.",
            "OK, where are where are our state of the art systems for understanding questions?",
            "Not where they should be.",
            "Thanks, so just one follow-up comment.",
            "Sorry if you don't mind.",
            "I think the task you've chosen of understanding arithmetic to be able to answer multiple choice questions is a very nice one because the knowledge necessary to do it is pretty well codified, so part of it is, you know if Apple is sweet and it's not mentioned anywhere, it's hard to know is the issue that somebody should be writing it down, but at least all the basic tenants we know to be able to solve math problems have been written down over and over again to teach kids how to.",
            "Do map so if you could solve that then it becomes clear.",
            "Maybe the issue is more lack of available data are available knowledge, so I think it'll be interesting to see how you make progress on that.",
            "Thanks well thank you.",
            "Let me just respond to that quickly and we do actually have a paper on that effort coming out in MLP 2014.",
            "So when you take this arithmetic problem like you said, the reasoning here is trivial.",
            "Reduces to an equation of the form you know 15 -- 3 = X or something like that.",
            "But it turns out that making sense of the question is surprisingly tricky.",
            "'cause remember the question I gave before was about somebody giving pens to somebody else else, because I could have easily asked about collecting coins, assembling toy aircraft, eating cookies.",
            "So just in these really simple arithmetic questions is buried the need to understand at least lightweight semantics for every verb in English.",
            "I need to know what every verb in English is doing for the quantities of objects in the world in order to understand questions like that.",
            "So the work that we did, folks focused on verb categorization and taking every verb and mapping it to is it adding things, subtracting things, transferring things from one place to the other, and so very, very quickly we find that underneath these really simple tasks are hard.",
            "And actually, you know, hard text mining tasks.",
            "Go ahead.",
            "Hi I have a question regarding on the thing.",
            "So as I notice this presentation it looks like we'll have more focused on that machine.",
            "Understand our human knowledge base, but I wondering or already this is a challenging task but wondering how would that machine kind of simulate the innovation but human?",
            "So the well important thing that people can invent a lot of new things as we did in the 1000 years, especially in the recent 100.",
            "But saying that how the letter machine?",
            "Do those innovative stuff that create something we don't do not know and we do not kind of visible.",
            "See and how would kind of machine do that?",
            "Are we at a stage that we can still challenged by the fact that it's difficult to machine understand us?",
            "Or is there some areas that we can let the machine do most innovative stuff?",
            "Well, let me let me just take a part of your question and focus on that one really important thing is we build these techniques.",
            "Is not to fall into a straitjacket of pre existing taxonomies pre existing ontologies.",
            "First of all, whenever we do that, we find that they're not done right.",
            "And Secondly, then that doesn't allow us to go beyond what was there originally like you were saying into touted innovate so the kind of techniques that I've worked on, open information extraction, the kind of techniques working on at AI two can use.",
            "Ontologies can use existing terminology, but can go beyond them.",
            "There never locked into them, which I think is essential.",
            "I'm happy to talk to you more about this offline.",
            "Hi, first of all thank you very much for your talk.",
            "It's really interesting so I'm very interested in your audiometry problem.",
            "So as we know that if our human beings want to solve that problem, we need to actually combine several theories together.",
            "And it's not that simple.",
            "Labeling things that we now do in the machine learning part and also, as you mentioned, nowadays the Knowledge database is quite limited.",
            "So I'm really interested what will you do you know, could you talk a little bit about that one?",
            "Thank you.",
            "I'm sorry I didn't quite get the question, can you?",
            "Yeah, I'm very interested in your drawer metric program, right?",
            "So you said you want to solve it, solve that problem.",
            "But as we know we need to combine several theories together and today's knowledge database is very limited.",
            "So what are you plan going to do about that in in the geometry domain?",
            "Well, so our next step, right?",
            "Once we aligned the circles and the lines in the diagram.",
            "With with the text, so that's entity alignment.",
            "Our next step is to extract the set of logical statements from it, right?",
            "So again, natural language understanding, but over geometric statements.",
            "So line AB bisects line DE.",
            "Once we have that in a formal representation language, we can do two things.",
            "First of all, we can actually feed it to theorem provers and their geometry theorem provers out there that we've started playing with.",
            "The second thing is, there's fun things that you can do just reading off of the diagrams in the diagram, it turns out.",
            "That certain lines are roughly equal and they're drawn to scale, so we can also make inferences based on the diagram, and So what we're doing right now is getting statements from the text getting statements, quote unquote from the diagram, feeding them to theorem prover, and trying to prove that the answers are correct and we're literally getting our first results on this this month.",
            "OK, thank you very much.",
            "I am you mentioned a couple times about scholar Semantic Scholars Project an you mentioned in special about pub Med.",
            "I come from NCBI which builds and maintains pub Med and we do each one.",
            "Pub Med right and we do text mining research trying to improve permit.",
            "So for our own research we know that there are three kinds of users or pub Med.",
            "There are general public.",
            "There are scientists and there are doctors, so your vision or in your what you want to do.",
            "What's with your priority to help each other, 'cause each of them will have a different user needs, right?",
            "So first of all, since you're from Palmetto I should apologize about my critical remarks.",
            "It does.",
            "Provide a very valuable service, but at the same time as I think you know to in the research right.",
            "Users want want more.",
            "The place where we would start.",
            "But again, I'm not sure that's the best place to start is just we focus.",
            "We interviewed a bunch of researchers in neuroscience, medical researchers and they did have some challenging things to say about pub Med and it has.",
            "But they are not unique to pub Med.",
            "It has to do with the fact that when you're.",
            "Dealing with such a massive collection of highly technical data keyword search, which is basically what we're reduced to using.",
            "Yeah, maybe we have some tags, maybe we have a little bit of metadata, but it's basically keyword search isn't good enough, so I would say that the start is to be able to extract much more semantic structures from paper and from from academic papers.",
            "So think about information extraction as I described.",
            "It was a function from sentence.",
            "The database tuples think instead of a function that takes as input a paper or even a graph of connected papers and outputs a semantic theory of what's going on that's sufficiently high Fidelity to point you at particular papers, or even particular figures in the papers to show you what's going on.",
            "So our focus is on researchers an an enabling them to do more semantics and again, love to talk to you more afterwards about details should definitely talk a follow up and just quick comment so.",
            "We do some semantics scratching from primary articles an actually, and CBS has something called NCBI NCBI 2.0.",
            "It's a slow.",
            "Project, but it's moving towards semantics.",
            "That's great to hear.",
            "We're going to take the last question by David.",
            "Go ahead.",
            "So I agree that the engineering component is extremely difficult to execute in academia.",
            "Can you talk about how the open source software that you'll be releasing could perhaps bridge the gap between what academia is able to do now and what industry is able to accomplish?",
            "Seems like you're a fan of open source, and so am I, and obviously the more we're able to invest in that, the more right these are platforms that we can build going forward.",
            "What we found at AI two is we've looked at tools to build is that there are two different kinds, right?",
            "The kinds from that are done from students in universities, and often they don't have the time, the professionalism, the team.",
            "To to make those really ready for use and in industry again, that's that's typically not their focus.",
            "Even if they do release things to the public at AI 2 because we're a nonprofit that's actually part of our mission, so we're going to be releasing open source software that's very well engineered and exactly with the hope that you describe that there's no point in throwing a party and having nobody come.",
            "The idea is to identify the places where there's a huge need, and then to release and make it available to students.",
            "And so I do think there's a very real challenge, right?",
            "Particularly, these areas of that are high value, like search and data mining of the gap growing between what's happening inside very rich companies that are creating their research centers and doing incredibly cool stuff.",
            "But it's wrapped up and what you can do in academia?",
            "The good news is that some of these semantic problems there were starting to tackle don't require massive amounts of data and don't have immediate.",
            "Applicability to ad targeting or to selling, you know, to selling products better and so this is a place where we can make an impact and achieve this next wave, right?",
            "That's going to be the focus of KDD 10 years from now.",
