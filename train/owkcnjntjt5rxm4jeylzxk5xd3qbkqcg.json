            "Cabernet Sauvignon, as a type of wine.",
            "Yeah, you can just define that this is a subclass of a general wine, but this distinction actually between the more general and more specific class, respectively, is visible or is understandable just by humans through the usage of natural language labels, but not by machines as such.",
            "By defining just by connecting these two concepts via subclass relation, the only thing that a query engine or a reasoner will be able to infer out of it is that all instances of Cabernet Sauvignon are also instances of wine, but nothing more.",
            "You have to make the the semantics of Cabernet Sauvignon is such explicit by defining additional constraints by saying cabinets.",

            "Or you define the grounding of your probably more specific ontology to to these upper level concepts, which also gives you the advantage that by having this grounding you have the chance to or you have the opportunity to discover potential inconsistencies in your modeling because these upper level layers tend to be built by people who are very passionate about modeling and about.",

            "Two branches in the upper level ontology that are necessarily disjoint.",
            "Yeah, then for whatever reasons, when you define your mappings from your domain ontology to this upper layer, you find 2 classes that are not supposed to be disjoint.",
            "That one of them is classified as in the in the left branch and the other one in the right branch.",
