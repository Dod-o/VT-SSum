            "Well, that's going to be the prior.",
            "The prior probability that it's at position X times the probability of receiving that visual stimulus given the assumption that it's at position X times the probability of receiving this auditory stimulus.",
            "Under the assumption that it is at position X, and if we assume that discussion noise and vision and got some noise on addition and that for some magical reason, there's no priors.",
            "In this case, it takes on a particular form where we can say that the best solution that we could have, or the best way how we could combine what our vision the auditory system tells us, is to do a linear way in where we take what our visual system gives us, and we weigh it with the auditory variance divided by the sum of the two of them.",

            "So then people have tested these kinds of models in many different ways, and there's probably of the order.",
            "I mean, it has been tested in virtually any combination of two cues that you can possibly think of combining, including vision and audition, haptics, invasion, and haptics, in addition, timing tasks in many, many different tasks, and I just want to briefly food."

            "The only thing is they have to have a monitor where they have loud speakers so that they can make the auditory stimulus come from different directions, and then to make it so that people can't just rely on vision, they just blurred vision.",
            "So instead of showing you a dot they show you some kind of agoston big cloud.",

            "Quite a bit like that and then here comes the sound and you see that thing perfectly synchronous to one another and what they do is they match the size of this caution cloud so that vision is just as precise as addition, and then they use standard procedures to measure how precise vision is and how precise audition is so that they can well match it.",
