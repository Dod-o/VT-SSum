            "You don't generally want just an image of something detected you have.",
            "There's something you want to do with those detections, and really, in order to decide how you're going to measure the performance of your detecting system, you have to have some task in mind, otherwise the measures of performance are kind of meaningless.",

            "I'm really going to focus on three things, one of which is kind of traditional object detection.",
            "This is where you've actually got some picture of an identifiable identifiable object, such as a car, and you, for instance, want to find all of the cars in the image.",
            "Moving downward from math to things that are a bit less distinctive.",
            "There's also applications in super resolution microscopy which is commonly used in biology, and in this case the things you want to detect and now just rather featureless dots.",
            "So instead of being these nice objects with lots of texture and quite distinctive, now just featureless pots and detecting simple white spots in black background is harder than it sounds, especially if you really sort of pushed out as far as it can go and then moving down even further from that.",
            "Another form of detection is something like corner or interest point detection, and this isn't usually classed as the same kind of thing as object detection, but in some sense it certainly is, so you can consider corners essentially to be some kind of objects, but.",
