            "And so if we have this statistical data as I generalize it.",
            "Then you can compute these scores based on that.",

            "So the theoretical process is we wanted to get from the index.",
            "So we start with a query and we could map it to words.",
            "Maybe it's a N word query and then each word we apply it to the inverted index and get back the set of URLs and then we can just do either do an intersection of them or a union depending on if you assume it's or and for the query.",
            "So if the query were.",
            "MMDSS conference.",
            "Then we take all the pages that contain the first word, MMD SS, and then all the word pages that came.",
            "Second word conference and then put them together and we find the set that contains both of them.",

            "If you have an inverted index that's ordered.",
            "OK, people look completely confused.",
            "So the basic gist is that we take the query, split it into words and then get a set of pages that contain all of those words, or some of those words depending on what your objective is and the theory says that this result is relevant set, it's supposed to be the set of all the documents that you're going to eventually go in rank, so there may be a million web pages that contain them.",
            "You want to find the top 10 in the case of a typical web search engine, but this doesn't decide the ranking, it just decides what are the possible page."

            "Just to choose from.",
            "So now we get to something a little more interesting, ranking.",
            "And so from the original diagram, which I'm going to repeat after we understand all the components, we have this challenge of taking this relevant set and ending up with rank results.",
            "And so the ranking module tries to come up with a score based on information about each result, and so here we have really 2 pieces of information.",
            "We have the statistical data, you know where the words appeared, how frequently they appeared, and then we have something called a structural index, and so one possible scoring function could be to combine a score based on the content or the statistical data, plus the popularity score or link based information.",
            "So somehow through magic not described yet, this structural index can produce information that tells you PMJ is very popular in Page B isn't.",
            "So maybe you know the home page of the organization is very popular, but something 10 pages down on that site is less popular and so the theoretical scoring function would consider the popularity of the page when doing the ranking, and so the structural index, which I haven't described how it where it comes from yet.",
            "It can help to give you an indication of the popularity and the statistical data.",
            "You know the keywords appear in the title or they appear five times, can be used to help figure out or estimate the content score.",
            "So OK, again, we're going to go into much more detail.",
            "I have like 20 slides about ranking and relevance, but this is just a very simplistic theory.",

        [
            "OK, So what would I not talk about yet?",
            "For the theory we're just going to kind of handwave around some of these because there's a lot of detail that could be in here that I don't want to spend the time on the low level detail at the moment, but one thing to consider is that we have this crawler that tries to find URLs.",
            "Where does it get these URLs from?",
            "There just appear out of nowhere, so the crawler needs some way to find the URLs and so the good news is if you take one web page you've already found, you can then extract the URLs and use that.",
            "To help the source or a seed for the crawler, the other thing is that I talked about a little bit.",
            "There are these indexes other than the content index, so the content index you can build by inverting the words on the page is the URLs in the words.",
            "But the structural index I didn't talk much about and that can be built by just looking at this web graph and processing it.",
            "We can skip over that for the moment, there's just a piece that's important to understand and then the other big questions is, well, how do we actually calculate this content score so I.",
            "Wave my hands and said, there's these things called content statistics in Word statistics.",
            "So how do we actually go from there to a score?",
            "And The funny thing is, that's not that's not highly relevant at the moment, but we're going to talk a lot about that later.",
            "And then another thing is, a lot of people forget is that there's a lot of UI issues for a search engine, so if we actually look at a real search engine, have a nice screenshot in a few slides.",
            "User Interface matters a lot, and if you have a bad user interface.",
            "Then no matter how relevant your stuff is, users won't be able to find it, and so even though the theory doesn't talk much about, it's actually very important to think about OK."

            "So.",
            "To see that we're all experts on this, we're going to go and look at this again and see if we can understand the flow of what happens.",
            "OK, so we have this offline process, which here this sort of query independent process.",
            "So before there's even a query, there's the web, and this crawler module takes the content from the web.",
            "Stores it in a page repository, so it's just a temporary storage, then this indexing module will take this data from the page repository and produce several indexes.",
            "It produces the content Index, which is this invert mapping, inverse mapping of words to pages.",
            "It produces a structure index, which is sort of this web graph that can be used for computing popularity scores or page rank.",
            "And then if you look at the book, it talks about a special purpose index which contains things that might be useful for the crawler.",
            "Or for other things that we don't need to focus on at the moment.",
            "Now this information is used in several ways.",
            "One is you can feed back to the crawler module to give it URL stats and directions, and the next is that these calculated indexes are used at query time so a user comes in and there's a query.",
            "The index is consulted and says OK.",
            "Here's all the pages that contain all of these words.",
            "Then that information is sent to the ranking module, which looks at the statistics of those.",
            "And the page rank from the Special Purpose Index and then re ranks those results.",
            "OK, so how many people think they're now an expert on web search?",
            "Raise your hand.",
            "Alright, cool we're all experts right?",
            "The unfortunate thing is, is that the theory doesn't really work.",

            "And by the way, the diagram is actually very good, so I don't want to say that the diagram is wrong.",
            "But if you think of the components just a simple theoretical components is not going to work, so I'm not trying to bash the book, I'm just trying to say that to understand what real search engines do requires a lot more than just looking at a crawler is simply saying I give a URL and I get content right?",
            "That that's so simplistic and a real search engine of big large scale search engine has maybe 50 researchers trying to make the crawler work.",
