            "Love your socks equations are you might find it in different variations depending on the application.",
            "There are ones, the ones that apply for a compressible flow and so on.",

            "You cannot solve them analytically.",
            "Except for very few examples of very simplified flows, laminar flows not turbulent flows, so the only chance we have is either to measure what is happening in the flow field or to simulate it.",

            "For the rotating machinery, again, the rotation is being is being implemented as a special rotation source inside the momentum equations and so on.",

            "Which is the powerful one and then.",

            "These two is transport in space.",
            "This is transport in time.",
            "OK, so you transpose something in space because you have differences of this transported variable.",
            "So if there is difference in temperature we have heat transfer.",
            "If there is difference in pressure, we have fluid flow.",
            "If there is difference in voltage we have current electric current.",
            "So this is most of them are diffusion.",
            "Mechanisms so, in heat transfer diffusion is hit code activity.",
            "Therefore yellow in the momentum equations.",
            "This is the viscosity term.",
            "It gives you what is the effect when you have different velocities we have you have share right?",
            "And sharing is taking effect cause of a property called this costly.",
            "So the diffusion term in the momentum equation is a viscous term.",
            "The diffusion term is a second derivative term.",
            "The convection term is the first derivative term.",
            "This is the mathematical difference between these two, so we're likely in CFD becausw most phenomena can be described by this equation.",
            "This transport equation.",
            "So momentum, even continuity, is a very simplified form of this equation, and with the equation mass transferred in multiphase are very similar.",
            "So we are not going to create different algorithms, we have only one.",
            "Algorithm that can be applied to all these equations.",
            "So all you need to do is click inside fluent, which equations you want to activate and this will be solved in the background for you.",
            "Finally, we have also another term generation term.",
            "This is also a volumetric term.",
            "The transfer terms, convection and diffusion are surface.",
            "Tabs are self.",
            "These are surface integrals, which means that they are calculated at the surface.",
            "So we have sales.",
            "These two terms are being calculated inside the cell.",
            "There are, let's say, volumetric terms.",
            "These terms are not volumetric our boundary terms, they are calculated on the boundaries of its cell.",
            "So this balance, which is expressed by this equation.",
            "Basically says OK, I will take a volume and I will see what comes in and what comes out at least as these two terms.",
            "Because comes in and comes out.",
            "Happens at the boundaries and then I will also take into consideration what happens happens inside.",

            "You know it's an equation equation means balance of this physical mechanisms.",
            "The last one is not naturally is not there necessarily, it is there artificially.",
            "If we want to simplify the physics so the generation term can be for example the Coriolis term for momentum.",
            "So this is a physical term, but it can also be the heat load I was putting in this project from the machines.",
            "So this steam turbine is producing some hit.",
            "I can put these heaters generation term in my energy equation.",

            "No, because I'm not designing the steam turbine.",
            "I want to make sure that the whole inside where this steam turbine is operating is OK, so I don't need to do the all the physics.",
            "So this is generation term and there's a specific way to activate source them inside fluent.",
            "So we discretize that.",
            "This is the first discretization step.",
            "Then there are some algorithms.",

            "And this is where numerical analysis comes in and says OK, I will use the simple method for pressure, velocity coupling or I will use a first.",
            "Upwind scheme for convection or I will use the quick scheme for convection and so on, or I will use the second the central differencing scheme for diffusion.",

            "Then probably you're not going to get any result, So what results are you looking for?",
            "For example, are you looking for a pressure drop because you are designing some hydraulic equipment?",
            "And you need to tell your customer that OK, in order to use my equipment you need to have this pump because I'm going to cost you so many pascals in pressure.",

            "You need to.",
            "To know them before hand, because otherwise you will not be able to produce a good model, maybe because depending on the results you're looking for, you will need to regulate what is the computing power you're going to need, whether the physical models we are going to use that will be able to produce the results you're looking for and so on may be fluent, is not capable of doing that, you're looking for because it doesn't have any such capabilities.",

            "So here we have a mixed audience between students and academics and industrial users, and this is a different reply.",
            "Usually academic will say I want to accuracy because I'm doing research industry.",
            "People will say I do some, you know practical accuracy because anyway I'm working with plus minus 10% to any other calculations I'm doing, so there is no need to go for the top accuracy, because as you know the lowest accuracy will characterize the whole calculations.",
            "So if you are doing somewhere in the whole procedure at 10% error, this 10% error will go all the way through, so there's no need to do some 2%.",

            "This.",
            "Depends on the hardware.",
