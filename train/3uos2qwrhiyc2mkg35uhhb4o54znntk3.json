            "This theorem dates back to 1930, so 13, so it's about, well, almost 100 years old or so and.",
            "And at that time the areas in my talk slides in my introductory slide didn't exist at all, so this was part of topology.",
            "An important part of topology was combinatorial topology.",
            "That's where graph theory grown, grown up, and until quite maybe 50 years ago.",
            "This was where graph theory was, and today graph theory is an independent area with much different flavor and different tools and methods used.",
            "So, but still there are some topological.",

            "For instance, this is one of the most known theorems in graph theory.",
            "It speaks about when a graph is planar or I should better say when a graph is not planar, so it's a characterization, and it says that if you have a graph.",

            "Complete graph on five vertices and K33.",
            "If you subdivide edges, you get graphs which still don't have embeddings in the plane, so if you have something like this as a sub graph then of course the graph is not planar.",
            "Now the the essence of this theorem is that these these are the only obstructions you have to look for.",
            "So if you want to convince me that this graph here is not planar, you just find one of these subdivisions in it and that's it.",

            "This means that you draw edges as straight lines, like in this.",

            "They're not entirely straight, because the hand drawing doesn't achieve that.",
            "But you can imagine what the definition says, so.",
            "And even more is true.",
            "So once you, once you request an obvious condition, which comes quite naturally with the study of planar graphs about 3 connectivity, then you can get even stronger geometric results.",
            "So this is one of the classical theorems that if you have a 3 connected planar graph, then you can not only draw it in the plane with straight lines.",
            "But you can draw it so that every face is a convex Polygon.",
            "So every face is a convex Polygon and including the outer face, which is a compliment of the convex Polygon.",

            "Now you can of course you can replace 3 back K and then 2 by K -- 1.",
            "You'll get the notion of K connected graphs.",
            "And if you imagine so the graph is connected because by removing zero vertices it must be connected so the graph is doesn't have cut vertices because by removing just one vertex this must remain connected.",
            "And removing any two vertices must remain connected.",
            "So if you have a graph which.",
            "You can make disconnected by removing.",
            "Two vertices like this one.",
            "So you can remove these two vertices and the graph will disconnect into 3 connected pieces.",
            "So you see you cannot have a convex embedding of this graph.",
            "Here this phase is convex, but this one is not so and you can convince yourself easily that whatever else you do, you can't do it so.",
            "But if you don't have this anomaly, the graph in the graph is 3 connected and planar.",
            "Then you can always find a straight line embedding in the plane where all the faces are convex faces.",
            "Now that I'll get you a sketch of the proof, it's basically on this slide here, and it goes as follows.",
            "So it uses a combinatorial lemma.",
            "I'll just mention the basic.",
            "Version of it.",
            "So if you have a 3 connected graph.",
            "Then there is always an edge that you can contract.",
            "And the graph will still be 3 connected.",
            "Now, if you if you look at the graph which is planar drawn in the plane and now imagine your contract this edge, what does it mean?",
            "If you contract the edge, you shrink it right and then the two vertices become one and and this new vertex will have degree 1234 now.",
            "So now it could happen that the two vertices have a common neighbor like here in that case these two edges will collapse also to the single edge, so that's that's the definition of contraction for the purpose of this proof, so it's.",
            "So that's a contraction of an edge.",
            "And it's a theorem which I'm not going to prove, it's just pure graph theory theorem that there is always a contractible edge.",
            "So you can contract an edge and still be 3 connected.",
            "Now if you contract an edge in the graph was planar, it is still planar because you see if you have an embedding in a plane and then you contract this.",
            "Slowly you can keep the property of being drawn without being embedded, so so you keep planarity in this in this manner.",
            "So what you do is you have a graph, you contract an edge, you get G Contract East, you contract another edge, and then you can do it, and as long as you get 4 vertex graph the smallest 3 connected graph which is complete graph K 4.",
            "So basically.",
            "That's a combinatorial part which we not going to go into details, but if you believe that this is true, then this is easy to understand.",
            "Now how to get a convex drawing?",
            "You go backwards so or you go by induction.",
            "So by induction you can start here or and go all the way.",
            "Or you can start by inductive hypothesis you get a convex drawing of of a smaller graph G contractee.",
            "And.",
            "Let's look at the vertex which occur as the contraction of the edge.",
            "So this is this blue vertex in this example here.",
            "Now you see the embedding is.",
            "The embedding is convex, so all those four faces around this vertex are convex polygons.",
            "Now what you?",
            "What you have to think about is how I will draw this in a simplified version here.",
            "So this is this outer neighborhood of around the vertex.",
            "We had four.",
            "Four edges.",
            "Let me draw 5 for this example here.",
            "So just be a little bit different than there.",
            "So this is the contracted edge.",
            "The vertex corresponding to the contracted edge.",
            "Now when you UN contract so.",
            "So originally this was on edge.",
            "And these two vertices shared these five edges.",
            "And maybe, as I mentioned before, two of the edges.",
            "Were identified to the same vertex.",
            "Now you look.",
            "So these are the two vertices A&B.",
            "Now you look which of these edges?",
            "Are incident with A and which are incident with B.",
            "So let me point out.",
            "So let's say this one is incident with a this once incident with be.",

            "This one is incident with B and let's say this one is also incident with B.",

            "And then a A.",
            "And then a here.",
            "So here you see I'm in trouble, right?",
            "Now what you have to look at is, once you have a situation like this, you get one of the Kuratowski graphs.",
            "If the neighbors of A&B were of this form, so here we have a particular situation.",

            "Just keep those four.",
            "You see what's this graph?",
            "It's OK 3 three.",
            "So let me K33 has three vertices on the left and three vertices on the right.",
            "So let me say the left vertices will be red here in this, so this one.",

            "And vice versa.",

            "This were bigger faces maybe, so this is just a subdivision of K3.",
            "Three, so this case doesn't occur and it's another possibility is so if you don't have this interlacing so that you would have four neighbors labeled ABAB in interlaced order, then there is another situation.",
            "And that's easy.",
            "You can try to for an exercise.",
            "There will be 3 neighbors which will have both neighbors of A&B.",
            "So that's another possibility, and in this case.",
            "So this is neighbors of A and it's their neighbors of B.",
            "This graph it's a message drawing, but you see it's K5, right?",
            "Every vertex is adjacent to every other of.",
            "Among these five vertices indicated.",
            "Of course it's a subdivision of K5 in general.",
            "So this doesn't occur.",
            "That means that you have something like.",
            "Here you have two neighbors X&Y.",
            "So on this.",
            "Peripheral cycle you get 2 two neighbors X&Y.",
