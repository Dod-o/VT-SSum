            "Yeah, so this is this is the way that most of us get to these pages, particularly these pages that we just don't know the URLs off the top of our head and everybody who runs this query wants to get to the Microsoft Research homepage and it's listed 1st and we get to do all sorts of clever things with it too because we know that you want to go there so we can provide deep links.",

            "Did a survey where he popped up a browser and popped up in the middle of a query, a little window that said, are you intending to look for this particular for a particular website?",
