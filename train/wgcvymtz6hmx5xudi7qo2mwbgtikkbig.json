            "The regulatory environment still remains the key issues, so even though we have the customs procedures in place, there's no harmonization even in the EU, and in principle we have similar processes there still different country by country, and still it still is relatively difficult for people to implement a global process.",
            "We have of course the strong demand for my industry for this business process to be doable, not just regional, and so doing it in many countries in the EU is great, but if you cannot do it in Asia on yes it reduces to extend the value.",
            "So also one of the key messages that.",
            "As you look at effectively you I would also say you know what is happening.",
            "Global process global standards.",
            "The next one is that a change management in our industry is very difficult when you have people were handing freight, which is time sensitive where the customer expects 100% on time delivery within 12 hours or 24 hours, and you're proposing to them a new way of doing business.",
            "And this new app being businesses in anywhere in any way shape or form proceed as either trial or pilot or something new that is untested.",
            "It's extremely difficult, so you have this this gap when you're going from having finally business process and you have operating, which is electronic which you know works, but it's still the minority of the business and still knew and you need to get you need to get adoption by people who actually are asking you for something which is mature.",
            "Save you know, works 100% of the time.",
            "Bedding and bridging.",
            "That gap is where we are now and is definitely a challenge.",
            "So it's progressing.",
            "But you you can clearly see that you know some of the people you're working with, our pioneers and they will do it no matter what, because they won't be part of defining the industry and the rest of the industry players.",
            "We wait until day very serious as they mature and embedded in process.",
            "The the the next.",
            "The next thing I would say is that.",
            "I don't know how it is in surface plate for the average history investment in technology is.",
            "You know is is done, but there is not.",
            "There are not huge amounts of money that people have to investigate the convergence and we we we tend to find that there is a gap between what people want to do and what people actually can do.",
            "So when you talk to airlines or flip folders and they will tell you what they want.",
            "They want they want to dance.",
            "Actually, probably business functionality is they want to be able to use technologies in various ways.",
            "Check on phone, but when you then propose them something that they need to invest in, you realize that they have very little money investing.",
            "So one of the challenges is to be able to propose solutions that are really cost effective and that that appointment sure and that's understand, allow them to leverage plastic images.",
            "Let's start doing business progressively.",
            "So this is this is maybe a quick introduction to to our experience in terms of the scope of our project.",
            "We have 30 three airlines using effect for example.",
            "About 100 folders in 40 countries.",
            "The total volume are still below 1% of the global.",
            "After that documents, but we're aiming to achieve about 10% this year on the triangle.",
            "Is possible to be effective, so that's our goal and on this stranger at currently at 4% and we need to control them.",
            "So that's a quick introduction and it's free to ask me any questions later.",
            "Thank you very much.",
            "I feel everybody.",
            "Can understand what the pilots wanted to do, what you managed to do, an also which are which are the next challenges that are very related to today to the questions.",
            "So now I give the floor to Mr Silver.",
            "He's a demand manager at Christina Line, right here.",
            "Yesterday, the implementation projects that they have been still aligned, but today he will give some remarks on the on the questions and how.",
            "Are seen in his business.",
            "I think the question is all quite complicated or must say open.",
            "When I started this business for let's say six years ago.",
            "I looked at the shipping activities we had from the holistic way and.",
            "I wrote an image to myself is water and we have a simple traffic with pool going from one place to another.",
            "What should we provide our customers with to do this as efficient as possible?",
            "And as we saw the model yesterday, but we have these four actors with forwarders, terminals, shipping lines and Warriors as main main actors in this in this game.",
            "And I looked into it and I saw that every time afraid unit arrives support, they have a bunch of papers.",
            "This bond shall paper is kept by the driver and handed over to the store in the airport.",
            "Check in.",
            "And they had with and they go through everything valued to see that there are no dangerous goods and the OR if it's dangerous goods that is declared alright, etc.",
            "And then everything is clear.",
            "They checking this takes a lot of time of course, and then they put these papers in a box.",
            "Together, all the dangerous goods declarations in a box and they put that on the bridge on this shift and on this ship they unload this box and put the papers on a big table.",
            "To detect where the dangerousness is located on the ship.",
            "Matthew.",
            "And then you have the EMS codes.",
            "That's the emergency codes to to handle the dangerous goods in case of fire or whatever it is.",

            "Initially Shankaran together with ESP.",
            "Here when we discussed the Internet of Things that technologies like or inviting.",
            "And the question then was how can we utilize or inviting?",
            "And that question has been through this side of it because the information platform has to be there before you can utilize technology, you have to be able to distribute information and share information before you can utilize the technology.",
            "And regards the freight, I must say it's a big, potentially freight if we succeed in disputing this model to the business, and we also have to.",
            "Convince the business that this is abusive to the business, be cause the freight the freight businesses has a net marginal two 3%.",
            "And with those two 3% we have to reinvest in IT and I support.",
            "That is not funny.",
            "So that is a big challenge here.",
            "I mean, we do things to make money in the business.",
            "An often when we have discussions on the on the freight and with the with the Academy etc, we had a very helicopter view of everything and that it makes sense.",
            "But every investment has to make you pay back to the.",
            "To the company that makes the investment.",
            "In All in all stages.",
            "That's the trick.",

            "So.",
            "I think it's quite big gap between what is possible and what is impossible financially.",
