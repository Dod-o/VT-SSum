            "So if you want to try to try to discover what skills what the set of skills that.",
            "The students need to learn is and how those map to the existing instructional activities.",
            "This is something where completely unsupervised machine learning probably isn't the right tool, but very lightly supervised machine learning.",
            "So machine plus human collaboration to learn these skill models.",
            "Every time that I've seen somebody try this, they've wound up improving the skill model in the sense of being able to better predict students, student behavior, student performance in the future.",
            "So I would I would say that's one of the biggest immediate bang for the Buck is to try and learn one of these knowledge component.",

            "You just collect the data and you can even use that, right?",
            "It's not as valuable as being able to actually understand what the skills are, but you can use it for example for sequencing of activities, right?",
            "You don't give a student something that they're 100% likely to get right, or 100% likely to get.",

            "So I focused on learning from the sorts of features that you could easily record from from an online course, because I think that's where the real the real payoff is in machine learning, that's able to observe these surface features and get at much deeper properties of the students people do, of course do a lot of research where they spend a whole lot more effort trying to measure the deeper properties more directly right, and that sort of research, it's.",
            "It's much more difficult to conduct in a MC because you don't have as much time or as much control over the students as you would in a classroom or a lab setting, right?",
            "But I think that you know we don't want to just use the machine learning without verification, right?",
            "What we'd like to do is to be able to use the machine learning in the setting where it's useful, sorted out in the wild where you're recording this this somewhat poorer data and then go back and do the experiments in the classroom or in the lab.",
            "To check that students actually are learning the content in the way that the machine learning proposes that they are in order to have more confidence in the ability of machine learning to help us decompose the computer, give some example.",

            "So they they used machine learning to propose the hypothesis that we should split composed by addition into these different skills.",
            "But then they went back and verified by giving students content that was designed specifically to probe these these this more refined set of knowledge components.",
