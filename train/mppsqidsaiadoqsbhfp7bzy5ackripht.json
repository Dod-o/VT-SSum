            "One is a situation, it is something which can be described in positive and negative terms.",
            "So you have also to specify things which should not be present in order to characterize the situation.",
            "But this means that this may change from new information comes in and changes the situation that you already triggered too according to the first situation assessment, a set of actions.",
            "So they are the way to be executed.",
            "And now something happens which invalidates the original situation.",
            "So this makes it quite complicated and the other point is basically that the actions of course change.",

            "It does not complete it, so it's somewhere in between.",
            "And now the second complex action is initiated that collides with what you initially shape.",

            "We could propose one step, which can be done automatically because we can calculate, but if it's a more complex situation then we can either continue observing these situations or observing the situation in order to collect more material or more events in order to make a decision or to save the human in the loop.",

            "Is that in the last two minutes you have a increase in the number of injured people from the 50 percentage, and the foyer appearing to next places.",
            "So there is a critical situation and this is here the the main point how to detect when OK?",
            "How do you take 20 minutes to meditate conditions?",
            "What is critical now this is most critical for me, but for you it is already critical.",
            "An instant endless.",
            "It depends on the domain.",
            "It's not, it's not.",
            "Domain experts were already doing look, look this realistic use cases.",
            "We don't get local election, but this is a French given.",
            "The use case and they only can be giving people who are collecting this information in a really do know when should be should react so you get people who already have a kind of expertise which is obviously not complete.",
            "It sound but not complete.",
            "And what we can do with this is that we can work on the completeness.",
            "I completely agree with you if you be considered general case it's absolutely incredible you can.",
            "You cannot do it, but if you go in use case specific collaboration you will see that.",
            "Already people are doing.",
            "I mean now that is OK this unit for Kashima was there was a bad example of the management of this because it was it was a car chaos but you can imagine that there would be patterns of of behavior.",
            "There will be situated Association.",
            "OK so yeah.",
            "I agree, but this is exactly the challenge and then our assumption is if you cannot defensively came up our planet, we can process these events very very fastly.",
            "Then you can much more chances than than doing any other way of decision making.",
            "I'm still not convinced if your situation and context assessment approach.",
            "It's really powerful enough to cause situational context also complicates things.",
            "More to draw conclusions for actions from from then.",
            "It means that you really have to describe them in a very low granularity.",
            "Along many different dimensions.",
            "It does not.",
            "It is not sufficient to describe the situation with three of items, you have to check many other things, or to make sure that this is really a situation which allows you to do this action, and typically people do not have all these things in mind as that's what the AI guys called the frame problem to know what what things have to be considered in order to describe something as being a situation like this.",
            "Yeah, this is one thing how we are detecting the situation.",
            "That is a matter of how you define the complexity and patterns and the other thing is how you're reacting.",
            "And we are talking here about the system that recommends some actions that can be human.",
            "Show at least some experiences like system.",
            "So that kind of proposed 100 dimensional context description approach.",
            "Then it came down to 20 dimensions.",
            "I'm not sure where he is now.",
            "So it is really huge.",
            "Yeah, that's why.",
            "We're trying to cover part of it.",
            "That's where in a domain specific.",
            "Something on the same lines, but not so much on the modeling of all these dimensions is the issue.",
            "That was a typical approach, followed by expert systems back in the day before you were home, yeah?",
            "You should say one of the one of the issues that they found out is, you know they might have to get very nice systems.",
            "But problem was oh, there's this specific situation in which 100.",
            "Well, OK, let's fix it.",
            "And then we're spending one year just trying to fix because you have eaten the interdependencies within the rules, priorities become available.",
            "You have you have a big issue, so that could that could be one of the issues that happen.",
            "So on the one hand, having these low level data is very valuable and you can take any actions on the hand if you remain too close to these low level data then you run the risk of entering into creating these kind of expert system, which is a zillions of rules which you know we would like to avoid that yes.",
            "Solar hinting at this later on, that's why, at least at the formalism level we are trying to stay at more abstract actions and possibly have a pool of actions that can be meaningful specific times.",
            "And also this pool of actions can can acquire new actions even at runtime, and can be re evaluated.",
            "But of course the granularity of this can be can be huge.",
            "We're not claiming that this kind of healthcare system, so we're not really claiming that you can replace domain expert or whatever.",
            "By definition, you're just saying here that you can develop an Angel architecture which can process many many information and then help in the decision making, so we're not making automated decisions and what was actually hidden in holy studies.",
            "What is here new is really that we don't have this stick vocals.",
            "We don't care even business rules, but we are proposing is really loosely coupling between activities near the calculating the next activity on the flyer.",
            "So just imagine you have all flow which is able to step by step and you really don't know what is the next step with this infrastructure because you have all the time.",
            "Because we have a lot of information, you can calculate the next step.",
            "The next step in there and this is actually the main idea is a hidden in all these problems.",
            "We are now discussing, but this is this is something which is new if you will run into serious modeling problems.",
            "Reach 1.",
            "To keep the rules head consistent and complete.",
            "No rule says everything is a rule about your proposal.",
            "It makes it better rulers.",
            "Yeah, signing actions to the complex events dynamically.",
            "We can make the rules how you can associate.",
            "You can now a complex event pattern which has been executed and the action what to do on will be calculated in the real time though.",
            "So but you have something like an equal event condition action rule as a general pattern, which is the general condition.",
            "Station between the activities and then actions.",
            "You can say these are condition action rules yes, but then services then after delivery.",
            "What I understood from your presentation, I can manage immediately onto these accounts.",
            "Yeah, but we're talking about this on an abstract level.",
            "We're talking about abstract situations and abstract actions, and then we are performing this dynamic mapping between situation specialization and actions, so these are not take our rules at that point.",
            "So we're talking about dynamic mapping.",
            "They're talking about even conditioning and actions.",
