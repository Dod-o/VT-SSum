            "This is, of course, the case, but it's reliable in the sense that for the movements that we make, we get about the same performance.",

            "Namely the brain is changing.",
            "Now you ask if the model is changing.",
            "Yes, the fact that it doesn't perform well and you release it from the freezing, it is changing to adapt again.",

            "But of course we can use the previous days to start the day and you yes, and we have.",
            "Looked at this, it's doesn't change much because the activity is a bit different and it's learn so fast in 20 trials in one minute.",
            "It's very hard to quantify if it learns now in two tiles or in 20.",

            "Separate models for you mean going to the hand movement.",
            "We use the same, the same model.",

            "Absolutely, yes.",
