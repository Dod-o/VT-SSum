            "Whether it's textual information.",
            "Whether it's images, whether it's speech segments, whether it's structured information from databases around the world, ontological information from knowledge bases, and doing interesting things at the intersection of that being able to pull together these structures to find patterns to identify relationships that exist between them and to somehow make it useful both for Bloomberg clients but also.",
            "Through that journey, by identifying areas that are interesting and patterns that might be valuable.",
            "We've identified areas where there is the possibility of improvements for research work, where we might be able to do better science when we are informed by the kinds of decisions being made by engineers.",

            "The ability to learn structure right?",
