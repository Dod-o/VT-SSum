            "Of the two things, or you can incorporate priors and then the metrics should be so I don't know the other messages you were dealing with, so I don't know which is the effect or the behavior, but more like in our measures, if you incorporate the priors, basically we're doing the same, so we are telling the metrics in the Bayesian setting that you have a prior, so you need more data to disprove such prior, so more less you are telling.",
