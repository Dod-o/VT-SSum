            "A little bit broadly, why genes are important for the brain?",
            "Why are they unique and why is that of interest to us?",
            "Here?",
            "I'm starting with an image done by a Slovenian designer that was used for a paper that just came out this week and where we describe that in the brain the jeans that are expressed only in the brain are extremely long and.",
            "That is something that we have seen to be a common feature across vertebrate species, and we were struggling to understand why is this the case.",
            "And to actually put in a very simple way.",
            "The genes for ourselves are like raw footage for a director of a film is just the raw material to work with is not really the final product, and these different scenes have to be combined together in order to make a movie.",
            "So our cells are like a director that have to cut this raw footage together and combine it.",
            "And the brain seems to be the most demanding director in our body.",
            "It works with the jeans that have extremely long raw footage and then selects little pieces here and there and uses them.",
            "And it's really puzzling.",
            "Why does the brain needs so much material and in the end the product is the same as in other tissues?",
            "Maybe, but still it needs to start with a very very broad size.",
            "And to put it very simply, so this white line here is the gene.",
            "And this pieces here that are colored will be the pieces that will be selected and in different scenarios different pieces can be selected and this is what we call splicing.",

            "Esterase is a protein that does something in the neurons is important for these neurons or any other cell to function.",

            "On the other hand, the reason why I'm interested in neurons and why actually a huge field is interested in neurons is partly because it tells us about who we are, but also from the level of the way genes are expressed.",
            "The RNAs made neurons tend to be longer.",
            "Not only the genes are longer, but also the final product tends to be longer and then it's not the part that makes the proteins that is longer, but the part that doesn't make the proteins the part that is actually what we call non coding RNA where you have a lot of computation happening that will again decide when the protein is being made, where is it being made in response to which stimulus.",
            "And the other interesting bit that specifically happens in neurons is that these RNA molecules are actually transported along very long distances to parts of the neurons, where memories being encoded.",
            "So when neurons meet together, you create Contacts called Synapse.",
            "That's why also this meeting is called Synapse, and in this Contacts you have to.",
            "Process the information and decide where this contact will become stronger or weaker and is because of the RNA that is present locally at that process that you can make this decision where you can locally control whether certain protein will be made or not at a certain time point so you actually are now compared.",
            "Compartmentalizing this decision-making in the cell into lots of little portions, and RNA allows that to happen.",
