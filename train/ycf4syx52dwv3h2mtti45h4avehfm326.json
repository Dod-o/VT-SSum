            "Right do things like that so that you're not spending your time trying to figure out if code is finished running.",
            "Once you've got that done, see if you can get everything to run automatically, assuming that it's successful.",
            "For instance, a lot of schedulers such as you know, see PBS.",
            "There's a way that you can enforce really crude dependencies using Q sub.",
            "You can say run this job once this job is finished, and so even something like that, which is really simple and you can put in the script in a couple of minutes means that your jobs will run one after another until the end, and that two will save you.",
            "You know that time in that hassle of having to check to see if the job is finished before you can submit the next one.",
            "Once you've done that, the next challenge is to try to stretch, recover from common errors, and this is where it starts to be tricky to do it on your own because the workflow tool developers have been working on recovering from errors for a long time and really good at it, and so at that point I really kind of encourage you to use some of the tools that are already available rather than reinventing the wheel.",
            "Another guideline is to put all processing steps in the workflow, so sure, you're big computational jobs, but also if you have validation jobs you need to run.",

            "You mentioned a bit earlier on when you actually schedule it.",
            "You end up putting hard paths and things like that, and you know what's what's the level of of dynamic there, right?",
            "If you don't actually know where it's going to run 'cause it could run on three or four different places.",

            "Or does it have the flexibility to run?",
            "Honest, I hope so.",
            "So there is a functionality, for instance, in Pegasus called deferred planning, and so without means is you don't plan your job to run a certain resource until that job is available is ready to run and basically all the dependencies are satisfied, so you can make a decision at runtime where you want to run it and so that is in Pegasus kind of the way that supported where you set up through multiple resources and you just make it, you make a decision at runtime.",
            "I think different tools support what you're talking about.",
            "Also, where you can essentially use variables and other things to say OK. Let's let's put this in at runtime, as, say, an environment variable or something like that.",
            "Yeah.",

            "So there.",
            "I guess after someone using account to mine bitcoins, but regardless, they're a little paranoid about security as a result, and so they would not let us authenticate to the machine in any way other than using a one time password.",
            "One of those files.",
            "And obviously, if you're running a workflow, you don't want to have to sit there and wait for the workflow to be like, oh, I need your OTP again.",
            "We need your OTP again, right?",
            "That defeats the purpose of the automation, so we went back to the Pegasus Group and we said OK, we have this limitation.",
            "Is there something you can do to help us with that?",
            "And they said yes and basically they wrote a piece of software which plugs into the condo on our side.",
            "It's a long running daemons, we just start a demon on Titan.",
            "We've located with them, they're cool with it, started another login node which essentially starts up an SSH connection.",
            "To our submit host and then we can go back through it and we can submit jobs to tighten scheduler.",
            "So the Titan administration did absolutely nothing right.",

            "No piece of software to support us running our workflows on Titan so.",
            "There are multiple ways you can go about doing this, and different workflow tools require different suites of software to be installed, but a number of the developers have tried to put the burden kind of on you as the user because it's much easier to install software on your system than it is to convince.",
            "In HPC and man to install software recently.",
            "I've seen it right now, apart of warfare.",
            "We have like a different kind of programming models like Miss Parker Storm.",

            "So for example, in case of a spark or even the store, you need Congress Congress.",
            "If so, you can have a kind of more flow similar to our flow, so you have.",
            "Like a step doing some processing, another step between another processing and the data is coming through and different parts of the workflow or descript running in concurrency so worthless, like in my in my experience, was like a parasaur Sam and I think that burn as well.",
            "Another novel, Swift they don't have right now their facility to running and concurrency.",
            "Yeah, different workflow tools.",
            "Yeah, Pegasus, as you said, is more of kind of.",
            "Yeah first one.",
            "Yeah yeah kind of an iterative process so if you have something that life without this communist so different tools are better at that.",
            "So I think for example, I think Unicorn and Kepler are better at supporting more esoteric or exotic models for for running and that's an example of where if you have a specific requirement where you have your job and workflow looks a certain way and it's maybe less common, you'd want to take a look at the tools that are out there and pick a tool that supports you.",
            "Know that kind of kind of running.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Hang on, hang on a second.",
            "I think they want to record that yeah, want to put the questions.",
            "You mentioned that Texas has a function of checkpoint.",
            "So does my application has my own checkpoint functional paxes has.",
            "It has eight home tech points like do I need to, yeah so this is check pointing at the job level.",
            "So it's saying essentially it keeps track of which jobs succeeded in which jobs failed, so it's what is your checkpointing is inside the job, right?",
            "Your checkpointing, it like every thousand time steps or something like that.",
            "And so so this check putting it at the job level.",
            "So obviously if you have one large job that you're running, you might, you know, have your checkpointing in addition so that you can resume.",
            "But yeah, this checkpointing is at the job granularity.",
            "OK, thank you.",
            "So how does this interact with like the Battle of Gear batch system?",
            "Would you still need to have your own?",
            "You know batch scripts or does this kind of manage that for you?",
            "Yeah, so this this is that for you.",
            "So with Pegasus, right?",
            "Once you've written your description, you're good.",
            "The rest of the translation takes place on its own.",
            "So gram, for example, like the protocol that I mentioned that does the remote job submission, comes with scripts which take.",
            "The job description file that you had for Condor and translates it into PBS or LSF or SLURM or whatever language the batch scheduler is using so that translation is done for you.",
            "And there are.",
            "There are ways, and there are ways that you say you know, OK, this is how many nodes I want, but the idea is to abstract that away, right?",
            "The idea is that you say I want this many of nodes that I wanted for this long, but you don't have to know specifically how the scheduler you know what what syntax schedulers using and so part of the point of this is to abstract that away right?",
            "It's trying to the extent possible to mean that you use the same approach regardless of what system your code is actually executing on.",
            "So then as a follow up to that question, what about system specific variables like on our blue gene Q?",
            "If you want to do IO properly, you have to set a bunch of environment variables to make sure that you know the metadata server doesn't block you or anything like that.",
            "So you can set.",
            "There's a way that you can set.",
            "Certain variables on certain systems, so for instance, when you plan, you say you know I would like to run this code on Stampede and when you do that you Pegasus goes and looks up.",
            "You have essentially a catalog with information about like OK here Stampede specific variables that I need to settle on Stampede and there might also be true for other parameters right?",
            "You might be like, well I know that you know Stampede has 16 cores per node, but if I'm running blue waters is 32 cores per node and so maybe I need to say something different in in my file and so.",
            "You can specify system specific parameters.",
            "Anymore questions.",
            "Maybe I can ask now that I run around.",
            "I am in this business for quite a long time and I heard that you mentioned provenance, have you?",
            "I don't know if I specifically use the word today, but provenance is something that comes up a lot in.",
            "Workflows and running things yeah.",
            "Another question here what we so we were using in our tokamak modeling for.",
            "Long time Kepler similar flow workflows with multi codes running in cycles.",
            "So 10 levels of depth and so on.",
            "But what we've observed is that.",
            "People at the end need a dashboard.",
            "That's mostly that they can configure how it should look where when they are controlling so many things around and I haven't seen a workflow management system and or engine that works like this, so that's why we just developed one check, yeah, but can you just comment on this?",
            "Yeah, so Pegasus, for example, provides a dashboard for monitoring.",
            "Monitoring your workflows and seeing OK, I've got a bunch going on what stages are they all in at the same time.",
            "I know a couple of the other tools provide different names, but the same kind of thing where there's a monitoring system where you can see how everything is going.",
            "Now I know that often groups end up creating their own large groups because they have specific requirements about what they want it to look like or how they want it to be managed.",
            "But let me say this one is pretty good.",
            "It basically it's a it's a local website.",
            "Basically go to a web page and it shows you what's running and what's that is.",
            "What state everything is in.",
            "So there are some tools to do that.",
            "OK, thank you.",
            "I think one more.",
            "I think any more questions.",
            "We will continue with handles alright.",
