            "So that's one way to extend the distance.",
            "Idea and there may be other ideas, maybe using probabilities a better way to measure the distance or using some statistical cooccurrence of two keywords are appearing on the same webpage.",
            "To use some ensemble of such distance concepts together, I don't know, but this may be some ways to think about it.",
