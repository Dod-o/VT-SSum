            "Reap the fruits of your laborers yesterday and actually get to analyze the results.",
            "So who gets really excited when they have day to play with?",
            "I remember a guy already I love getting playing with data OK?",
            "So we're going to use this tool called paragraph, and as I mentioned yesterday, paragraph is really nice tool to learn for doing this kind of analysis, because it comes it's part of the tower package, but it's just it doesn't do any instrumentation or anything, it's just for analyzing these measurement files.",
            "And the thing about the Tao Group is they create Swiss army knives when they create tools.",
            "Their tools have so many options and functions and things you can do almost anything if you if you know the right options to pick, and so that's what we're going to do today.",
            "It just gives you a leg up on understanding how to go about using this tool to overcome the world that have energy barrier there, so you have something to work with and then you can use this not only with if you use cow to instrument code but also with Scorpio files.",
            "Cube files will show you that we did yesterday also with the HPC toolkit and other other instrument.",
            "Other codes that do this sort of measurement, instrumentation their outputs.",
            "Many of those you can.",
            "Actually analyze with parent process so it is a handy tool to know how to use and.",
            "So this is the outline here for what we're going to do today, so hopefully everyone now has para profit cube installed.",
            "You have these four P measurement files either from bridges that you did yesterday or downloaded from the wiki and also from the wiki you've downloaded.",
            "This Blue Waters measurement file.",
            "So now go ahead and fire up paragraph.",
            "And we're going to start digging right into that.",
            "So so run pair Prof. Get it, get it open there and so then I'm going to step you through these things were going to open this initial measurement file from store P. We're going to look at use paragraph to look at the time that was sent in in key functions in this natural benchmark code.",
            "So you have to look at the call path, give you a quick overview of.",
            "Well, will show you how to easily look at parallel load imbalance in your code.",
            "It will become very obvious and.",
            "In the paragraph tool.",
            "And then we're going to use this blue waters for pre measurement file to look at hardware counters and drive metrics.",
            "Anyone OK?",
            "So here's a pop quiz to wake us up and warning anyone, tell me why we are using blue waters to look at the hardware counters and not bridges.",
            "Stems from a comment I made yesterday.",
            "I see at least two people knew the answer there.",
            "So yes, yes, that's right.",
            "Bridges has as well and and you can't measure floating point operations per second on Haswell with the with the hardware counters.",
            "So next generation that should be addressed.",
            "But we waters haterz blue Waters has Amby Opteron, Interlagos chips and so we can measure fluid operations per second using happy there so that's why we use that to demonstrate that.",
            "OK so.",
            "So I'm just gonna go for this.",
            "Screen here I have it all set up and so you were running paragraph.",
            "Also.",
            "They fired up here, and so we're going to look at this.",
            "Open up this file so you just gonna go to file and open.",
            "And they're just select the child type so it's default is a parapro Patch bot profile that town generates.",
            "But if you click on this arrow and there's more than one way to do this and town paragraph, my automatically recognize the file, the type of file, but I just wanted to show you all the different types of things that you can use all the different types of outputs you can use with paragraph.",
            "So there's HPC toolkit.",
            "There's the cube format, which is what we're using today, so go ahead and click on two Q.",
            "And then you need to go in and select the file.",
            "It has something there by default.",
            "I happen to be in the directory I need for this, so you may have to poke around the directory where you downloaded this profile, but once you get there, just select it.",
            "Then once selecting hit OK there.",
            "OK so here is this default.",
            "Display that comes out when you open paragraph.",
            "And So what do you see here?",
            "You see all these colored bars?",
            "All these colored bars are function, different functions or regions of the code that have been defined either by your measurement system or by you directly and so.",
            "There's a lot of context here.",
            "If you hover your mouse over these different things.",
            "So if you hover over one of these bars that actually shows you the name, the function that you're looking at, the exclusive time it was sent there, the inclusive time.",
            "Remember when those are so exclusive time is time to spend within that first level of the function itself and the inclusive time is is time saying not only in that function for first level, but all the functions that cause after it all cell phones, all the child functions that are called there.",
            "Are included in that inclusive time, so all the time of the function.",
            "If it's a C program all the time, all the inclusive time, all the time of the execution would be under the main function in the inclusive kind of the main function would have the entire execution time of your code.",
            "And I'm just going to show you this right now, up here.",
            "You can actually so you can go to options and you can select what metric you want to display.",
            "So right now the default display metric on all the Windows is the exclusive time here, but you can make it inclusive time.",
            "Then this first function here is going to be.",
            "As we mentioned this to be made.",
            "So there's also you can right click on these things and get options and right click here and get options for these functions.",
            "So there's a lot of context stuff you can do there, so just want to show you that's a brief you can look at these options and we're going through some of these as we go through different aspects of analyzing this file, so we've got it up there.",
            "Hopefully we've got this.",
            "This main default view up with all these these things that together OK as I mentioned in the slides, for some reason that it calls her across labels process unknown.",
            "They said no zero mostly means process zero OK and then you have all the threads that are appropriately named.",
            "The node terminology so, but that's what it means.",
            "Those are processes and I just showed you that you can have this context sensitive help.",
            "OK, so now you see that you've got so this what you have here is the time or whatever parameter you've chosen for the metric.",
            "OK, right now it's inclusive time.",
            "I'm going to so we got an inclusive time.",
            "I'm going to switch back to exclusive times.",
            "And now if you want to display, so we've got all these different times, all these different functions of the entire execution, all the functions that made up the execution on a given thread.",
            "And of course this may vary.",
            "Of course, the call path may vary for a particular thread, particular thread 0 versus the other threads in the code, so these are not going to be the same.",
            "But if you want to kind of look at it overall average, then you can look at the mean right of all these different things.",
            "So if you left click on mean.",
            "Then that brings up this nice view of all of the functions and regions in your code.",
            "OK, so let's take a look at this for a second.",
            "So you can see right away where where it's spending the most time in this.",
            "In this particular code.",
            "OK, so so each function.",
            "So these are functions.",
            "Now here we get this funny line which what is that?",
            "It would tell me what that is?",
            "This third one dance.",
            "What what?",
            "What areas?",
            "What region of the code is?",
            "How is that really defined there?",
            "Does it?",
            "Does it look like to you?",
            "Someone from the open NP section of the course.",
            "It's always going to hazard a guess.",
            "Sorry, I initially saw the Scorpion thought that was some sort of like actual overhead from the use of or the source code.",
            "4 P was the tool that you use to instrument the code yesterday.",
            "That's why I initially thought that yeah, over here.",
            "So this right here, this right here is actually.",
            "So this is.",
            "This is the name of a file and this is a line in the file, so this is the source code OK, and so yes, it was that when instrumented the source code, it created an intermediate file and named it was for P, and that's the line in the file where this region starts.",
            "But does anyone recognize this little thing up here at the front?",
            "What is that?",
            "Yes, it open and Peter rectally.",
            "So what's 4 P did was automatically automatically instrument that open MP parallel region that were that do really that do that do region.",
            "OK, not the whole parallel using that but that do that open MP do loop.",
            "And was sectioned off for profiling, so here you get what you're seeing.",
            "Is the total amount of time spent in that particular open MP do so that's kind of nice.",
            "You get this automatic loop level instrumentation here that you didn't even ask for, but there it is and you can use that thing that's more peated and we can see that in paragraph, and you can define your own reasons as I mentioned with when you do the instrumentation like Christian 73 yesterday, you can define other regions you can give it other options and breakdown your code, however.",
            "It would be most useful to you, but this is something that happens by default.",
            "Is kind of nice if you have an open MP MPI code.",
            "Remember, is MPI is 8 MPI ranks and seven threads parent.",
            "OK, so so this is nice to see that a lot of times that there there's a lot going on.",
            "There's a lot to look at here.",
            "One thing to sort of realize the paragraph is that it will, for a given function, it will accumulate all the time in that in that specific function.",
            "But then it will also show you all of the time.",
            "I'm gonna do something here.",
            "You could follow me better if you go there.",
            "Preferences I like it to reverse the call pass and then it's easier to see what it's talking about.",
            "The same thing.",
            "So that was that was again file.",
            "Preferences.",
            "And then I'm going to click reverse call pass and this I think is a nice review when you have this and hit apply and.",
            "So then what this does is OK, it puts the function name last.",
            "So now it starts at the bottom of the call path and works its way back when you see these little errors here.",
            "This is the file path.",
            "And so here's this function that takes the most time, but you look down here.",
            "Here's a bunch of instances of that function, and they're all in difficult path.",
            "See.",
            "So this this this function was called from this wire source solved dot F. This this this OMP dude and wired source all dot F line 52.",
            "Solve an X_Solve OK, so three different places, at least.",
            "Well, this is called an.",
            "If you add these three things together, then you should get about that total.",
            "'cause this is the total is.",
            "Use it from any callback in that function.",
            "And here's a specific path, so this is really handy to know this, and then we see this you don't know.",
            "OK, what is instantiation of?",
            "That function is actually taking up so much time.",
            "Well, this with the contact information and you'll be able to see exactly.",
            "If there is, it, you know there's a bunch of functions that were contributing equally as in this case.",
            "Or maybe there's just one that's a problem area or something like that.",
            "Does that make sense?",
            "Thumbs up sideways.",
            "Stop me if it doesn't say so.",
            "There's a lot of stuff going on so you have to play with it used to it, but as reversing the path help for me because then I can see.",
            "OK, here's all instances of this guy.",
            "Same thing with these these to see down here.",
            "There's some Apple_stuff from the different call pass.",
            "OK, alright, repeat that one enough.",
            "So let's just so that we.",
            "So we've got this view.",
            "Here we can see where all the time is spent in the code.",
            "OK, so now I'm going to show you this.",
            "This shows you some of the call path information, but let's look at a different way of getting the call path information as well.",
            "So go back to that one thing with paragraph is it always keeps all your windows open.",
            "So in about 15 minutes you should have about 20 different Windows open, and so sometimes you have to pack around a little bit and find it.",
            "Right now we just have two, but you see here is this.",
            "Here is the.",
            "Here's the original place where we started, so if you go back to this window and check that out.",
            "So now we can get called path information for a given thread.",
            "By right clicking on that thread and then you see all these options for how you can display what was happening on process one or process zero thread zero, and so if I right click then there's this show thread call graph option and so if I fire that up then right away boom you've got this call path and these colors mean things.",
            "So this is the so the color and the width of the boxes are significant so by the color it's showing.",
            "Spot for exclusive time, so anything that took a lot of time in the function that takes a lot of exclusive kind is going to be posted to read an and then the which shows how much inclusive time there was.",
            "So the mentioned May is going to have an entire inclusive time of your other application and so May is among the wires of these things.",
            "He's kind of follow the sound.",
            "Follow these white functions down and see you know where the hotspots are and if I scroll with the mouse.",
            "Then Scroll down.",
            "So I Scroll down here.",
            "And you see, you can press execution.",
            "You can see where the hotspots are, so here's this little red outlook and see that everybody should be able to see it on the slides.",
            "There's this little red guy right there, and so that's our function of hot spot, so we can expand this out.",
            "We can pull this guy over and look at it, easy rose there.",
            "So and then we see the three different member, those three different regions of the code that we're calling that function.",
            "So there they are.",
            "These three in yellow.",
            "So there there they had some exclusive.",
            "And then so that's why the yellow.",
            "But they also had a criminal is inclusive or inclusive times due to the execution of this guy, right?",
            "So you can see that in families out with them around.",
            "So that is actually just a quick overview of the code, especially if you look at someone else's code.",
            "But even for your own, this can be very helpful.",
            "Any questions about that one, yes.",
            "So why are those colors why bother?",
            "I seduce inside of you because the exclusive time spent in those functions is very small.",
            "All they did was call another function and then and then all the all.",
            "The real time was spent down in these yellow ones and this one.",
            "But you see, these wide ones are in the in the call path of the ones that actually take all the time.",
            "So so the execution time of these gets counted in the inclusive time.",
            "For anything above it, anything in the direct path above it so that that's what makes these wide.",
            "Now you can actually, if you want to play around with this, you can go to options and you can.",
            "You can tell it what metric you want to make, determine the box with so you can switch it up.",
            "You can make the box width the xclusive time, and you can make the box color the inclusive time right?",
            "So exclusive time is now box width.",
            "Fox Color is now inclusive time.",
            "And Oh yeah, that came zooming alright, so now we see the main is very narrow 'cause now the because now it's the exclusive time in Maine is very small right?",
            "And it will show you here the xclusive you can hover over the years to get the name of what they are see.",
            "So but the inclusive time is high and so it's ready.",
            "And then if you go down to our hotspots then you see the widest functions are now.",
            "News that they have a lot of exclusive time.",
            "Other questions.",
            "Good question.",
            "Alright, so we can exit out of this view and I just wanted to point out really quickly.",
            "So let's go back to this main view again.",
            "You right click on a given thread and there you can also see the call path through a table view.",
            "So there's this statistics table and has a lot of nice things in it and actually shows again all the functions like a flat view of all the functions.",
            "But then if you look for the little.",
            "Looking for a little thing like this and then you can hear Maine and again, we've got it's red now because I switched this.",
            "Oh no, this is normal actually, so it will show you where the hotspots starts and if you open it up then maybe comes blue because there's not a lot of exclusive time.",
            "So before you open it, it's showing.",
            "This is where your hotspot starts.",
            "Follow this to find it, and so you open it up, it becomes blue.",
            "Click on this so you keep following this damn.",
            "Follow the red boxes down until the end.",
            "Farther away from blue, and then you find these three functions again.",
            "These three regions, really their own parallel regions where all the real action happens.",
            "And you can open up these one more time and we find out more about there's parallel region.",
            "There's parallel, do loop.",
            "OK, there's the actual function that we're still seeing that is responsible for most of the significant of the execution time.",
            "Alright, so there's like.",
            "I say lots of options here is just sort of give you an idea so you can play around with it.",
            "On your own it shows you so one significant thing.",
            "OK, let's look at this right here really quickly.",
            "OK, so let's have another pop quiz last day, so I think keeping keeping our minds on help keep us focused on the last few quizzes are in order.",
            "So again from yesterday.",
            "Who would say that we should?",
            "We should that this this meant the measurements we paid in here are an accurate, accurate representation of reality.",
            "For the execution time of the functions that we're seeing here and the code in general, who says make, I'll make everyone choose who's who says this is an accurate representation of reality.",
            "Raise your hand.",
            "Who?",
            "So there's a brave soul out there?",
            "Who says this is not a accurate representation of reality?",
            "OK, lots of hands going up, no OK. Can someone tell me why no.",
            "Something what's that?",
            "Depends on the sampling frequency.",
            "Hey, you're you're really close.",
            "You're on the right track.",
            "He says it's from sampling and so the accuracy depends on the sampling frequency.",
            "OK, that's really close, but not quite it.",
            "You know what, OK?",
            "Cereal.",
            "Really looking at means we have data for that function like across multiple nodes and threats and so so that there's a widespread and actually.",
            "That's a really good job remembering that one that's not quite it either.",
            "So in fact, in this one we're looking at this particular view we're looking at through process zero thread 0.",
            "So yeah, you can look at the average time, but you can also drill down on particular thread.",
            "So this answer was really close, but we're actually not doing sampling.",
            "We didn't do sampling yesterday, we did is direct instrumentation of the codes.",
            "Remember those two ways that you can?",
            "You can get the measurement.",
            "Sampling is 1 where you interrupt.",
            "You don't have to actually.",
            "Change the code at all.",
            "You just interrupted execution and see where the code is at, and then from there you get a statistical picture of how much what percentage of the given.",
            "You know the total execution time was spent in that particular part of the code that actually has very low overhead in general, and so it doesn't perturb reality very much, but instrumentation, which is what we actually did, insert functions into all of your functions, and so those functions.",

            "What was the?",
            "What was the difference between the two and the number roughly?",
            "As a factor of 2 into the factor 2 longer for that for the instrumented code to run, and so that means it's a factor of two longer.",
            "That means that you can't really trust the measurement.",
            "You need to reduce the overhead to less than 10%.",
            "You is like a good rule of thumb, 5% is better, but you have to have a little bit of trade off.",
            "There's a little bit of measurement has to be made, but you want to reduce that the way you do that is by eliminating tiny functions that get called millions of times.",

            "So I I wanted to spend a little bit time line just clarifying that because you're doing measurements.",
            "Really important to make sure that you can trust whatever it is you're measuring and that's the way to do it is to make sure the runtime is almost the same with or without instrumentation.",
            "OK, alright so we've jumped a few slides ahead here.",
            "OK, now I'm going to just quickly show you.",

            "You see, thread Zero has some extra execution time on the end if you Add all those together, but if you go the options you tell it to unstack those bars.",
            "Then as you go across for process zero, thread zero through six.",
            "You can see this little nice sort of quick view of the variation in runtime, and I was actually surprised that we do see it, although there's a very short measurement, we do see a little bit of load imbalance even in this highly optimized Nas parallel benchmark code.",
            "So for some reasons, reproducibly, we've got a pattern here.",
            "Threads five and six, the last two threads are taking much less time.",

            "Or maybe there's a totally different reason why this imbalance is there.",
            "We might want to increase the amount of work, so see if that actually remains the same.",
            "So you can look at now if you want to see this sort of again in a little bit, close up view for one of these colored bars.",
            "So here is this one that takes up the most time is whatever it is.",
            "It's been DC, RHS_so just click on this bar just left click on that one time.",
            "Now you see just for that function organized from highest exclusive time to lowest, all of the instances of that function on every thread, OK?",
            "So you can see this going down and there you see this big gap where here's threads five and six alone by themselves.",
