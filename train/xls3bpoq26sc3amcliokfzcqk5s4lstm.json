            "Web engine.",
            "So then what we did we we?",
            "We implemented crawling engine just basic crawling of the web gets the HTML gets out the links and just crawls the web like hold the search engines of it and stuff like this.",
            "OK then we store this into a relational database and then we have kind of three steps to actually extract the parallel corpus.",
            "First thing there is, I mean web is huge and any two web pages could be in general translations of one another, but since there are so many translations, we don't mind if we lose a lot of them.",
            "So first limitations we did.",
            "We said OK, we will only try to find pairs in the OR triples or more in the same domain.",
            "This is not always true.",
            "Some some organizations actually have they changed the top domain to change the language, but we don't care.",

            "I mean we could always.",

            "There can be thousands of documents and the number of Paris is squared, that right?",
            "Um?",
            "So what we do is we we.",
            "We have a step that's very simple that uses touristics and you just extract candidates.",
            "And we don't mind if you lose a lot of them, we just want to extract a lot of them.",
            "So yesterday there was talk how to the actual websites and the present there that they have more languages and it's kind of.",
            "Up to Web developer to reinvent the wheel every time.",
            "And this is true and I've been a web developer, so I have invented this wheel couple of times myself.",
            "But the truth is also that there are there are like some 4 five ways that generally people do it like this.",
            "So for example, it's very usual that actually you have a link and in this link you just change the basic URL by adding slash.",
            "Some keyword of the language slash or you can you just add a query parameter like language equals language code.",
            "And with a couple of such touristics, it's possible to actually extract the whole lot of candidates out of crawled web and and this is.",
            "And so this list of candidates is quite quite big.",
            "Then of course we want to filter them because for sure we got some mistakes here and what we do.",
            "We first parse the HTML text into just the textual parts that are interesting to us, and then we we actually work with this and we have several methods for filtering from the very simple ones like just compare the length to trying to have some statistical methods like Canonical kernel analysis, CCA.",
            "To actually try to filter any that aren't good.",
            "And everything.",

            "Guided tries to with machines populate the parallel text.",
