            "Tried to find out if it is OK for plant or not, So what we're doing is we're measuring something.",
            "So maybe sometimes the height and the width, and maybe how many seats they are producing.",
            "We cannot do this with Moses, right?",
            "This is not this heat plant is not flowering plant, right?",
            "It produces sparse.",
            "And it also has a green part, so this has two different parts.",
            "We are investigating both parts, so and now even in this one specie we have to differ between the methods we are using, right?",
            "So in the in the part of the sparse right, these little things which can germinate somehow.",
            "The first step is to see OK. Do they germinate after space exposure and then we differentiate of course?",
            "Was there irradiation, or was there no irradiation?",
            "Was there mass atmosphere or no Mars atmosphere, but just with this one method to see is there a germination and?",
            "To quantify that is the differentiation of the rate of germination of them, right?",
            "So do they germinate better or?",
            "More West.",
            "OK, and then there is the green part for example.",
            "For the bosses.",
            "And for that, so we went up to high mountain ranges in this with tabs, and we just took some.",
            "Some environmental samples, so this is not a lab strain when you have a lab strain may you can get them back and they are still aesthetic.",
            "That means you know they're clean.",
            "Right and you can just cultivate this in in Agar or special medium and you can see if it grows there or not, but for our one this is not axonic One South because we took them from the most harsh conditions.",
            "Of course we tried to clean them.",
            "And the only thing we're able to do with this now in one point to cultivate it is to cultivate it in an open in a more open condition.",
            "And this is what we're doing.",
            "We try to cultivate the green part just an we want to see if there is something which grows or not.",
            "OK, and then there's another part.",
            "Of course you can go to the deeper levels of DNA for both for the sparse and for the stems.",
            "But we're not doing this for other for our sports.",
            "We had sparse up there from machines are polymorpha.",
            "This is a specie which is widespread on Earth where you can find this everywhere.",
            "And this is the model Organism.",
            "Pretty soon I think so, so we know the whole genome actually, and so they started to look at the genetic level with this source.",
            "With our with our green stem we have we just start to develop methods to go on the genetic level.",
            "We're not pretty sure how to do this yet, but there are several approaches we we were testing actually.",
            "Right?",
            "Is it right?",
            "I just keep with most because otherwise it becomes a very long answer for me, OK?",
            "While the samples were mounted in space, we're able to monitor them at all.",
            "Or was everything done once they return back to Earth?",
            "I tried to repeat so you asked me if we monitor them up there in some kind of yeah.",
            "Well they were mounted.",
            "Did you have any access to them or do you just have to wait until they return back to measure them and do your experiments so it is something in between?",
            "We couldn't measure up there if they're still alive or not, so cultivating them under.",
            "On the vacuum close vacuum right or under mass conditions we cannot do that.",
            "We cannot afford that, so most of the samples we send up where dry.",
            "We measured them before.",
            "Under wet conditions, we drive them, send them up up there.",
            "There are some sensors which take care about how much on radiation comes on, how light cycle and so on.",
            "The the mass atmosphere was monitored, so we simulated mass atmosphere up there as well.",
            "This was monitored.",
            "Was it well wasn't it?",
            "And then they came back and now we water them again and see if they still do.",
            "Live life.",
            "Just a curiosity.",
            "When we were inviting you here, well we wanted that.",
            "Well.",
            "Our wish was that you bring with you the spores that were in space, but you were not allowed by your bosses to bring them here.",
            "This was why it was an emotional reason.",
            "They just didn't want to give their babies away or it was.",
            "Something else saved.",
            "I tried it, I tried quite hard.",
            "But it didn't succeed, so they're not here, of course, 'cause it's very important for scientists to keep the data.",
            "Control a little bit, 'cause when you don't know what happens with these samples and we even don't know many of these things, what happened in between and when they are more things which happened.",
            "Maybe the information loss is too high to say anything interesting about that to be sure about something.",
            "And this was the reason I couldn't bring you spores from space.",
            "But what I could bring you was spores we also use through the specie we used.",
            "In space.",
            "Just to give it to your lab and to to give you the opportunity to have some experiments by your own.",
            "With that right.",
            "And it's also for today that there's still a workshop.",
            "Maybe you want to join.",
