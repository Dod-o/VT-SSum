            "Is that correct?",
            "And the answer to that is yes, but I'll elaborate.",
            "So as long as there is collateral, the bank will help a smaller company.",

            "Therefore we like, we believe in this idea is being potentially disruptive.",
            "Obviously, still need to achieve proof points, so we were able to put in a million and a half into the company and the instrument that's used in venture capital is you buy preferred shares.",
            "So yes, that happens all the time in some cases, which we don't.",
            "Do as often anymore, because sometimes when you're looking at something that's very early stage, it's very hard to put a value.",

            "So good question.",
            "Because we are funded by the Government of Canada, part of the mandate is to commercialize Canadian innovation and Canadian IP.",
            "So the mandate is to start there so.",
            "I would say we are prevented and it's a it's not black and white, but I would say if we were to fund a company I kind of use the heart and soul test the heart and soul of the company has to be Canadian so the Founders, the key technology has to originate from Canada.",
            "Having said that, it doesn't preclude us from saying there are certain aspects of development that could happen outside of Canada.",

            "Strengths could be in wireless could be in optics but you cannot have strengths in all the areas and so the if you want to build a company and be very capital efficient the right way to look at it is to say how can I leverage other sources of innovation from different companies.",
            "I think the US does that.",
            "More effectively, but in the venture capital world today, capital efficiency is very critical.",
            "Just to give you a simple example, if you kind of take the view, the old view, which is it has to be originated out of Canada to build a software company from inception to cash flow, break even or exit might cost you 25,000,000 to 20,000,000.",
            "You leverage strengths outside of the country today and it's this can be done for under 10,000,000.",
            "So if you're still kind of trying to do this the old way may not necessarily be a very smart strategy.",
            "Having said that.",
            "We are part of a government institution.",
            "It's a mandate of the government, is written in law.",
            "These things take time to change, right?",
            "So what are some of the criteria that define a Canadian if you will opportunity for you?",
            "Is it just the headquarters of the company?",
            "Is it a certain percentage of development that has to be done there?",
            "Just add something to that question so if one of my clients is like a research lab, that would be really interesting to fund.",
            "Can we move to Canada and get funding from you?",
            "Yes, you're good.",
            "If it meets our criteria absolutely, expression is going to be what is your criteria given that you know you had 60 two companies come in and two companies come out of your system.",
            "So what is the main criteria?",
            "Because I've worked with VCs trying also to get my ex Co funded and they all say they want groundbreaking things.",
            "They want novel things.",
            "But then as the process goes on, you find they quite want secure things that they know 100% are going to make you know anything on the market.",
            "So yeah, you know, that's like.",
            "I've come to your answer, but that's like the best analogy I can think of is you're saying, well, how do I know that you're the right?",
            "So if I'm looking for a partner in life, how do I know she is the right partner?",
            "And how do I know I'm in love?",
            "Can you tell me what the criteria is and you say I'll know when I feel it right?",
            "And so to certain extent, VC investment is like that.",
            "And so this is our little fickle that way, right?",
            "You kind of say I have a criteria.",
            "And two weeks, as you say, 2 weeks from now the VC will say, well, I've changed my mind.",
            "I've raised the bar blah blah blah.",
            "But there is a process.",
            "The process of the way we look at it is.",
            "If you can visualize 2 axis, the vertical axis is return potential.",
            "So I'm looking for.",
            "Something that's going to give me a high return.",
            "Is that possible and how do you determine that?",
            "Obviously part of it is the VC does his own diligence or her own due diligence, and the entrepreneur has due diligence.",
            "Sometimes they are in alignment and sometimes they're not.",
            "So an entrepreneur will say I think I'm playing in a billion dollar market and you say wait a minute when I really condense it down and really focus on what you're really doing.",
            "You're actually playing in a $50,000,000 niche market, but getting back to.",
            "Market size is important because that drives return potential.",
            "The other stuff we look at an place.",
            "A lot of emphasis is in the potential of the management team that carries a higher, very high weight becausw actually do I have it here?",
            "Maybe I don't.",
            "Yeah, actually I do that, you know?",
            "So I was expecting this question.",
            "So so, but there are number of I think, the most important management teams important becausw.",
            "What I have learned is.",
            "The wrong management team from the Getgo.",
            "Or if you have the wrong people at the table with you will destroy the company.",
            "Just just how do I know that?",
            "It's from having experienced many failures, so I call it pattern recognition.",
            "You're sitting around the table and you're hearing this management team going blah blah blah blah blah and you go.",
            "I think I have a problem here, right?",
            "So pattern recognition comes with experience.",
            "The other aspect that people underestimate is.",
            "Value proposition, pain point and how compelling is it?",
            "So look.",
            "Which entrepreneur is going to come to you and say that I'm not solving a serious?",
            "Everybody is solving a serious pain point right?",
            "But the reality is how real is it and how serious is it and what you find is.",
            "That's when the rubber hits the road and.",
            "Real good entrepreneurs really understand the customer pain point.",
            "I'll give you a simple example.",
            "I'll go one company where the CEO and the management says this is got to do with the whole mobile space infrastructure capacity improvement.",
            "And they're saying, look, I can defer investments in wireless networks because I can squeeze more juice out of more bandwidth out of wireless network.",
            "This is a 2 billion dollar savings to the wireless operator.",
            "So I'm going look.",
            "We've been talking about this for four years now, and not a single purchase order has been received.",
            "So are you really saving 2 billion dollars?",
            "If your wireless operator and if you really believe that I was going to saving, I was going to be saving you 2 billion dollars, which you know we would be would be all over that, right?",
            "So I think really getting down to the bottom of customer pain.",
            "Point value prop an.",
            "Is it real?",
            "So so I think that's important.",
            "I think the other aspect that that at least I look at is.",
            "A lot of entrepreneurs will say I have an idea.",
            "I've talked to two customers and I have validated my idea, but have you really understood your customer decision-making process?",
            "Some customers and I can send this to you by email or what some other criteria.",
            "Interesting material, but I would say a large.",
            "Portion.",
            "Of entrepreneurs.",
            "The tax stamp.",
            "Some figure it out sooner, some later, but the understanding the decision-making process.",
            "Is not well understood and this is where a client can string you along.",
            "Like you know, let's look at EMC.",
            "You all may tell you that this is an interesting technology.",
            "And by the way, I need to know more and you're kind of engaged in a dance and you find out three years into it that he is actually not the real decision maker.",
            "Just kind of it is a big Corporation and fire.",
            "You learn three years into it, that really there are four other decision makers that have to rerun.",
            "Decide whether this is an interesting opportunity for the company to consider.",
            "That's when things can go off the rails very quickly, and even if you're talking to the right person right, it can be.",
            "I mean, the large companies have.",
            "Long time lines it can be completely on the right track and the decision is just not going to get made for two years.",
            "So Sylvia was saying, at least in the communication companies that start up companies when they tell me that their first client is British Telecom or they tell me that they are targeting Siemens or Nokia.",
            "And I say that's where startup companies go to die because.",
            "Can take two years, sometimes three years, to get your first purchase order.",

            "One more comment you mentioned.",
            "Syndicate again Syndicate is like your coin Masters.",
            "That's again like being in a marriage with somebody for five 6 seven years.",
            "I learned that the hard way, again, choosing the right syndicate partner life partner 'cause you're in it for five to seven years is extremely important.",
            "So what I mean by that is alignment.",
            "I've seen companies where you do the you kind of engage in a transaction and find out that you right away are in disagreement with the exit disagreement with the strategy.",
            "That is, pardon my language.",
            "The kiss of death.",
            "And lots of other things, but I think I've hit on the key points.",
