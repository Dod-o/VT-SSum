        [

            "Right now talking to this but there are emulated sensors that are reporting observations in real time to this interface and there is a delay in the network.",
            "So for some reason it takes like 2 three minutes to the data.",
            "Kind of to report to this.",
            "Service however I would.",
            "Probably wait on that and show you so today morning I was.",
            "Kind of looking at different observations that are reported.",
            "So since these are emulated sensors, no need to worry.",
            "There is no meeting in this room, so you have these different sensors reporting location information and also the observations.",
            "And when I just clicked on one of them I could see that this was the location and this is where we are approximate location and the way it is done is the sensor that registers with the system.",
            "The back end system.",
            "It takes the lat long information off the registered sensor.",
            "Then it queries geonames.",
            "So this is part of the reason are that's written in the back end, so queries Geonames gets the name location for the lat long and pushes it to the knowledge base so that you can actually query for location based kind of information and before going to the next one so the intensity is kind of shown in the kind of the diameter of the hole.",
            "Circle there, and these are the sensor observations that were reported.",
            "So let me see.",
            "OK, finally it has worked OK, so here are the real time sensor observations that are reported.",
            "So let's say I change it to.",
            "Methane and oxygen?",
            "So I should be able to see in some time.",
            "Sorry for the delay.",
            "I think it's probably going to take some time.",
            "Uh.",
            "Overall LA take home kind of messages.",
            "Dynamic registration is very important and semantic processing to go from raw level kind of data to higher level abstractions.",
            "Considering that there is domain knowledge to be incorporated in the processing, so that's the reason are component.",
            "You could see that the meter and oxygen showed up there.",
            "OK, that's it from my side.",
            "Any questions?",
            "So what is it that you do that cannot be done without or cannot be done without assistant without semantic annotations without domain ontology without reasoning?",
            "What are the?",
            "You know are there.",
            "Can you declare some major success stories saying that these are the things that make these kind of impossible?",
            "Otherwise it cannot be done, and this specific thing of all these with regards to the dynamic nature of this is OK. To answer your first question, first of all, you saw that we modeled sensors so there has to be a representation language where we can model sensors, and when we model it, it should also make sense to others.",
            "So it's good to use standards like Assistant Ontology for example, and you can make queries something like.",
            "Give me all the.",
            "Temperature sensors in this location, or if you want to go one step ahead, you can say give me all the temperature sensors and let's say you want to find out gaseous content so you can combine two or three observations and ask for queries on this data set.",
            "Once you have declared the ontology and the reasoning reasoning part right so it actually is a component which not only uses deductive kind of reasoning.",
            "So you can leverage the benefit of deductive kind of reasoning.",
            "Also you can use linked open data, so without linked open data I couldn't have gone from Lat Long to location name, so that's the first part of your question and.",
            "Sorry, what is your second question?",
            "Logies and reasoning that you know, OK, I think your second question was the dynamism.",
            "Right?",
            "Right, right?",
            "And sauce standards.",
            "Without semantics.",
            "Versions of it or up.",
            "So you can potentially do most of it except for the reasoning and the connecting part.",
            "So the advantage here is you have lat Long location which is raw sensor data.",
            "You're moving to a location information which is more intuitive and you in that process you're actually leveraging the data that's already there, so you don't need to create new datasets, so you can link up to the existing datasets and your second question was dynamism, so.",
            "The dynamism part.",
            "It it's not, it doesn't necessarily need semantic web technologies in this case.",
            "However, if you want to leverage domain knowledge, that is, you want to use domain knowledge of fire.",
            "For example, to model ontology, and you actually query sensor stream using the using background knowledge in the process.",
            "So in that case it's kind of important, but for dynamism itself there is no direct involvement of semantic web technologies here.",
            "OK."
