            "Probabilistic model, which is essentially saying that you know you contributes some fraction of what you know.",
            "If you're somebody who knows a lot, that fraction might improve the page quite significantly, and since we're modeling how much you know is a stochastic process, you know that might to some extent be getting captured, but we haven't looked at it explicitly as part of the model we're trying to keep the model, at least up to this point as simple as possible, but it's a very good point, actually.",
