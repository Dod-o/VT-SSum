            "The end time is the red.",
            "So the yellow is the me Renee.",
            "The red is enzyme and the green are metabolites, so the product and the substrate.",
            "These are the connecting points to control the flux, how its cows controlling from the marinatto the enzyme here and how this is the complex of enzyme and substrate.",

            "How about you?",
            "Not yet.",
            "So explain again what is connected.",
            "Except so out so so we have.",
            "The input has to be connected over the end time.",
            "And then end time is connected to the end time.",
            "Metabolite story metabolite and then the metabolite.",
            "So this is the substrate.",
            "It's connected to the to the.",
            "Complex of enzyme and and and substrate.",
            "And.",
            "How the end?",
            "So this is how the flags go, how the enzyme is converting substrate to product.",
            "But then this is controlled via enzyme.",
            "We are in some activity.",
            "An enzyme is controlled.",
            "How usually by Ameren expression we have a large or large gap in between, but let's say it's like that, so more me, Renee.",
            "Usually you have more anti man more activity.",
            "So.",
            "Everybody did it yet yeah, so then we can try it.",
            "You can.",
            "Check the model.",
            "And then you can hear on simulation simulate.",
            "And then you get another window for plotting.",
            "So.",
            "So I don't know how to make the geometry of his life proper to make the lines up or down, since like you, so I will.",
            "I will delete this.",
            "And and do it one more time, so from this.",
            "You get a plus if you are at the add a note.",
            "OK then you click.",
            "And then you drag.",
            "You see what does it do?",
            "Just go to.",
            "This one.",
            "And click on it.",
            "And now it's connected.",
            "And if I would like to go from this side again, click OK.",
            "It doesn't.",
            "It doesn't do it nicely, you see.",
            "So then I go down.",
            "Click again.",
            "Just be.",
            "Seems to be important because it didn't work for me and my your case looks like a mess.",
            "Yeah, but you can imagine that this is a simple model.",
            "If you have a mass, no problem, but you have a bigger model.",
            "It's a big problem, OK?",
            "And now everybody should go to simulation.",
            "If you have it and simulate.",
            "And you can close this window afterwards.",
            "So on this right side you see all that you have put into the model.",
            "So information enzyme as reaction.",
            "So this is the complex.",
            "Amy Renee.",
            "Elimination product and source OK. And then if you go to plus four the end time.",
            "We have Q, so this is the quantity and the concentration.",
            "And we have to put here.",
            "We have to take it.",
            "If we take it then we will see it on the window.",
            "We will see the concentration of the of the enzyme, so it's one.",
            "And then we have the M RNA.",
            "We also take it.",
            "Product and the substrate.",
            "So on the upper thing you would see different colors or enzyme.",
            "For me at least, I have it read me Renee.",
            "It's blue product.",
            "It's green and substrate is light blue.",
            "Yeah.",
            "OK, so this is now a steady state.",
            "Everything is set to one, so everything should be one.",
            "And now we can play a little bit with the model.",
            "But it's probably much easier than to play here inside because you have a lot of different fluxes and everything we can go back to modeling.",
            "And the first thing is for the simulation simulation set up start time at zero and Stop Time is one we have to change this to 1000.",
            "Here, here.",
            "Cancel so here we are on plotting you see here.",
            "And modeling.",
            "So simulation.",
            "Simulation setup.",
            "It was probably one.",
            "Everybody had it so you have to put here in 1000.",
            "Everybody can see it.",
            "It's large enough to know.",
            "OK, and then we can do it cancel.",
            "We have 1000 now and now we can change.",
            "We can play a little bit so if we change me Renee.",
            "We can just.",
            "Click on the M RNA.",
            "So we have the quantity at the starting point at the time zero, it's one.",
            "Change it to change, change it to 10.",
            "And then.",
            "Simulate.",
            "You should get this.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It is too fast or.",
            "Everybody got it.",
            "So now you can see that the product because the the end product stays the same at the value one.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So we have changed the amerinet so it was it is 10.",
            "Yeah, and it's all the time and it's all the time that N becausw.",
            "It's the starting of 1 branch.",
            "And what happened to the enzyme?",
            "It increased.",
            "By 10 that's normal.",
            "After a while, if it's more Amy Renee, you get more enzyme activity.",
            "Actually with the enzyme.",
            "Also, activity increases and what happened to the substrate it went down.",
            "Because the.",
            "We have more enzyme activity.",
            "More substrate is used, so once again this is the dynamical thing.",
            "What happens from one steady state with everything is the same to another steady state with something when something changed.",
            "OK. OK, we can go back and play what play with something else so we can put the Emera neilly emerin level back.",
            "So.",
            "Back to one.",
            "And we can change the end sign.",
            "So 10.",
            "And again.",
            "Simulate.",
            "So here we see the end time was at the starting point was 10, but then it went down.",
            "Why?",
            "Because it was used, but the Ameren level is at once, so at one steady state it came the end time to also to the Level 1.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And again, the product is fixed at one.",
            "Because everything thanks to the tenants to the product, but the subset wait up.",
            "Change.",
            "At the beginning.",
            "Yep.",
            "So you click on the symbol.",
            "Now we have changed the enzyme.",
            "And in the end, the amount of enzyme here in this simple model is the activity of enzyme.",
            "If it's more enzyme, the bigger activity.",
            "But enzyme has a back door, so it's far from me.",
            "Renee and a marinate still at level one, so.",
            "Because that's a red line, yes.",
            "Over the entire company, this yes, and this is and this is so this time is.",
            "These are arbitrary time units because if we have kinetic parameters then we will have a real time.",
            "But now it's just arbitrary units.",
            "OK.",
            "So we can go back again, put it back attributes.",
            "The one.",
            "And then we can change the product.",
            "Yeah, we changed back to the starting point everything.",
            "And now we can change the product.",
            "Also the temp.",
            "An simulate.",
            "So the product doesn't because there is no, we don't have a feedback loop.",
            "So it doesn't change nothing, just the product stays attend.",
            "But now more interesting, we go back again.",
            "We put the product again back to one.",
            "So at time one as I'm zero, it's one and now we can play with the enzyme so.",
            "This is a simple model yet now.",
            "But if you have.",
            "Because you make these reactions irreversible somehow, exactly yes.",
            "Yes, that's where it's going in that direction.",
            "And now if you look at the parameters for the end time, so we have the starting concentration, we have K1K one is the elimination constant and K2 is the constant that changes K1.",
            "Well, I didn't do the model like that.",
            "This was what Alex did, but this is what does it mean and switch time means the time when when the when this K2 influences the K1.",
            "So let's say if you starting point is 0 and we have a 1001 thousand units and if you change it after 1010 units then something will change because the K1 will change because of K2.",
            "How to play?",
            "What happens with the enzyme?",
            "This is like you if you put a drug.",
            "Let's say you can change.",
            "You actually change the K1 activity.",
            "So the basic is 0.01 and we can change the K2 to.",
            "0.02 So the so with this, so this is the elimination constant.",
            "So the elimination is.",
            "Twice the faster yeah.",
            "OK and then simulate.",
            "So is it something you expected?",
            "What happened?",
            "So again, the the product.",
            "Is fixed.",
            "The end time went down because the degradation was faster and it went and it went down.",
            "How much if you look if we zoom in here we will say it's 0.5.",
            "Twice.",
            "And if you want to go back if we zoom in it's fit in view.",
            "And the substrate had to go twice up.",
            "Yeah, it makes sense.",
            "OK. And then we can try it with go back to modeling.",
            "Will enzyme.",
            "So before it was 0.01, now we can put 0.005.",
            "So now the degradation is twice the slower as in the beginning.",
            "Let's simulate.",
            "And now we get the different picture.",
            "So the enzyme went up twice and the substrate went twice down.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But everything else stayed the same, cause the goal of this simple model is to make the substrate and state at one.",
            "And now we can try.",
            "We can try.",
            "K1 let me see.",
            "Here.",
            "Back to the inside.",
            "So before it was 0.01.",
            "So if you put 0.1, what would you?",
            "What would be?",
            "What do you expect?",
            "It was 0.01 and now it's 10 times more.",
            "We get 10 times more.",
            "In both directions.",
            "But and tell us where K1 where you would write K1 in this team.",
            "Could you talk about the elimination, yeah.",
            "I don't know which one it is.",
            "It's here in illumination of the complex.",
            "This.",
            "So that's basically the reaction from C2 E. Yeah.",
            "And now we can try to really really lower the elimination.",
            "So we're still at the end time we put it 0.00.",
            "1.",
            "And simulate.",
            "So everybody got this.",
            "Yep.",
            "Do you see something wrong with this?",
            "No.",
            "So what what did I say that this this?",

            "Steady state to another steady state.",
            "Take a little off.",
            "Yeah, the time is too short.",
            "So we can go back to the model and simulation step.",
            "We have to put not 1000 but 10,000.",

            "Yeah.",

            "I could say that try to to make a model, but it will take a lot of time.",
            "So.",
            "We can open.",
            "A new model that I gave that I gave to you.",
            "So open.",
            "Model.",

            "OK you have to click on it.",
            "This looks a little bit different, doesn't it?",
            "Really will more complex now you see why everything has to be really nicely oriented, otherwise you would not know.",
            "And you can see if you if you click on an enzyme.",
            "I'm at my tablet.",
            "Yes, sorry.",
            "Attributes so you have a special.",

            "So now this is a full cholesterol synthesis pathway.",

            "Yeah.",
            "So statins block which enzyme?",
            "Yeah yeah, can you find it?",
            "Where should it be?",

            "This one is the first one is.",
            "And if you click on it.",

            "Switch time is nothing, yeah?",
            "OK, if you simulate this you will get a release.",
            "Silly thing so simulate.",
            "And delete this results from the basic model.",
            "And again here we have to you see a lot of different.",

            "But this is everything is 1, but it's just switching because of the model.",
