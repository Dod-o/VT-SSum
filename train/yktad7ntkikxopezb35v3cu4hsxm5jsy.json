            "And then on the web, in the semantically enriched program you found it type, which is displayed here.",
            "It's not the government called vocabularies and Federation of National Semantic Asset Repositories.",
            "The European Commission approach no.",
            "Which title is right title?",
            "I leave that to you to the site so, but what is sure that this panel session is about the government?",
            "It's about semantic interoperability and it is about linked open data.",
            "So if you would like to have this panels session as interactive as possible, so feel free to interrupt, raise your hand and interrupt and whenever you see fit and we will try to deal with your questions or your comments.",

            "And this is an initiative to promote that, say, and to enhance semantic interoperability, egovernment in Europe.",

            "So thanks, most of you know who I am by now from the keynote and a few other things.",
            "But what I don't know you all know is what the actual research I mostly work on these days, which is actually linked open government data and the US Open Government data site is currently the largest in the world.",

            "Or there we have demos.",
            "About 50 demos.",

            "The semantic web and the link data technology is so powerful for doing this kind of data integration that the open government data needs a sensually creating data mashups.",

            "15 different countries, seven different languages, so one of the things that shows is this is something that's really happening now.",
            "Now of that, that's just data you can get your hands on some of its free seven big costs.",
            "Only a small fraction of that is currently in linked data form, but more and more of the governments are getting interested in linked data.",
            "Because of the successes with that that both the US and the UK data Gov UK site, the second largest has about 7000 web datasets available.",

            "In, let's say, innovative applications and these applications don't need to be in the government domain necessarily, but they can be in other domains as well.",

            "It turned out that we often had to resort to, like site scraping techniques or other.",
            "A very ugly things actually, so I think that this making the data somehow available openly and structured form is a very important first step, and afterwards I created and this was the first step that the data that golf has taken actually.",
            "And do you agree with what has been said but called calories but first published?",
            "I think very much that the starting place is getting the data out there that small vocabularies.",

            "In fact, one of the things that made it possible for us to do so much we did with data Gov.",

            "Was it when we did conversions we didn't have to understand why, so a database from the government just to make it clear to you these things can be very, very large.",
            "the US Environmental Protection Agency has one data set.",
            "It has about 170 columns.",
            "So.",

            "As long as you know enough about them.",

            "Is that something the British did in data Gov UK which is very very important?",
            "We are now working on in the US and I strongly recommend to the Commission is careful you arrive.",
            "So we can't do it.",
            "Just to give you an idea, in Britain if you look out your window and there's a school across the street, if you understand there you are.",
            "I design you could figure out what the UI would be for that school, which means that you could then type it into your browser and see the collected information to dereferenceable information about where it is, what it is, what datasets are about it, things like that.",
            "It makes things much much more doable if you know about a different sector.",
            "If you know about certain kinds of government things you want to find all the things about a certain agency.",
            "They have a very careful scheme for delineating what's in the actual data, what's in the actual descriptors about the data, where if you see one of these, you arise, you can actually know where to go.",
            "Look for the vocabulary.",
            "So these kind of things are extremely important.",
            "This is a community that's been saying that for a lot of years, and it was really impressive to see an entire government agency instead of so.",
            "The ministries said the government agencies must use these terms and it makes their government much.",

            "An interruptible than any other catalog in the world because they put that careful design and so that's another important.",
