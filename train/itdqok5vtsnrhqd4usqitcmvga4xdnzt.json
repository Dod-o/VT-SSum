            "OK, so for that particular example the number of guys on the right that match with this guys just one.",

            "If in all possible matchings.",
            "The number of different partners is at least K. OK, so it's not like maybe a feasible definition, but it's still a definition that we are free to make.",
            "So what we sold is that this definition is still a relaxation of the anonymity.",
            "So every set that is canonized is also global canonized, so this would be obvious.",
            "And also there are sets that global 1K1K minimize but not canonized.",
