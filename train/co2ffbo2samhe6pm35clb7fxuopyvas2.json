            "The second is the scope so that there's the limits of the policy, including the time frame and to whom it applies, which are particularly important for different types of our policy that I'll talk about since a lot of these policies can be time limited.",

            "Which are the four types of ovr policy that we identified going to give examples for each of these in the examples are far from exhaustive, certainly, and these aren't even necessarily the only four types of our policies that might be out there.",
            "It's just sort of the natural four categories that came out of sort of our survey of the landscape of OR policies as we saw them.",

            "Or not.",

            "It's important when these policies are to put into place that the one the government or the body putting the policy into place actually monitors the compliance with these policies to make sure they actually sort of achieving sort of the open licensing that they set out to.",
            "And that's certainly important.",
            "Another thing is that these policies hopefully tend to be stronger than some of the others and have more aggressive open licenses.",
            "For example, the first example I'll give has a requires a Creative Commons Attribution only license.",
            "And the thinking there is that for these policies you know the government is funding these research.",
            "It's public dollars that are funding.",
            "Sorry, said research and educational materials.",
            "So because the public funding it, we feel that there really shouldn't.",
            "There's not a good argument for there being more restrictive reuse rights than are absolutely necessary, and so we feel like Creative Commons Attribution license is a particularly sort of important license to advocate for for these policies so."

        [
            "The first example I will mention is that act Grant instituted by the US Department of Labor.",
            "Very long acronym, but essentially what the program does is it requires an open line, puts an open licensing requirement requiring a CC by license on any materials that are produced with grant funds, and this is a 2 billion dollar grant program that will be given out in 500 million dollar increments over I believe four years.",
            "And so this was a huge sort of chunk of open educational resources that was put into place.",

            "And then the Department of Labor, as they were, sort of coming up with the guidelines for people that wanted to apply for this grant funding, inserted a clause requiring an open license, and so that's why this qualifies as licensing policy."

            "I mean, on the plus side, it allows authors to be in control of what license they use, but on the negative second lead to confusion, and there's also problems with sort of creating a patchwork of different licenses because.",
            "As many of you probably know, lots of Creative Commons licenses don't interoperate with one another, so if you have share alike as one of your clauses, that doesn't sort of play nicely with some of the others, because with the share alike license, any derivative of that work has to be licensed under that the same terms.",

            "If you're publishing a Journal that makes the final peer reviewed manuscript available after six months, so this is an example of a policy that requires open licensing for research outputs, which is an interesting progression from other Open Access policies that we've seen some of you might be familiar with policies like the National Institutes of Health Open Access policy in US that just simply requires articles to be made freely available online within 12 months of publication, but doesn't have anything to say about reuse rights, and so it is good to see.",
