            "I mean it if most will use for business.",
            "If most of the text says something that makes it that is true, but OK, I I would say it is not the truth always OK with you, but what can we do if CNN lies what you have to go to the bank and see the things that they're building?",

            "So I put it differently.",

            "Actually, we show that we we take.",
            "For example, if you have for one event for one, we have these classes which collects the menus from this from different sources.",
            "So if many sources if I sources report that there were five that in one source we bought that there were, there was one that person and this show news going the same cluster, then we would say OK there five people dead.",

            "So we use the distichs for statistics is the frequency is the truth actually?",
            "Question for this speaker I have a confusion about the distinction between defense and space in this framework, and so you mentioned that you're worried about the temporal modification on there's difference between events in States and how do you modify them?",
            "An event happens in some time duration and state happens for.",
            "Sometime duration and English.",
            "And then you talk about peace events and conflict events, but I I felt think of peace and conflict has space so but I appreciate you've got an event browser, but I wondered the extent to which you worried about the distinction between events in space in your ontology.",
            "Well, first of all I I should say the categories that are here are not 100% aligned to the ontology categories and the piece category or the concept we had in our ontology model.",
            "But OK, I think we're only considering events as such.",
            "So actually in the in the ontology we don't.",

            "The concepts only help you to talk about things.",
            "In our case, the things are the conflict events and the and the piece events that we want to have in our model so that when we're searching for in formation, let's take it from the other end.",
            "When we're searching for information, we want to be able to find them also, so it's a part of our model.",
            "It's not states, but it's.",
            "Concepts that we would like to talk about.",
            "So now the evolution is.",
            "The constant, yeah, the concern about the evolution is because today one event we talk about it as a conflict event.",
            "And it is there at that time point and we move in the time frame that event evolved to be another concept because it has changed its properties.",
            "It is no longer cause it is no longer conflicted and it doesn't carry those properties to be considered as a conflict event.",
            "It has other properties it has, it is PC land, so this transition between the temporal transition in between is the major challenge.",
            "That we are seeking to model also capture also and yeah.",
