            "OK, so well I should thickness data is extracted from the ice core itself cause you may you know precisely measure the pressure of gas in the ice.",
            "And the pressure depends on altitude, so you just may obtain the altitude always St and then you may recalculate it into the volume somehow.",

            "Land was bigger than now because the ocean was low.",
            "And also the transportation from tropics to polar areas were stronger because of stronger meridional gradient and this caused the increase of dust during Ice Age.",
