            "In many.",
            "I mean all speech technology.",
            "That's what how they trained the system, so that's not what the baby is doing now.",

            "So they talk slower.",

            "So maybe it was going on is that the baby likes that kind of speech and the baby is giving feedback to the mother by smiling and then the mother is reinforcing that.",
            "So basically it's the babies programming the mother to speak like that but not vice versa.",
            "So the.",
            "Idea there is that it's it's sort of this kind of interaction.",
            "Highlights was going on in more in the social domain more than in language domain, but I think I think it's it's completely open issue.",

            "One or two years they start to learn words and their parents are going to to say words in particular contexts.",

            "If the baby is looking at that light, it's going to start the tape OK, but the sound is stopping as soon as the baby is not looking.",
            "So basically the baby is controlling by his looking how much of that particular kind of sound he wants to hear.",
            "And with this kind of technique you can measure the sort of the preference.",

            "Yes.",

            "If you remain with lots of allophones, they are fine.",
            "You don't make errors, but the problem is how to group them.",

            "It is so useful information of course, but it's not enough to group them to cluster them properly.",
            "So that's why in it, instead of just doing a archical clustering based on acoustic similarity, we introduce other kind of similarities like the lexical similarity and the contextual similarity, so to speak.",
            "And that's that's it needs, then you need to formalize the problem slightly differently, but that's that's the idea.",

            "Yeah, so it's true that.",

            "It has lots of contraction and changes in the signal that are typical of natural spontaneous speech, but it doesn't have the background.",
            "Now she doesn't have all kinds of other problems now like this, yes.",
            "So I think that would be the next step.",
            "I mean, we're just going slowly.",
            "We the sum signal that's not too bad, and it's already quite difficult to obtain some results.",
            "But yeah, I mean ultimately the baby is doing that and actually not only that, but it's just amazing what inference can do, because not only they can do this task in the middle of high number, I mean enormous noise around them, but they can also do that when people around them are talking different languages.",
            "Right, so I give you the example of the Hindi.",
            "The Hindi sound now.",
            "Typically infants who learn the Hindi contrast also hearing English and other languages around them.",

            "If they were just doing this statistical clustering thing, they would just completely messed up everything.",
            "So there there must be other kind of processes that are going to filter the sound from the noise from the background noise but also discriminates between different kinds of languages so that not to mix them together.",
            "So we are very far from the standing where the babies are doing, yeah.",
            "From the brain.",
            "Like opening that you mean.",
            "Yeah, well, I agree.",
            "I mean, I mean first of all, I mean, it's not very difficult to to at least in France, to have parents participate in experiments.",
            "They usually are quite interested in.",
            "In what their baby is doing, some of a lot of them ask us.",
            "OK is he is the baby doing well this is going to be good in school and all this kind of questions, but.",
            "The problem I mean I agree with the of course it's more direct to measure the brain, but the problem is that we not measuring directly the brain.",
            "We're measuring a signal that's completely full of artifacts when the baby is moving, the things are jumping around we have.",
            "No, no, I completely agree.",
            "I mean, that's that's part of the project.",
            "But the problem is that brain imaging in babies is a relatively new area.",
            "I mean, EG has been around for quite awhile now and it's becoming better, but.",

            "The analysis methods are not really working well.",
            "I mean they also babies are not behaving.",
            "I mean they take the they removed.",
            "So that's that.",
            "You can't do anything about about that, yeah?",
            "Yeah, that's a very good question.",
            "I think.",
            "I mean, we know that babies are learning lots of things.",
            "I mean at the same time, they're they're learning in the social domain they're doing.",
            "They're learning about objects in the world, how to interact with them, how to program their movement, all these things.",
            "So there's learning at all levels at the same time.",
            "But if you think of language.",
            "We know that babies are able to learn language in a different modality, like saying language, for instance, babies whose parents use sign language.",
            "So the parents are deaf.",
            "They don't.",
            "They're not using the spoken language.",
            "Even if the baby is hearing, the baby is learning the signs and the learning rates the learning curves that you find you do observe for babies during the first year of life is just the same.",
            "Autumn is is also looks very similar.",
            "I mean you have hand shape OK to code the different distinctions, but the signal is completely variable.",
            "You can you can do.",
            "You can be viewed in different ways.",
            "You can have some.",
            "You have to articulation.",
            "If you you start to move your hand to do a gesture here, but you come from here the endpoints going to be different.",
            "All these context effects and how many categories how many contrast you have?",
            "Same problem so but nobody is has been starting to work on algorithms.",
            "But the same problem, yeah?",
            "I thought you said that.",
            "These are going to prefer listening to different kinds of voices.",
            "For instance, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Oh sure, sure, sure.",
            "So we know we know that babies, for instance, prefer to listen to voices that are happy.",
            "For instance, if you have.",
            "If you say hello, they prefer that, then hello, that's working very well.",
            "And that's that's actually an issue for babies whose parents are depressed, for instance, that raises the issue of the questions whether their language is going learning is going to be delayed or not.",
            "For instance, that's the kind of question you can ask.",
            "Because we know that babies have preferences.",
            "Not clear that there.",
            "I don't think they have preferences for male or female, but also they have they have preference.",
            "In general, their preferences for speech sounds, I mean, typically speech sounds are interesting and prefer to listen to this kind of sounds, then completely artificial sounds.",
            "But all of these preferences are changing throughout the first year of life.",
            "Initially they are not distinguishing any languages, and actually even at birth they also are interested by monkey vocalizations, for instance, and monkey vocalizations are as interesting as language at birth, but then quickly they prefer human language and then quickly become they prefer their own language.",
            "Oh, that's a good find.",
            "Don't remember.",
            "I think I think now.",
            "I mean previously in the in the history of of psycholinguistics of babies, people where initially using a lot of synthetic speech because that was a way to control very precisely the sound.",
            "But now there are ways to use natural sounds and just make modify them artificially so that you can control what you want to control, like for instance voicing.",
            "You can create a continuum of voicing with completely natural sounds, and that's way better because then it's it's just more interesting for the baby and.",
            "Yeah, I mean this.",
            "These are the kind of questions that everyone is looking at.",
            "Yeah, so so.",
            "Indeed babies here a lot of the environment in the womb.",
            "It's heavily filtered.",
            "So basically weather here is something like.",
            "So they would hear the prosody, the intonation, the rhythm.",
            "It's not clear that they would be able to hear really phonemes very distinctly.",
            "And so there have been studies looking at.",

            "If you are interested in this topic is to look at babies who are premature.",
