            "And what the system now does it goes.",

            "Is this document belongs to the query or not?",

            "So we get a couple of labels and after that we start with the SVN active learning process so you can see this for example Now this.",
            "This is the.",

            "Yes, maybe some broadcasting company.",
            "Manufacturing intelligence sensors.",
            "So now we have a couple of labeled examples and now the system switches to SVM mode and it starts SVM active learning.",
            "So now it's speaking the documents for which it's almost unsure whether should it be wireless networks or not, and it's we provide the feedback by just clicking here, yes or no, so this is a way of training the system for what should the document be in the new concept so.",
            "I don't know, this looks like no.",
            "This looks like Paris Corporation.",
            "Yes, so this this depends on the how much time invested this is that determines the quality of the final concept.",
            "Once we are happy, just click finish and we get another concept here.",
            "So this is on and then another thing option is that you can.",
            "We have this thing called concept which you can preload the.",
            "If you have a vocabulary so one case of vocabulary would psych.",
            "So if you have a, if you're given vocabulary, then you can use that vocabulary to either name the concepts or to help discovery of the new sub concepts.",
            "So in this case you just have a.",
            "Some subset of 437.",
            "Keywords which were extracted from this asset from some finance domain.",
            "And they were each four behind each keyword.",

            "With this keyword annotate this document or not.",
            "So this is the.",
            "This is what this context means, and then we can go.",
            "For example, we can click on the banking trust financial.",
            "And we can ask, we can go here where you can change the name you say suggesting my name.",
            "And the based on the vocabulary we have commercial bank, commercial banking, community bank and so on.",
            "And so we select commercial banking.",
            "So this is 1 possibility.",
            "Another thing is let's say we want to add a couple of sub concepts here.",
            "We can use this vocabulary as a way of generating suggestions, so this the elements from the vocabulary possible new concepts.",
            "And we just say suggest give me top four suggestions.",
            "So now the system goes, checks for the documents, where would they classify in this vocabulary and brings the most relevant.",
            "Terms and for example, the top point.",
            "Things are software solution, wireless communications equipment manufacturer.",
            "So which would look in more details which is inside this concept you would actually see that it's quite nice.",
            "So this business segment for example is already.",
            "It's not quite the.",
            "Distinctive, so just don't add it so.",
            "In the appeal here, so this is.",
            "One way, and then one once another functionality is if you get new documents you can add them to this taxonomy.",
            "So just go file.",
            "We can include new documents, so basically we.",
            "Just select let's say we have in this case here.",
            "Prepare 5000 new documents.",
            "You click over and now the system is first training a classifier classifier for classifying into this ontology that readers just constructed.",
            "So this is training and then it loads all the documents in and classifieds them into this ontology.",
            "So this is the result.",
            "So let's say this.",
            "Producer of Alluminio is classified into manufacturing, for example.",
            "So and if you're not happy, we can also change the parameters here, so.",
            "Again, this.",
            "Will be.",
            "This bank Corporation was classified under banking loans so.",
            "Undress.",
            "Graphs, not only trees.",
            "So this will be the next step.",
            "OK, so I mean right now these relations here are just this sub concept of relations.",
            "So then another thing which will be showing today on the poster is if in some particular cases we have already.",
            "So if let's say have a.",
            "Stream of news articles and you extract from the stream the named entities and for which name entity you describe it by the sentences in which it appears.",
            "So this would be the context of the each name entity, and using that you can construct an ontology on a similar way as we did it now on top of finances.",
            "So in this case we use Reuters RC one corpora.",
            "Purposely extracted the name entities we followed name entities for one month and this is how they get clusters.",
            "Really get clusters in to sports people related to sports.",
            "Then did they get some clustered into people related to Formula One?",
            "So let's say this would be healed with narrow McLaren, so this was the data set is from 97 so.",
            "You go to tennis.",
            "You have him.",
            "He's some presence alone.",

            "We can also look at look for the Co occurrences of the name entities and then for each pair of name entities you can construct another profile.",
            "So you extract the text.",
            "Extracted so you describe each pair of entities by the sentences in which they appear, and using that you can check what would be.",
            "For example, if we.",
            "Go to Formula One and click relations here.",
            "We see that.",
            "Formula One, so the name entities from Formula One related to name entities from the business clusters.",
            "It could be here.",
            "And they are related to include important, so these are the keywords from there.",
            "Sentences today have in common infra which, so this is the next step would be that using this information here you could infer the possible links between so other kinds of links.",

            "You see it links to ministers Middle East.",

            "One more example would be car manufacturing, for example is linked to.",
            "Sports 'cause?",
            "The.",
            "I mean they sponsor lots of sports and have Formula One in sports and so on.",
            "So this would be the.",
            "So, but but for more details.",
            "So this is just how this this particular principle is plugged into this software.",
