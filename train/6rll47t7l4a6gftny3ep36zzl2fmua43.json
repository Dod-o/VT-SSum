            "This is highly nonlinear effect so you are right that you know on the on the clause that I showed right?",

            "As I said, many questions are open, so the only the only what we did.",
            "That's what I showed you.",

            "Does this depend on what property ordering you consider?",

            "If you can see that just the nanostructure itself are ribonucleic acid nanostructure without sort of embedding that in physiological solution.",
            "Then you know that goes great model that you would arrive with sort of, but again, you know in practice you of course have to account for this physiological solution where coarse graining may be different.",
            "May be different.",
