            "And then I have to multiply that by the probability that it was sunny in the 1st place, OK?",

            "Very nice.",

            "So for example, if I wanted to know what the probability is that I am 180 tall and that today is sunny, I would actually independently compute what the probability of being sunny is today and what the probability of me being 180 is today.",
            "And then I will just multiply the two and I'm done alright.",

OK, and then I sort of marginalized over the values that small see can take so small she can take other value bigc or Bixi bar OK, but I think if you look at the table is actually much easier than than the equations.",
