            "Very few people will actually go and sample the data that is available because why throw away the data if you can use it all however much more pertinent is the second part of the definition, which is a computer corpus, which is something that is encoded in a standardized and a homogeneous way for open ended retrieval tasks.",
            "So all the nouns here are in fact important.",
            "One is standardized, which means that whatever way you encode the corpus, hopefully it is according to some sort of standard format for encoding digital language data.",
            "Homogeneous way means that all the pieces of data that we have, all the text that we have should be encoded in the same way.",
            "Now this might kind of be obvious, but often it isn't, because what people do is that.",
            "For a bit of the data, they have quite a few more pieces of information than they have for the rest, and then include everything because it's a shame to throw away, but then kind of the whole corpus is a bit skewed.",
            "Yeah, for 10% of the corpus, you know, I don't know the name of the speaker and their sex, and when they were born, but for the other 90% you don't know it.",
