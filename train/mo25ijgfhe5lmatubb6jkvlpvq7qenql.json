            "Another interesting thing about catalogs and I'm going to bash catalogs in a minute.",
            "I'm not there yet, but when I bash catalogs, one thing to keep in mind is that catalogues when you make a set of imaging and you make a catalog out of it and put it in a SQL query database, you've done that with very specific scientific goals in mind.",

            "To make the image, and in fact, if you're hardcore, astronomers will never show you the deconvolved scene, they'll only show you the scene re convolved with a central point spread function because they don't believe there's a true scene.",
