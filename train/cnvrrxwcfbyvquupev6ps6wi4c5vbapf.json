            "I would suggest just looking.",
            "You look at certain key elements in here while this project failed and it tells you you just just because you use a technique doesn't mean it's guaranteed.",
            "I'm saying like we have a pragma technique.",
            "It works for us, but just using it isn't guaranteed for success.",
            "You've got to have the right approach behind it.",
            "Now there are parts of work in our field where we say, well yeah, this sort of agile type approach.",
            "Really we were doing it if we're developing new software is not new board, new software for the board.",
            "You're basically working through an agile type process to get it up and running.",
            "You're not worried about a full blown specific, nothing of that.",
            "Let's let's get it going that level.",
            "But in terms of system level I.",
            "People claiming to use it, but I haven't seen many examples.",
            "That's another problem in the in our world of getting concrete feedback.",
            "You have people say, Oh yes, here's a project that has succeeded.",
            "Actually, how succeeded, so not widely used at the present time.",
            "Lots of interest in it.",
            "My own view is you can use the agile type techniques at certain levels, but in the real time embedded.",
            "I'm talking on better work.",
            "It doesn't work like that, it doesn't, it just does not work and it's not to do with the technique is because you're part of the system.",
            "I'm sorry I can't give you that.",
            "We know the way things go, the way things operate when you're part of the system, we don't do it in the way that's seen by the people evolving have evolved agile and that clearly is much more.",
            "Sure, say.",
            "Much more important, when you've got.",
            "Like poorly defined or hasty defined specification.",
            "And it's a client who's saying, well, I think I'd like this and maybe if we should change that and very much human computer interaction.",
            "So I think there's lots of lots of qualities there.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Anne.",
            "There is 1 slide, which I thought I'd included.",
            "I've forgotten it was talked about.",

            "And as I said, the failure was not due to agile techniques.",
            "It was the way that the project was handled.",
            "Just forget it interest.",
            "It's quite difficult in our world to get hard statistics.",
            "But some years ago.",
            "Tom dimarco.",
            "Looked at software.",
            "And he went across a number of projects as listed down here and he brought it here.",
            "This is the way he broke it down.",
            "Into the major stages.",
            "And he looked at the percentage allocation.",
            "So.",
            "The thing is that you see here these projects.",
            "This set have very much in common.",
            "The one thing you can see the implementation, by the way this was originally collected in the 1970s, so you had very limited support for implementation, but it's very similar numbers.",
            "Such much there's no order code generation yet, so how long does it take to get into code and then getting it right?",
            "And again, you can see the similarities in numbers.",
            "Now what makes this different is if you take this particular one TRW.",
            "You say that they put much greater effort into requirements and design.",
            "And the consequence was that they had much lower percentage spent down here.",
            "Now, of course you could say, well yes, but it's still 100% all we've done is shifted the effort round.",
            "But actually, when you when you look at the absolute numbers, it was a whole.",
            "The whole project here was much shorter than similar ones, so they not only had this greater effort at requirements and design, it paid off at much less time at testing, right?",
            "This is a colleague of mine in Germany went to a company.",
            "And he said in this company there were three teams.",
            "And we've identified them as 1, two, and three.",
            "So it said this is what the company said the team three.",
            "They were the very first people to finish designing coding.",
            "So they are the first people ready.",
            "We are going to get into testing followed by team to follow up a team one.",
            "But when they looked out at integration, acceptance tests and delivery and otherwise.",
            "Deployement.",
            "It was team one was first.",
            "10 three were third.",
            "The other thing was the five year defect rate was highest for Team 3.",
            "And last for team one.",
            "Well, there are very few as a very few times we can get numbers in our industry.",
            "But every time we get numbers that's what comes out.",
            "The people who spend more time.",
            "Analyzing and designing are the people who spend less time testing and debugging who have the lowest defect rates, and that's a generalization.",
            "But it's a truism.",
            "Always try and backup RN.",
            "Our opinions with facts.",
            "Oh yes, if I can say this is something it's an old diagram.",
            "It's trying to illustrate the issue of making mistakes.",
            "And it starts off.",
            "Here is what the user thought he wanted, and that's also important.",
            "If you're dealing with GNU systems, what people think they want in the 1st place is not necessarily what at the end they said.",
            "What we really should have had, but then it goes through different phases of what the user actually said he wanted.",
            "So here we got a problem with the communication from the user.",
            "Well, we know what the system designers who say where we want it like this it goes down to design level.",
            "Turn something like that and when they handed over this it will now this is what I really wanted in the 1st place.",
            "So there are variations on this.",
            "There's an extra about producing a swing for a child, you know, but this is these are true.",
            "This is a problem and if you don't have feedback.",
            "If you don't have feedback between the different layers of people working on it, you are going to get this problem.",
            "Fact, not opinion.",
            "Right now this is a slider.",
            "Really wanted the source of software errors.",
            "This is based upon Dimarco's work, but also I have looked at more recent figures and they're not very much different.",
            "What you see there is the the biggie.",
            "The Big E is requirements.",
            "Most of our software errors come because we make mistakes in our requirements.",
            "The either the specification is given to you or your interpretation.",
            "Design is the next big one.",
            "How we get things wrong.",
            "And we usually have it.",
            "We have a dustbin thing for others.",
            "But notice that coding really contributes relatively few few in terms of the errors.",
            "If I then look at cost.",
            "You can see that now requirements is a huge thing and this is logical because I said earlier.",
            "If you make a mistake in requirements then runs down through every single stage onwards.",
            "So it's going to cost you money to change.",
            "And you can see the cost effects are coding is quite low now.",
            "Don't get me wrong and I'm not saying the coding level things are trivial.",
            "What I have observed and I this is just purely a personal observation and I have no figures to back it up.",
            "But I've observed that most of the problems which cause systems either to be totally cancelled to go very very late and go over budget to not work correctly or to come out with reduced functionality are requirements.",
            "Level problems.",
            "The issues that tend to cause serious problems like death in the end tend to be much more related to code level.",
            "So you've got.",
            "You gotta look at these two aspects to it.",
            "It's not that one should be saying, oh, I can neglect the code level because it's a small amount, no different emphasis, so I've got to do the right job.",
            "Point number one, and then I've got to do the job right.",
            "And how do I know I've done the job right?",
            "You're back to how do I do no good testing in any of these applications?",

            "An auto landing system on an aircraft.",
            "Something you fly off all around Europe and the world, and you rely upon these systems working.",
            "What's the failure rate requirement?",
            "Well, it's in excess of 10 -- 9.",
            "One failure in 10 to the minus nine operations.",
            "An aircraft cannot possibly do 1010 to 9 landings.",
            "So it's impossible to show that you meet this level.",
            "Of security of criticality.",
            "So you have to build quality in and once you start building quality and you find it can go everywhere, it just becomes natural.",
            "So that's the not only the build quality and use the correct tools.",
            "Look for it, analyze it and do the best you can and then test as best you can.",

            "A month or so afterwards, about 500 people were all contractors, lost their jobs straight away.",
            "They said, right, the whole project went on hold, so it's no fun losing a job.",
            "It took them six months to identify the problem.",
            "And it was caused by a numerical overflow.",
            "And there was.",
            "It was numbers coming in from a sensor on the vehicle.",

            "There was no way you could test for that because you see it was beyond the range they expected.",
            "So they tested for all the things they expected.",

            "So another example, by the way, of something that you couldn't have tested for some of you may remember only a few years ago there was a space mission to collect samples from their space on the return vehicle which had gathered these actual particles.",
            "It came back into the atmosphere and the plan was that when it wanted to come through the outer atmosphere it would an interdistrict past the stratosphere.",
