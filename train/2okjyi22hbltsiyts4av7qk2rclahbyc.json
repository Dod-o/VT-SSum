            "So the problem is that if you have a conventionally structured dictionary where you have dictionary entries and each entry is headed by Edward and the head word is like a single word thing, and then you have multi word phraseological things which you want to describe in your dictionary.",
            "So you're faced with the problem of where do I put them under which Edwards will.",
            "In which entry or should I promote them to the status of headwords and so on?",
            "So this is a problem that keeps coming back again and again in lexicography when dictionaries lived on paper, the problem was there and our diction.",
            "There is mostly live on computer screens, but the problem is still there.",
            "So I just want to what I want to do in my presentation is I want to kind of analyze the problem a little bit and describe some of the solutions that people conventionally usually employ in dictionaries for solving the problem.",
            "And then I'm going to propose my own solution.",
            "And then in the second half of my presentation I want to show you how I have implemented my solution in a dictionary writing system called Laksana Me.",
            "So there's slightly more theoretical part at the beginning, and the more practical part almost like a software demo in the second half of my press."
        ],
        [
            "Station.",
            "So if you have a phraseological multiword item, like third time lucky, there is this perennial question in lexicography that keeps coming back again and again is.",
            "Where do you include this in your dictionary, or does it go under the headword which had?",
            "Where does it come under third or time?",
            "Or lucky, or all of them, or two of them, or neither of them?",
            "Do you perhaps treat treat this as a headwords itself, and so on?",
            "So yeah.",
            "There's there's like 3 typical solutions to this problem.",
            "Solution number one is that you just pick one of these.",
            "You you decide for some reason that you're going to have this phraseological item described under the HEADWORD for 3rd, let's say just say nothing about it underneath the other ones.",
            "Obviously we will probably all agree that that's not ideal becausw, that's not necessarily where the users might be looking for it.",
            "Another another solution solution #2, which is really a variation of solution number one is that you include the item under one of the three possible headwords and then under the other two you just have some sort of a cross reference.",
            "You say third time lucky see under third.",
            "That's a little bit better, but obviously that's not ideal either.",
            "Becausw dictionaries are things that people use while they do something else, so the people post.",
            "Probably people might appreciate having the entire information there on the screen.",
            "Without having to navigate to other entries and finding the location in the target entry where this multi word item is actually described, and so on, and the solution #3 that you often see in born digital dictionaries is that the whole thing is promoted to the status of ahead word.",
            "So you you have a dictionary article in your dictionary and had word is third time lucky.",
            "So strictly speaking it's not ahead word, it's like had multi word, but the terminology is irrelevant.",
            "You have these things at the same level as all the other entries.",
            "That seems like this is the solution to the problem, and people sometimes tell you things like.",
            "Well, this is wonderful because we now have digital dictionaries, so we don't actually have to answer that question.",
            "We can treat this as a headward and we just delegate the responsibility for locating this particular entry to the search algorithm that we have on our dictionary website.",
            "So the end user comes in and the end user searches for, let's say, in the headward time or the string time.",
            "So they are given a list of results and somewhere.",
            "Among the list of results they will have the entry for third time.",
            "Lucky this seems like it's the solution to the problem, but I think it's not becausw.",
            "Because you're delegating the responsibility for showing the entry to the search algorithm, the lexicographer no longer has control over where in the listing of results this particular entry will appear.",
            "Will it be somewhere underneath the end the entry for time?",
            "Will it be somewhere on the right hand side of the screen?",
            "Or maybe the search algorithm is not clever at all?",
            "It's probably will not be listed at all, so you know, as a lexicographer you probably want to have some control over where this item will appear.",
            "If you're including an entry like this under the headword for time, you probably want it to appear under one specific sense of time and not just at the end of the entire entry.",
            "OK, so all the solutions that people conventionally use are not ideal, and I think the ideal answer to the question.",
            "Under which Headward should this be included?",
            "I think the ideal answer is it should be included under all of them becausw.",
            "Because why not?",
            "You know, that's where people might be looking for it.",
            "That's why users might appreciate seeing it, so why not?",
            "Why not all of them?",
            "Why do we have to decide?",
            "So if we want to include a phraseological subentry like this under three different headwords, the only way to do that in a conventional dictionary, including born digital dictionaries, is to just copy and paste.",
            "So we have three separate copies in three separate places, and again, you will probably agree with me that that's not ideal, because that's an invitation for inconsistency.",
            "If six months later, one of your lexicographers goes in and adds a usage example to the entry for third time, lucky under the headword.",
            "Third, there is no implicit automated way to make sure that the same changes also made under the other head words.",
            "OK, so just keeping several copies of what essentially is the same thing in several different places is not great either."
        ],
        [
            "So that's not a solution either.",
            "So why is this a problem?",
            "The problem is that the dictionaries that we write, the dictionary articles that we write, our tree structures.",
            "We obviously dictionary articles originated on paper, then they kind of migrated to computer screens to dictionary writing systems and we started modeling dictionary entries or encoding dictionary entries in XML.",
            "XML is a great markup language for documents and things that kind of look like documents and every dictionary entry is kind of like a small document, but it's it's a tree.",
            "OK, so it it's a tree, doesn't allow you to have.",
            "One item appear in two separate places.",
            "You can always only have a phraseological subentry, which has only one parent.",
            "OK, so XML or a tree XML is a tree structure, which means every element has.",
            "Only one parent and a certain number of child elements.",
            "So for example, a phraseological subentry has only one sense parent.",
            "It cannot have more than two.",
            "OK, that is the problem.",
            "That's that's what is preventing us from including third time lucky under third antimon lucky while just having one sub entry for these things and not actually keeping separate copies in separate places.",
            "So how do we fix this?",
            "One solution that you sometimes come across?",
            "In literature and in sort of experimental dictionaries is that we migrate from trees to graphs.",
            "Becausw graphs are kind of multi dimensional structures where elements can have more, can have different kinds of relations to other elements.",
            "In XML you only have the relation between parent and child and every child can have up to one parent.",
            "But in a graph you can have lots of different relations with lots of different semantics not not only parent child but but all sorts of different things.",
            "So just migrating dictionaries from trees to graphs would seem like a good solution to the problem, But the problem with graphs is that they are probably way too complicated for for for humans to kind of mentally grasp in their heads.",
            "If you look at the two dimensional tree structure that we have in XML, it's easy to show it on a screen and what you're looking at on your screen you you're kind of your XML tree.",
            "That that's what you're looking at is the entire story.",
            "There is nothing else.",
            "OK, you don't have to manipulate a complicated multi dimensional data structure in your head.",
            "You what you see is what you have there.",
            "So trees are kind of very intuitively easy for humans to work with.",
            "Far as graphs are kind of hugely overcomplicated and we don't really have very good user interfaces for editing graphs and just people.",
            "That's probably the reason why graphs haven't really taken off.",
            "As a as an encoding kind of formalism for dictionaries that most of the dictionaries that people write today are trees encoded in XML, so I wanted to solve the problem in a clever way.",
            "So instead of just keeping separate copies of a phraseological subentry in in three separate entries, I."

        [
            "Assaulted me, maybe we could find some sort of a compromise solution between trees and graphs so that you know instead of having two 2 copies of what I think is the same thing, just having one and having it kind of linked into the the XML tree where where it should appear.",
            "So what I'm proposing is not that we migrate from trees to graphs, but that we kind of augment our trees a little bit so they begin resembling graphs a little bit.",
            "So all our dictionary entries will continue to be trees, but every now and then certain elements will be allowed to have more than one parent.",
