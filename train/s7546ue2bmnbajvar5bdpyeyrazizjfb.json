            "The last time we quickly went through environmental risk assessment, but since it's a very important topic, I just want to quickly go through it again for those who weren't here and for those who may be.",
            "Slept through it.",
            "Anyway, the.",
            "The point of environmental risk assessment is to integrate all the knowledge from two different fields.",
            "First is environmental chemistry, so all the chemical information that we have about a pollutant, including where it is in which environmental compartment, how it transports from one to the other, how fast it degrades, and what are the conditions under which it degrades.",
            "So its half-life and the way of degradation.",
            "And these are all the chemical information that we then used to obtain the predicted environmental concentrations.",
            "Another way of doing this, especially for chemicals who have not yet been introduced into the environment, is to have modeling numerical modeling too.",
            "Assess or to predict how much it will be in the environment, so that's the chemical part of environmental risk assessment, and then we have the biological parts.",
            "So the ecotoxicological tests.",
            "Basically we use them on as many species as we can on as many trophic levels and lifecycle stages as we can so that we get enough information in order to choose the one that's most sensitive.",
            "And this most sensitive species is then used to calculate the predicted no effect.",
            "Concentrations, the pinek concentrations and those are the ones that we think based on all the knowledge that we've obtained from these tests, will not have a deleterious harmful effect on the environmental organisms.",
            "So those that live in this environment, that's going to be polluted.",
            "And then the only thing that we do with this whole range of knowledge is we divide the pack values, the predicted environmental concentrations with the pinek values with predicted no effect concentrations and then we get the so called.",
            "Back by neck ratio, this is the information that regulatory bodies want from from the environmental risk assessment.",
            "In order to be able to say if this is.",
            "A dangerous or potentially harmful chemical or not, and that's in the end.",
            "All that we actually do.",
            "Just give 1 number.",
            "Of course, this is a number with a certain interval of confidence interval.",
            "It's not just you have many errors that compound many uncertainties that compound, but in the end more or less the pack pinek ratio is what you then give as a result to those who are the decision makers.",
            "So those who then decide if this substance is going to be used or if it's used will be terminated or if another one would be used and so forth.",
            "So this is the intention of the environmental risk assessment.",
            "So if I told you that.",
            "From an ecotoxicity test Chronicle test on some Organism, the EC 50 value, so the effect concentration, for example on reproduction or growth was 100 PPM and another for another Organism was 10, which is the more sensitive.",
            "And why?",
            "It's an easy question.",
            "So you have one Organism that has an effect concentration EC 50 value of 100 and another Organism with this easy 50 value of 10.",
            "Yes why?",
            "Because it has an effect at a lower concentration, so the one that we would use of these two for the environmental risk assessment would be.",
            "The 10 one, the lower one because we trying to find the lowest possible effect you remember.",
            "I showed you the slides last time of an example of environmental risk assessment where we did several tests on.",
            "I suppose earthworms and Clover so plant as well, and what we got was the lowest value was for, I suppose.",
            "So.",
            "Woodlice avoidance and this is the value that we then used for calculating the environmental risk assessment.",
            "The way to get from the.",
            "Easy or low economic value.",
            "You remember these terms?",
            "Loic lowest observed effect concentration and NOAC is the no observed effect concentration.",
            "So the way to get to the pinek then is to divide this lowest value with a risk factor of our choosing an this is where a lot of uncertainty happens in environmental risk assessment because someone an expert in this field hopefully.",
            "Has to decide.",
            "How sensitive to make this peanut value?",
            "So how low to go?",
            "He uses the lowest value available, but then you can either use EC 50 and divide it with something, or you can use low economic values and divide and so it's a judgement call based on the previous knowledge that people have.",
            "So this is where a lot of uncertainty then happens in environmental risk assessment.",
            "So this was the quick.",
