            "In research for one sense, that's good because it shows that what's done in this community is getting traction outside research, and it's getting to society into the market.",
            "On the other hand, sometimes it's bad because we did all the research and the big players take the credits and the money.",

            "That's the web pages correct?",

            "What do people care about?",
            "OK, the top players in soccer and the Formula One racers.",
