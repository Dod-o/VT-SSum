            "Like a process which allows us to find the regions of the scene, which kind of stand out from the surroundings.",
            "And so we we formulate the spatial anomaly detection problem as a saliency detection problem, and use the discriminants centers around saliency framework to detect regions that are salient and in this framework, saliency is defined as the extent to which the region containing the location can be differentiated from its surroundings.",
            "For example, if I want to compute the saliency at this location, what would be done?",
            "Is like we would consider two spatial temporal windows, one containing the region which we term as the center, with label one and a surrounding annular region in green, which is the containing the background with labels equal to 0 and then we extract some features Y from the center and this around and see if the features are able to discriminate the center from this around well.",

            "Then the center would be very different from the surround according to this feature set.",
            "So the way we quantized that is using the mutual information between the feature Y and the class label C. So if this mutual information is high, that means that the center is very different from this around, so the mutual information expression involves computing the KL divergences between the class conditional distributions for feature Y and the marginal for that feature."
