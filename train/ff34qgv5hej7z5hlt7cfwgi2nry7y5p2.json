            "If you can comment on this.",
            "Sure, another question, yeah.",

            "But the next step that we are already working on is to develop like a site where the data publisher can continuously look at this measurements and so that whenever she improves the links then everything is re computed and in the same way that data the measurement should be re computed whenever other datasets are updated.",

            "A useful that it extra interlinking data set is, but then you have like a separate data set.",
            "You have to check, so actually that's that's so our solution is independent to where the data is or how the data is stored, so we assume the typical case where you have a data set.",
            "The links have been generated with hillclimbs or whatever whatever tool and when you have the links in the data set you can of course extract what you mention is whether we could go directly to an interlinking repository.",
            "And start taking all the datasets that are there linked and start the process from there.",
            "Yeah, we can do it in the same way that's it's.",
            "It's something independent from where the data is.",

            "So yeah, it is also useful to have link repositories, of course.",
            "Yeah, another question is when you compare the source entity with the target one in the target entity.",

            "Something maybe not explicitly stated there, but can be derived and this may add value to your source entity.",
            "Definitely so we we didn't do any inference at all, so right now it's just the data that it's explicitly stated.",
            "But yes, it would definitely be interested.",
            "Interesting so.",
            "You analyzed, you said you analyzed 35 datasets.",
            "Well, in the in the Elody cloud.",
            "There's kind of a huge number of bubbles.",
            "So how do you generalize from your results?",
            "So the way we wanted to do it was to ensure that we got a different domains and so on, and the different bubbles were around 1044.",
            "When we looked at the link data crawl and we in the end decided to go for this because they had many links and many types of links.",
            "We found out that many datasets didn't contain links because you can be in the cloud.",
            "Also, if you are like being pointed to and so on an.",
            "There's this restriction of having only 50 links, and then you already in the cloud, so we really wanted to look at the data sets that had many entities and many links.",
            "So we just decided to do the analysis like this, but in theory the the results are general enough because we looked at several domains and different providers and different types of entities, so we could just keep on running it on on more datasets.",
            "Any other question, yes.",
            "So I understand that redundancy may be something to avoid in many situations, but in some other situations, for example in some task it may be useful to ever redundant information.",
            "So I was wondering if in this description of the gain of the value that you give about perspective linking, you may provide like a more neutral profile with some of the property that you would gain so you can show.",
            "If I'm interested in redundant team formation, I can decide that that's good to you, I'm just.",
            "Wondering what's your thoughts about this more neutral?",
            "Yeah, so that's actually very important point.",
            "So what we do with this measurements is just to give the current analysis of the data to the data publisher.",
            "By no means we want to say this is bad or good, we just want to give a tool for measuring an so that when they make changes they can see whether in their terms is better or worse.",
            "But it's up to the data publisher to afterwards.",
            "Define how to so the direction to take.",
            "I mean something like trying to get homogeneous gain in all entities.",
            "I think it's something that we could all agree on, but then if you want to, for example, create many links between 2 two entities, because I don't know you want to really specify many types of relationships there, the entity connectivity will signal.",
            "Obviously redundancy, but it might be interesting for the data publisher, so I completely agree we we we give the measurements in a neutral way.",
            "We don't give a fundamental assessment.",
            "Hi Sam your work is quite a really nice work and I think.",
            "I think I would like to use it, but I have one main question so.",
            "As far as I understand you do not check the accuracy of the links right of the house, same as, but if you have a lot of mistakes in these linking, I guess you have a big gain, right?",
            "Or am I wrong so not necessary, but it can happen.",
            "So for example if you do have the Swiss coblence same as the German coblence, obviously you will probably have different locations, different majors and so on.",
            "And you do have a.",
            "Big enrichment, yes, it's true, but so the point of these measurements is basically to give another point of view to the to the link quality assessment.",
            "So you would have, like all the dimensions like this survey paper, collecting all the dimensions about quality assurance in the case of links still holds that you have to check the semantic accuracy, and for this actually.",
            "We also worked on another work on crowdsourcing, so the idea would be you can check the accuracy with crowdsourcing and then you can also check this kind of gain.",
            "So just as another dimension.",
            "It just so confused.",
            "So am big gain does not really tell me much whether I could trust what happens or not, right?",
            "So I have to really, really look at it a second time.",
            "Yeah, so actually I I really see it as a as a separate dimension, so it's it's something that show it's like availability I I don't.",
            "I don't think it's a good thing to say that the gain is a proxy for semantic accuracies.",
            "It's just like another glasses for the data and for evaluating the links.",
            "Any other question, yes.",
            "Do you consider multihop when you?",
            "Check the same as links because you have the others and then the publications.",
            "And let's say that the publications also are the same.",
            "But I would say that there's not much information there because it doesn't add much better publications itself might have different attributes and more information you consider it as better or not under check this or or not at the moment.",
            "So we have we have discussed about that, but so very often data consumers also only try to consume one hub.",
            "So we decided to do it as a first piece of work, like with only one hop.",
            "But it's just very easily extendable.",
            "So yes, it's true that it's another improvement that we could do as the same as the inference.",
            "Any other question?",
