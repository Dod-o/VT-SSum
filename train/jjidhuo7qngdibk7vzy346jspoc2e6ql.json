            "Just a little bit of background and context to start with, and then the motivation behind our work and the requirements that we developed in the process over the last six months or so.",

            "And then I'm going to go over the Latvia pilot solution.",

            "So the whole concept of the single window started with the UN Recommendation 33 back in 2005, and since then there have been a number of international initiatives, notably the World Customs Organization produced their data model around a similar time, and the APEC and ASEAN communities have taken on board the UN single window concept and have been working towards similar.",
            "Initiatives in their own regions.",
            "For example, the Asian single window they hope to create an environment where national single windows can operate and integrate within those communities, and they also hope to include banking and insurance.",
            "APEC's got a similar system, leaving to establishing links between their national single windows.",
            "On an EU level we have two main driving forces.",

            "Net requirements are driving maritime transport, single windows, a lot of Member States now have national SSN or safety net applications to handle the file forms and port control reporting, and then of course we have.",

            "So the motivation behind this really is that currently regulation and transport formalities, opposing barriers to efficient trade.",

            "As we've been discussing earlier.",

            "I think some of the names are very slightly different so this is the latest cutting edge version which was changed based on some discussions we had earlier this week.",
            "So I'll explain the changes as we go along.",
            "First of all, for any transport operation, we have some sort of business that needs to report to authorities.",
            "We have.",
            "We've categorized five categories of authorities, mode specific searail, maritime authorities, and so on.",
            "Border control and Immigration Customs is the biggest one.",
            "Perhaps food and veterinary and safety and security services such as security police and emergency medical response units and things like that.",
            "And we've developed this common Reporting Gateway, abbreviated to CRG, which acts as a reporting point for all of these authorities, regardless of mode.",
            "On the way, the common reporting Gateway works is whether you're reporting for customs purposes or road or rail.",
            "You use the same interface in every country.",
            "And you report in the format of the common regulatory schema or CRS.",
            "Sorry to overload you with all the acronyms, so the common regulatory schema defines in a mode neutral sense, all the information that is required for transport regulation in the EU.",
            "So using this configurable format anybody can report to any authority in any country and they use the same format for everything.",
            "This information is then submitted to a second module which we are developing called the information exchange and this really represents the core of what we're producing.",
            "A system to distribute the data to the authorities.",
            "It also provides notifications.",
            "It provides responses back to the reporting party, and it's also able to intelligently analyze the data that it has received and generate further alerts and notifications.",
            "It also allows authorities to send extra information to each other.",
            "For example, if one authority, for example, the security police have noticed an anomaly.",
            "They can make relevant Port Authority, for example, aware of any incoming threat.",
            "And we call these two concepts together.",
            "The next generation national single window.",
            "And there will be one of these for each Member State.",
            "So within a Member State, businesses use the next generation national single window to report to all authorities, including customs, regardless of what is being transported and how it is being transported.",
            "And then we had some discussion about the common reporting gateway.",
            "There were some partners that weren't happy with a single reporting interface that wasn't in their control.",
            "For example port based in the Netherlands raised the point that there already well established system essentially is acting as a single window.",
            "Why do they need to receive the information second hand?",
            "So we came up with the possibility to design the common reporting gateway in such a way that it could be distributed within the Member State so they can actually be more than one common reporting gateway.",
            "And I'll talk a little bit more about how that works later on, so this is the situation within a Member State and supporting that we have a number of other modules which exist at an EU level.",
            "We have a central central register of the common reporting gateways, so this gives the business is the address of where to find the reporting point for that country.",
            "So probably a web address.",
            "There is also an EU level information exchange which works in the same way as the national level, but it allows exchange of information from country to country and also to use systems such as safety net and traces and any other systems like that which will be developed in the future.",
            "And then this is probably possibly the most important component.",
            "Manage regulatory information changes the nature of regulations is a highly dynamic, and often updates regulations.",
            "New legislation coming in.",
            "And these these components, the common reporting gateway in the information exchange aren't any use unless they can be updated efficiently and quickly when regulations change.",
            "So what we've produced or what we will produce is a system by which applications distributed across the EU can be updated from a central point automatically, and this is down to the fact that the applications are based on the framework and changed the framework, and a central location is automatically propagated to changes in the applications.",
            "On a national level.",
            "And finally, with all this information stored around the place, there is a lot of potential for generating extra extra statistics and alerts and databases.",
            "For example, an EU ships database or environmental statistics and so on.",
            "So, and what we've called this.",
            "It was originally called in the paper a next generation EU single window, but after some discussions we decided that actually this name is perhaps a bit misleading, so this collection of services is now called the Central EU National Single Window Support Services."

        [
            "And this is how it functions.",

        ],
        [
            "So just to go into a little bit more detail, what these components do, the Information Services provides inherent capability to provide additional services, such as statistical information through data mining and data Fusion and databases.",
            "For example, a database of registered operators within the EU or within particular countries and ship database, maybe to rival the Lloyds Register.",
            "The Central Register of CRG's actors and address book for businesses to look up where they need to report it also allows Member States to register their software systems when they come online and make changes to the contact details.",
            "This component, as we've said, allows the utilaj changes an essential location, and then the national single window applications are updated automatically.",
