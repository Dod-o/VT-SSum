            "You can see that they vary in the types of things that they wear, like some people have helmets, keycaps pirate hats, they might be wearing dresses or pants which changes the structure of the lower half of their body.",
            "Additionally, they interact with objects which can cause occlusion, or they might be truncated by the image boundary.",

            "But the types of structural variation that we're considering here can't simply be captured by deformations of a single structural model.",
            "Really, what we need is a model that's able to capture several different types of structures.",
            "So over the past couple of years, we've looked at some mixture models.",
            "Which sort of go in this direction a little bit, but there's a question of can we simply scale up the number of mixture components in order to solve the problem?",
