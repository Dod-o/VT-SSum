            "Knowledge management within large enterprises.",
            "Accenture and I guess we will show some of the demos as well.",

            "Super enjoy.",
            "Great, otherwise it's our old friend colleague back from seemed fine when I spent some time in at CMU and after CMU he too much when directly through Accenture and laps and stay there so essential apps is sort of small unit with lots of research freedom.",
            "I think within Accenture doing interesting trying to implement interesting ideas which.",
            "Mike gets in into life after some time and rate leads group of researchers working in the area of machine learning, data mining and related topics.",

            "Thanks thanks Marco.",
            "So it is shifting a little back tomorrow active related topics, but I try and do is start off by more traditional collaboration knowledge management topics.",
            "See tell you guys what we're doing in active.",
            "That's that's in this space, but also then move a little bit away from active and see where we could go, potentially in the slightly longer term, using some of the techniques we talked about.",
            "So is Marcus had Accenture?",
            "Is large consulting companies an the lab we have is sort of an interesting mixture of different areas we focus on, but there is common and like any other, any research lab you know we're doing interesting things with the hope of someday being relevant to somebody.",
            "And and so one of the things we want to show here is is some of the things here are fairly short term.",
            "There's still researching, but you can apply them today.",
            "So knowledge management in the areas where there's been a lot of work done in academia, but it's been focused on the web, so everything in IR is really about the web, because the web is accessible to everyone to every researcher, to every University, every student.",

            "You can't have a general function that you can apply everywhere.",
            "Is also a lot more structured data databases that on the web they do exist, but.",

            "That's a separate thing, right?",
            "But in an enterprise you're often trying to combine the two things you don't have documents only, but you've got objects in a document, and the objects have some structure and they have some database information about them.",
            "So another another big difference.",
            "Amort of an interesting differences is different versions of a document.",

            "The update that page so that next time you go there the pages change.",

            "And doing IR on that, just doing redundancy and checking if the same thing it becomes.",
            "It becomes different because you are retreiving similar things that are exactly the same topic, but you have to take into account recency.",
            "Thing another thing or the people who who work in enterprises, you know the expectations are very different from the web.",
            "So on the web you're often looking for a document and there are many documents that will satisfy your information need because you might be looking for.",
            "In a population of Ljubljana, right?",
            "And there's many documents that have that information, so you're not looking for the single document that's going to answer your question and enterprise.",
            "Often you're looking for that document.",
            "It's the document versus in one of these will do so given the scale is smaller.",
            "And then you're also trying to find one thing, it becomes extremely hard.",
            "Another difference is redundancy, again, which is related to expectations that there is not that much redundancy.",
            "You can't rely on different people giving you similar things, and to make up for for the inaccuracy in your IR system.",
            "It's not not that interesting, but where security and access control there's.",
            "There's the usual, you know you need to have roles and logins and things like that.",
            "Don't care about that, but there's an interesting notion of people don't share things because sometimes there are different levels of information they can share.",
            "So if you've got a document that you worked on with some other company, you cannot release it publicly.",
            "You cannot sometimes release it to somebody else in the company without divulging.",
            "Who the company you work with was.",
            "So let's say if I was doing a project with with British Telecom, I may have signed an agreement that I can't tell anyone else in the company I work with this company with British Telecom, so I have to now scrub this document not only with any occurrence of the word British Telecom, but any other information that might allow them to infer that this was done with British Telecom.",
            "And that creates a huge problem because people just don't share information, they just keep it to themselves instead of doing all the work of cleaning and scrubbing.",
            "Another thing that we know a lot about Anna in an enterprise is who are the users?",
            "What are their roles?",
            "What are they doing?",
            "Day-to-day well sort of context.",

            "You have some context, but it's fairly unstructured unless you're doing.",
            "Are you putting a lot of cookies and you're actually asking people for very structured information?",
            "You really inferring it based on their their click path, and that's that.",
            "May be inaccurate.",
            "Version, enterprise, you know very accurately you have a database about every person that you know.",

            "You also know what are the big tasks people do.",
            "So if you know that people have 20 things that they end up doing, if you know their context in their role, you can restrict yourself to.",
            "I want to support 80% of the things that happen and I can start building specific applications that support that instead of the one.",
            "One application fits all Google box that I just click on search and hope that it gives me the right answer, so that's that's extremely important and the last of two things are the things we're focusing on a lot in active, but all other things are things that are going on.",

            "The longest one can be hundreds of pages.",

            "People are not going to be able to find anything, even if the best result isn't the first one.",

            "Can you tell me what you're trying to do?",
            "Or can I infer that either way, once if I can figure it out, great if you can tell me, even better.",
            "But often again, I said we know who the people are.",
            "Everybody has to log into an enterprise system, so there's no uncertainty as to who this person is, what their role is, what they do.",
            "Can I give them more concrete information that they need at that moment based on their context, and based on their the task they're trying to do?",
            "That's another area they're focusing on.",
            "The third one.",
            "Is a lot of times when people are using these.",

            "Version 1.1 one point 1A and we do track changes with word or and it's horrible.",
            "It should be a better way of doing that and then one of the big things that happens when you're writing with twenty other people is things get inserted that you just don't even notice sometimes, and there's a big need for tools that help you review these documents for certain things.",
