            "Now if you can get a model.",
            "Then you can compare the outputs from the model with the outputs of the actual engine as it's running, and the difference between the two, which is can be termed the residuals will tell you something about how the engine is operating.",

            "The very for the new European drive cycle for for type approval.",
            "So what we did was we took the same cycle.",
            "And we did it over a much shared period of time to speed up the inputs and make it more dynamic.",
            "Where do we get the factor of 1.7?",
            "We got that from the new European drive cycle.",
            "We went back and we said where is the speed varying most rapidly first gear.",
            "And we looked roughly at the time and we said, how much do we need to speed that up to make it move as dynamically as in European drive cycle?",
            "So I'll call this.",
            "We've given it very soon.",
            "Just call it the Queen cycle.",

            "We collected all the data, we've built a neural network model and there it is under normal operation and it's not one of the this is taken months of work.",
            "Anne.",

            "It's a 99% confidence interval.",
            "You would expect 1% of them to go outside OK. We also use it for fault detection and again the same idea.",
            "We took the model generated using the fast kemick cycle or the Queen Cycle.",

            "This is the bottom line on the bottom line is that having taken the fast drive cycle, this speeded up kemick and build a model.",
            "We then took that model.",
            "Yeah, we put it into the engine management unit.",
