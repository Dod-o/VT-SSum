            "There are there must be benefits that they are getting from using those pieces of owl and understanding those benefits would be very helpful to me in thinking about where owl should go.",

            "But I don't know that that's always true.",
            "I guess I was thinking of the saying that.",
            "Pardon.",
            "Oh yeah, OK, I know.",
            "I was thinking that you know people used to say nobody ever got fired for buying IBM.",
            "Alright, so today I guess one of the points I'll come back to it.",
            "I'm trying to make is that you know all is like the default choice and nobody in a research group is going to be, you know, kind of thought.",
            "Poorly fired for saying, oh let's use our for our knowledge, knowledge, representation system and it may or may not be the right choice on other other grounds, but they don't have to say let's use a knowledge representation system, right?",
            "They could say let's use it database or let's use a triple store.",
            "Right, so even that first decision to use a knowledge representation decision, a system implies that there is something of value, and it may be irrational.",
            "Yeah, that may be irrational too.",
            "Is a triple store not a knowledge representation system?",
            "Well, if you haven't put any owl into it, right, is it?",
            "Again, this is my question, right?",
            "What is being right I?",
            "I work in areas where there's tons of use in making lots of very big triple stores, but we never put any owl in, so I'm curious about what kind of owl actually gets put into knowledge representation systems right now, because people think that it helps them.",
            "And the answer is probably to be honest, we really don't know.",
            "So what what I hear is only from from clients.",
            "And interested parties that come to us and say we are not sacrificed without because we can't even do simple things so that I have some anecdotal evidence, but I'm, I guess you absolutely correct.",
            "So unless we we do some really thorough investigation about what people are using, we will not know for quite awhile now.",
            "Also, I agree, it's true that a lot of these applications using relatively simple languages, but I mean what they tend to do is actually push a lot of the intended meaning just into natural language semantics on the.",
            "On the tags on the names of the properties.",
            "Well then you know you can get so far with that, but you could then potentially increase the value of the system by adding an ontology that tries to allow you to understand a little bit more about what the the the edges, the properties actually mean.",
            "And you can you know you can use some small fragments vowel to do that, or you can get more ambitious.",
            "It's up to you your phrasing that again and sort of speculative way you could do this would would get this benefit.",
            "So I'm sorry I'm looking for evidence.",
            "Rap to ground.",
            "Some of this speculation, but I'll stop there.",
            "But other people take a turn.",
            "No, I go back to the topic which was interrupted.",
            "OK yeah, this topic and related topic.",
            "I think there are a couple of points and that I would like to make comments on.",
            "So first line way is good.",
            "Yes it is.",
            "I think the profiles are quite line way.",
            "I mean if you look at RDF RDF's you know Intermine checking is NP complete, but if you look at the profile that you have in out to, you know that polynomial time or even lock spacer is much better in that expect the other point.",
            "People make about applications.",
            "Well, I don't agree that you know you have allocations only in the buying from Attic to mind, you know and their application for the web as well.",
            "You know data integration if if one thing that you could.",
            "Do without an A good thing for for that out too, and the profile is that you could actually have a good connection between the full language and the profile.",
            "For example, you could allow users to build up LDL out two applications on Teologi is now the music ontologies in LDL, and then you could use.",

            "Allows you to deal with millions or even hundreds of millions of data.",
            "So I think even in the web or the semantic Web, you could find good applications and we do have some demonstration about how to make use of an Audi ontologies to build up, you know, semantic Web data integration applications.",
            "Even in this conference, thanks.",
            "So I have to go back to to this discussion with Jim and Frank also.",
            "It's clear that within the altar group we had some major discussions an I would probably not put in public.",
            "Some of the mayors between me and be John Aurion for example, so it was really a big discussion, but I do believe that the direction we took in the case of SRL was, you know, it was really the direction that was made with those types of applications that.",
            "That they are talking about and.",
            "The result is such that I made an implementation of SRL in about two or three afternoons in Python.",
            "It's not the world's most efficient implementation, obviously, but for smaller cases it just works and you can do it in no time and and you know, I don't have to go through any complicated logic sinks, and this is exactly the type of direction that was there now.",
            "My other answer would be the document will be out as as what we oficially call last call, probably before the end of the year or hopefully before the year before the end of the year.",
            "Please, that's the time to be more constructive in giving us comments on on where we have to draw the line and exactly but what we have now those exactly done with that one.",
            "And you know, as I said, God knows how much fight it costed us.",
            "Yeah, and just to sort of follow up a bit on that and what Jean said.",
            "Obviously what we did was spend a hell of a lot of time trying to find a good fragmente that into which all of these applications that Jim and Frank were talking about.",
            "Or as many as possible would fit.",
            "But I mean, we obviously didn't want to define 20 different fragments for each one of the little bits at all of these different applications are using, nor did we want to pick one gratuitously smaller bitten.",
            "From one of these twenty and four's everyone to use that so you know we spent quite a lot of time just finding this fragment that into which these guys fit and that didn't really cause you any extra pain by having that extra expressive power available.",
            "And I don't think either having 20 fragments or forcing everyone to use some arbitrary fragmente would have been a very good marketing ploy either.",
            "OK, so I mean obviously whoever is writing the primers have pressure and maybe going to make like a little sort of you know, owl, two fragments select or to really help your average Ruby or God help you.",

            "I think for me, because it's actually not advertising work.",
            "That's actually data work.",
            "It seems like what we have as a community as a whole is we have a whole lot of anecdotal evidence, and I'm not even sure where most of that anecdotal evidence is written down at maybe suyo, maybe some other places, but it seems like it would be good if we move to sort of statistical data driven methods to see where the property is actually being used.",
            "We have like 30, I mean five or six at least.",
            "Semi functional semantic web search engines.",
            "With indices, so we should be able to get this data pretty easily and I I'm not.",
            "I'm sort of surprised.",
            "Maybe this hasn't already been done.",
            "It has OK. What are the papers I've seen?",
            "I've seen some sort of out of date one, but we need to have this sort of update and then this stage of development process kept in line with working group work.",
            "I think that's obvious.",

            "Because I'm semantic web, it's really easy to release a billion crappy crap.",
            "Lee modeled KR pages which use one attribute.",

            "To figure out well, you know this is the sort of way, though differently, so this is something which is actually being used, has a lot of users, has a substantial effort involved, like this particular ontology in way that differently than maybe one ontology which is been used by tons of people and producing this happen manner.",
            "So maybe you can give us more.",

            "Yeah you have to sit forward to the microphone.",
            "I'm just saying that perhaps we should actually answer that because he's looked at Al ontologies and how they are composed in what they're being used for.",

            "OK, I'm not going to argue this time about the applicability of the DIO fragments, but will write some simple issue from practical point of view.",
            "There are some features of our which I call them performance skewers.",
            "Closeout two very simple examples are the reflexivity of same S and the fact that each UI for each UI a system should be able to infer that it is of a type resource, which is a feature actually.",
            "So these features are obviously relevant and makes sense.",
            "Theoretically speaking, they make the semantics well formed.",
            "I'm not saying that it is a bad thing for our same as to be.",
            "Reflexive is perfectly fine, but it puts extra burden that there are several features like this which put extra burden on any implementation.",
            "Doesn't matter whether it's going to be forward, chaining, backward chaining, whatever.",
            "There there just these two examples give you 2 extra 3 post per each node that should be considered by a system.",
            "So I want to write this issue and I believe the right thing to be done is to think out some some way of.",
            "Legalizing such search optimization.",
            "So giving the people a right way of saying OK for this specific application, we switch off reflexivity.",
            "We switch off this and that because we make this and that assumptions for performance purposes.",
            "Well, I agree that the way the URL fragment is defined, that very naive implementations could potentially have a problem with that.",
            "I mean, if you were trying to make build some sort of industrial strength implementation, you you know you could do something smarter that would get around that problem and you know.",
            "So we did you guys a real favor becausw, you know you can now sell your products that are, you know more smartly engineered and you know they're not all just going to take it bans.",
            "3 hour Python implementation instead.",
            "So you should be thanking us.",
            "But it is a serious answer.",
            "You can't expect naive implementations to work well.",
            "I mean even a regular, even a regular relational database.",
            "If you just do a very naive implementation, it won't work well in serious applications.",
            "Market leading artist source.",
            "Saying that.",
            "No, he said that if you implement it naively by just pouring triples into the triple store, then you would generate quite a lot of extra triples.",
            "Yeah you would.",
            "I'm saying you need to do something if you want to build systems that are really going to scale and be, you know, usable at industrial strength.",
            "You need to do some smarter engineering and you know the database companies have learned that long since they need to do it as well.",
            "We need to do it.",
            "Yes, if you just pour it into the Triple Store and try and run some forward chaining rules on it, though there will be problems.",
            "Well, I was saying Sophie slightly more complicated first.",
            "Within our implementation we have optimized this, so I definitely do not materialize all the reflexives same as statements because I mean I don't have to and within the documentation of the product we make clear statements why and how you can switch off and switch on this stuff so.",
            "The mature implementations already do this.",
            "My question was whether, whether on the language level it makes sense to have some standard standard notion of how this is being done.",
            "Currently I'm saying we ignore this and this you can use this option to ignore this axiomatic triples and these five rules because of this reason, and then you make your choice whether you want to do it or not.",
            "But this is not just just an issue with forward chaining because we have been always blamed that we do forward chaining.",
            "OK, you would have the same problem even with query evaluation.",
            "The question is when you are evaluating a query which is asking for oh, same as statements for certain UI, how long list you want to get and how long list is appropriate for different applications.",
            "For many applications, the information that X is same as X is useless.",
            "So it's not a matter of performance or forward chaining.",
            "You have other other arguments why well formed semantics like this could be inappropriate for some cases.",
            "One of the problems with all from my perspective is that all was designed very much and even correctly, but in out of the blue without real market experience with typically actually is a mistake and standardization because you should have implementations first before you are aiming to standardize it, But this did not happen with without, so I'm not too surprised that now these questions are coming in, however, needs to needs to happen at this point, obviously is a feedback loop into the translation process.",
            "Again, to exactly get this kind of experience being implementing the standard standardizing work as well.",
            "Income and so obviously I don't agree that you know the design of Al just came out of the blue.",
            "Actually, the profiles are based on careful studies of different kinds of application that people had.",
            "In particular, database data integration applications was one of the things that motivated the the QL profile, for example, and work that you know work in that area is been going on for a very long time, including, you know, very detailed study exactly what you need to do, data integration, and what you can do and still be able to keep your data in relational databases.",
            "So it's absolutely far from the case that that just, you know, drop down to a wormhole in space.",
            "So I'm trying to decide which thing I'm going to respond to.",
            "I'll just respond to that or just talk a little bit about language design because I think it's really difficult, and I spent a lot of time thinking about it and trying different effects, including statistical analysis.",
            "Though mine, mine and other peoples are a bit stale.",
            "We also it's the universe of Al is not that large.",
            "So compared to HTML it's just us.",
            "Just the fact that they have way more than we do to look at.",
            "But also, I mean, we've heard very vocal people here talk about wanting to have something smaller, but not always exactly saying what the benefits of the smaller that they want are.",
            "You know why they want it to be so small?",
            "I mean, this is a real issue actually, but on the other hand, we often get a lot of push from people who want more expressivity of various kinds out led the first outlet which led to L2 specific.",
            "Going to send back just a little bit 'cause you're looming?",
            "Well, you know you're a giant in my mind.",
            "And so you know.",
            "And then then there's a problem.",
            "I mean, and pretty much everybody says that what they need or what they don't need is mission critical, right?",
            "I mean, Alan Rector regularly writes me and says if we don't have this feature, the entire semantic web effort is stoned.",
            "And he's obviously wrong.",
            "And other people say, you know, if we add too much expressivity now that we're also doing, I think there's a wide range of uses, and I think that the model that we have now where we add.",
            "In a controlled way, features that have been that we have at least some users that are strongly committed to using and showcase applications in particular are added to the overall language and then we have profiles which are generally useful and applicable to pretty wide domains and are easy to really, truly easy to implement.",
            "So you'd have to be.",
            "You have to be smart about them.",
            "This is this is a pretty good way of doing it, and maybe it's the best we can do.",
            "I mean, if we if we wait any one evidence to strongly, we're going to.",
            "We're going to be.",
            "We just won't do anything and so we have to take some risks and some and some guesses here just because of the and in any standard mean.",
            "So it's good to give feedback and it's really, really valuable.",
            "But it's also really important that when you're thinking about it, charged.",
            "In thinking about what you're going to push or what you're going to resist to, try to take a broader view and consider and consider how why other people might feel differently.",
            "And now Jim so.",
            "I just thought, well, I actually to some degree agree with you Big Sean.",
            "You started that with no one has, despite the fact that I'm on record both public and in the working group and in number of other places representing the language fragment that the five companies I'm on, the advisory boards of and the company you know, the organizations I represent are.",
            "So I think that was a little disingenuous.",
            "I mean, there were several proposals made that said.",
            "Right again, the issue becomes where this conversation can occur.",
            "If it can't occur within the working group.",
            "So do we have to get RDF to accept some owl?",
            "Do we have to move in different ways and part of the reason for this is simply because different groups with different opinions come to different places, but this is certainly a thing you're under.",
            "So thank you, be John and Jim.",
            "Sorry I hate when people call me disingenuous.",
            "All I meant is that it's not clear why LRL doesn't cover what you what you wanted.",
            "We did it specifically for that, and so you know we can argue about the details, but I still haven't understood why are all such a bad thing for you.",
