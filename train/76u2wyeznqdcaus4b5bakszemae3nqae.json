            "So if I remember correctly, they saved roughly 50% of the time from the first time they started the product until the airplane could be produced because of the tight integration with the suppliers and the additional knowledge each of those suppliers could bring in.",
            "And it was a win win situation for both because the suppliers could apply their best practices and still make sure they're going to be the supplier of chair of choice when it actually comes to building the whole airplane."

            "And we're using the supply chain only on a project basis, and a project usually means like development of a single product.",
            "So the key identifiers for that kind of thing is it's user usually started by an idea like I want to build a certain product.",
            "It tries to be a best of Reed approach, so once I said like I want to build this kind of product, I'm searching for the best suppliers I can get to help me build my product.",

            "You have limited exposure both ways.",

            "A lot of things are going wrong.",
            "For the organization.",

            "But you know, neither can your competitors.",
            "Working together with them to try and fulfill the order is a win win situation for both of you, because if you don't collaborate, neither of you will get the order.",
            "And because those project based supply chains are only limited to a project like an order of a of an OEM that works.",
            "Um?",
            "And it allows you to have extended capabilities because.",
            "You get, as I said, the best of Reed approach, which also means the key competancies of the suppliers get together and give you a larger capabilities than what you have in your own organization.",
            "Obviously there are drawbacks.",
            "Flexibility is not something which is great in the legal system.",
            "Because, um.",
            "Contracts are built to last usually and not to be thrown away very quickly.",
            "It's also a mentality issue.",
            "Depending on where you come from, having a strong relationship between you and your supplier is key of business.",
            "That is a cultural thing, which is different.",
            "Across Europe.",
            "Usually what I've personally experienced so far, the higher North Hugo.",
            "The higher the flexibility is.",
            "But that might just be my personal.",
            "Experience so far.",
            "The second drawback is the high need for software.",
            "And the high need for integration of software and of standards and software.",
            "We're just experiencing in the E 4 project how dire that.",
            "Need actually can be and how it can easily kill off the idea of a collaboration because it takes time to integrate systems.",
            "Hopefully in the future it shouldn't, but that's still an issue and last but not least, the whole discussion of intellectual property.",
            "Again, this goes on the one hand to the legal side.",
            "On the other hand, also to a business side, like if you're jointly developing a product.",
            "With your suppliers who has the intellectual property on what?",
            "Because it's not built to last.",
            "What are we going to do with the bits and pieces we have from the project?",
            "That is also always an issue.",
            "And the last bit.",
            "Is the process orientation so in the process orientation we sat down and said like, OK, we want to have a project based.",
            "We want to focus on supply chain management and we want to have strict process is within the system so we're kind of like guiding SMS along the way so they're not so the idea is not like every SMEs is free an using like their own obscure, sometimes obscure process is.",
            "But we are trying to provide like a best practice process is which they can then adapt their actual activities too.",
            "So we have a preparation phase which for instance begins with the whole setup.",
            "If you're looking into a platform which does all those supply chain management.",
            "Remember I talked about information information we need to get that information into those systems, so we need to make sure we have all our components in there.",
            "And actually all the components of potential suppliers as well.",
            "We need to relate.",
            "Process is to components.",
            "We need to make sure that when we are producing something in which order do we need the components?",
            "How are they build up to?",
            "Once we have a certain process defined.",
            "We need to add activities to that process because the process is a set of activities which are actually done within an organization to achieve something.",
            "In this case a component.",
            "Anne.",
            "And and this part is crucial.",
            "Associate microprocessors to activities.",
            "What do we mean by that?",
            "Microprocessors is our standardized process is which.",
            "Which have been defined like in other research projects.",
            "Lots of people have been thinking about them.",
            "And but usually they do not translate 1 to one to an activity, and organization is doing.",
            "So therefore we need to map the things we're doing in our organization to those micro processes.",
            "So our activities, like the SMS activities in building a component suddenly become comperable to someone else.",
            "Does this make sense?",
            "So um and last but not least.",
            "Because we're running out of time, I'm trying to skip a little bit here.",
            "We need to select key performance indicators.",
            "Second phase is basically a setup phase, so we are that is the phase.",
            "Once we have all the information in the system we can actually start by saying, OK, let's start a new project like Build a certain product.",
            "We associate the product with it.",
            "We define the Bill of materials like what are the components my product is build off.",
            "And we define how the product is structured from that set up phase.",
            "We can directly go into the project phase.",
            "Which then gives us the ability for automated task generation based on the process is because we did all the definition in the preparation phase and we said like this is the structure of my component of my product.",
            "I'm going to build.",
            "The system has all the information to go and see like OK. What are the activities needed to build my product depending on which supplier I'm choosing?",

            "So when I'm choosing a supplier to build or provide a certain component.",

            "Basically all of that.",
            "So the idea of saying we're going to provide a single platform that will help as enemies in Central and Eastern European countries as a whole to move on that path, which I originally showed is a little bit got a little bit more difficult because we need to start from different starting points.",
            "Yeah, and as I mentioned, there are very few clusters.",
            "I mean there are like what we learn.",
            "For instance, in Bulgaria clusters are like not really known Slovenia.",
            "On the other hand has a couple of them, so it's again like in an issue of difference.",

            "Um?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Well.",
            "There is low usage and knowledge of ICT.",

            "Everything else is done on paper.",

            "They're very cost sensitive.",
            "So it also means it takes a lot of convincing to say like you're going to gain a lot by using such a platform.",
            "It's much more difficult because you really need to do every turn on investment analysis.",
            "An that analysis is for a very short time period.",

            "What we also learned is they prefer cheap human labor over automated ICT solutions.",
            "So if a process can be automated by ICT but over the period of two years it's cheaper to hire someone to actually do it manually.",
