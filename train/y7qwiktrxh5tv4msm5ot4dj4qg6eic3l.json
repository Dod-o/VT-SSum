            "So what do I mean by image labeling problems?",
            "Something like semantic segmentation or object segmentation where you have an image.",
            "Write something like this right and it is composed of some pixels and you want to assign a label to each pixel, right?",
            "And that's why image labeling.",
            "So you want to label every pixel in the image right?",
            "In this problem we want to label.",
            "A pixel and the label set could be the different object categories that could be found in an image.",
            "For example the Sky, the building, the grass, the tree, the car, so on, right?",
            "There are so many possible possibilities and we want to assign for every pixel here.",
            "What sort of object category sort of it belongs to.",
            "So we have labeled it Sky, right?",
            "So essentially this is an image labeling problem.",
            "Semantic segmentation is an image labeling problem.",
            "Another labeling problem.",
            "Now this is not an image labeling problem, but it is sort of.",
            "We're not now labeling pixels, but we're trying to estimate.",
            "The assignments that should be given to some pose variables the orientation variables like the pose of a person is sort of defined by what are the different joint angles and we want to find out given the particular image what are the different joint angles in that in that image.",
            "So it's also a labeling problem where the variables are now different.",
            "Another sort of image labeling or pixel labeling problem is geometry estimation, right where you have an image and you want to assign the label whether each pixel sort of belongs to a vertical plane or a horizontal plane of it, or if it is a vertical plane, whether it's sort of a left facing vertical plane or a left right facing vertical plane.",
