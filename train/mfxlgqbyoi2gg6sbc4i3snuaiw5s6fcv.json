            "If we had talked about transparency and the carbon footprint, the first thing for us was to find ways how to measure your carbon footprint, where a medium sized logistics operator, we have open network.",
            "We are really.",
            "We depend on partners to deliver our transports because we are not present in all the countries.",
            "That means you have interfaces to partner companies to railway operators to airlines.",
            "If you are in the airfreight business to overseas handlers and what we have seen and what was or is still the major.",
            "A problem for us is how to get the information necessary to estimate our carbon footprint.",
            "We know very well within our own network of what tracks we use and what handling efforts we have so we can measure the carbon footprint within our own network.",
            "But as soon as a consignment leaves our network and goes into the partner network, we don't know any longer what route the consignment takes.",
            "So what?",
            "What modes are used for the transport and on the other hand, we also see that there still is a problem from the regulation side that it's still not clear on on a national and on the European basis how you should estimate your carbon footprint.",
            "We still wait on any regulations that tell us how we can estimate the carbon footprint, and as long as that's not clear I guess we're fooling ourselves.",
            "If we say we can estimate our carbon footprint, or if we can calculate it the best we can do is make an estimated guess an educated guess on what our carbon footprint is, and that's it for the time being, and I think if you think about optimizing your carbon footprint, you first have to make sure that there is transparency and we're still fighting with the transparency, and I think we're still a long way.",
            "Away from starting to improve our carbon footprint.",
            "Should I jump in so I apologize for being late?",
            "Actually this is an area where in the United States there has been a fair amount of work recently, partially driven by Walmart requirements to their top suppliers to provide the carbon footprint information for not only the manufacturing but the transportation impact on the carbon footprint of their of their primary products.",
            "And so there's a.",
            "There's actually a fair amount of current research and information that is being done and available.",
            "And I don't.",
            "I don't have the source is off the top of my head, but our Center for transportation logistics in MIT has been active in this, but also many other research groups in the States and again driven by some very large.",
            "And retailers that are consciously wanting to be green, you know that they have had green programs.",
            "One question that I would like to learn that way.",
            "Going from from my point of view, I mean there are some pro.",
            "I mean there are always some activities each intracompany, let's say for little eyes are trying to kind of improve the process.",
            "I mean anyway, that interpretation usually means I save some money and I do something for the environment.",
            "At the same time, I think it's also very much related to the pressure that's coming from the outside, so customers who are actually saying, yeah, I would like to.",
            "Let's say I would like to do something in this direction.",
            "Would like to have my product is somehow we made it to sustainable production, for example.",
            "So this needs to then in the end also be transported in the sustainable way so.",
            "I need the nearest Apple Store 1st and easy.",
            "But what I want to say is that the.",
            "Anne.",
            "The monitoring of the flows of energy in companies is, to my understanding, something which is akin to the monitoring of the flow of money.",
            "Showing the we have the law of preservation of energy.",
            "So what goes in goes out.",
            "There's even better than with money that goes in sometimes increases and sometimes decreases or you have to compute again at a loss.",
            "About legally and in other ways, we're very much obliged.",
            "Tetration exactly where our money remains and we are in in modern systems also reasonably good.",
            "Interesting where our goods remained, that's logistics, but we are very poor, interesting in general in companies where our energy remains, and that in itself is strange.",
            "Situation which in my view could be.",
            "That could be improved by Frances, the ERP vendors and which legally could be enforced in the same way as V-80 for example.",
            "That's also a good thing that we deliver now that this that holds much energy in general.",
            "Of course, we are also interested in renewable energy or sustainable energy.",
            "Green energy if you want.",
            "That's the kind of of of.",
            "Extra difficulty that it also in my view should be traceable and should be.",
            "I'm not sure whether you want to enforce it legally, but if those combination of like brutalize get the pressure from from companies like Procter and Gamble to to to explain what their carbon footprint is.",
            "In my view they need this type of systems, otherwise it cause all the time and ad hoc effort and that is inefficient, ineffective, an difficult to sustain.",
            "The certification pills.",
            "I mean we have this dies on 9000 and we have people are kind of war kind of sophisticated involved there like there's 14,000 more coming up which also hasn't the newest iteration of it.",
            "And let's say if you need to show over the over behind that you are improving.",
            "And then having this kind of certification that this off on your business opportunities.",
            "Maybe again on real, yes.",
            "Maybe I should elaborate.",
            "I should deliberate on that.",
            "Yes it can.",
            "We at the blue device for a few years now practice and internal competition between our branch offices.",
            "Where we are.",
            "Check all their economic kepis how they perform, what their profit is.",
            "But we also estimate their environmental impact.",
            "How much paper they waste, how much energy they use for operating all their facilities and.",
            "We make that the competition was in the company and through that we enforce that the branch office managers try to improve the energy efficiency, their environmental impact and stuff like that.",
            "And on the other hand I think you don't really need the pressure from the outside to go green.",
            "There can also be a business case for going green.",
            "I think that was what you related to at the beginning of with moving from the road.",
            "To the railroad.",
            "For us, we had a huge amount of trucks driving from Fahlberg to Vienna every day, about 30 to 40 trucks a day.",
            "And if you have such a critical mass then you can really move all those trucks to the train.",
            "At you save money and you have a business case for yourself, But the problem often in this case is that you need to critical mass that you can fill a whole train so that you can move all your trucks away from the road to the train.",
            "Stealing from the US army, Mr. Xyzal 14,000 something that companies are eager to kind of applied or.",
            "So Jessica, a couple of things 11 to recognize around the world.",
            "This is a very current in real topic of concern.",
            "And so in the United States will often look at market driven solutions.",
            "We just had an election in the United States, so it looks like whatever new initiatives that we might have proposed, or probably not not going to go very far in the next couple of years, so we wouldn't expect this given the outcome of the current election cycle to happen during during this current presidents.",
            "Tenure, but from a from a market driven perspective.",
            "Clearly some kind of trading network where you can trade carbon credits is something that some people think has a great business opportunity and value proposition associated with it independent of that.",
            "You you spoke to two issues.",
            "One was.",
            "I mean we have energy contained in our product slate.",
            "Sort of.",
            "You know, entropy sunk into the products themselves and actually Europe.",
            "You have much better regulations on requirements for electronics manufacturers, for example to track and to calculate into the cost of the sale price.",
            "And they have some mechanism to dispose of electronics.",
            "You're far ahead of the United States in in that particular required.",
            "On the other hand we see.",
            "For example, Best Buy.",
            "Staples, some of the large electronics retailers all have very aggressive green, you know, bring in your use cell phone and will recycle for that for you on that trash track.",
            "Example that I showed you this morning where we tracked the trash from Seattle.",
            "It was quite interesting to see that the existing recycling programs through some of these major retailers and that some of the cities have in place are actually working.",
            "If you, if you remember some of the cell phones went to Chicago where the debate with the.",
            "Logistics guys, was that because the trains went there and that the trash was all in that range?",
            "Have turned down notes?",
            "'cause that's where they recycle.",
            "Cell phones in the largest cell phone recycler is there, but so there are fewer retailer.",
            "I mean just getting people into your store.",
            "I mean if it if they have to come with their their their piece of use, electronic equipment turns out to have some significant value and so people are using it in very creative in new and different ways.",
            "Anyway, there's a startup that's a social networking company that I saw on the way here on the plane.",
            "They have something like 10,000,000 subscribers in two months to start up on the West coast of just people who are concerned about green issues and they shared green things with each other, so it's very clearly in the popular psyche, something that people are concerned about and want to see their suppliers and their backers do something about.",
            "At least in our part of the world.",
            "These just like the benchmarks there indicators.",
            "So.",
            "Concepts like mean score for example.",
            "I mean this core model.",
            "I think everybody knows that.",
            "So there is also clean school model.",
            "I mean you guys are from there.",
            "This is one of the field, so question is has anybody heard about the application of it?",
            "I mean we've all heard about this core model but we never heard about the Green school right now that we have a group of logistics professionals, how many people use the score model in their logistics practice today?",
            "That's it, that's the problem.",
            "We have some models now and I think this is something that only as well say.",
            "I mean how to compare what kind of what kind of measurements we actually have.",
            "And there are measurements.",
            "But somehow they don't have the acceptance.",
            "That would most probably like to have."

        [
            "So the business opportunities we've already talked shortly about this one.",
            "Any indication on how big this market is?",
            "I mean what we're seeing are kind of spotlights.",
            "I think we're talking about Walmart, Best Buy Staples dies in the US.",
            "Question is, do we see an increasing market and then two?",
            "Is there somewhere boundary for that?",
            "I mean size wise, maybe years.",
            "You could start from the SUV.",
            "Well, so I I think the first thing I would say, and actually at the Sloan School at MIT, they've had a series of green initiatives and studies and surveys of businesses and so on.",
            "And I think the first observation is that we would be terribly mistaken if we if we divorced green products from our regular product strategy at some point.",
            "If your product isn't a certain level of greenness.",
            "And of course there's been a great deal of controversy.",
            "Over the fact there are a lot of products labeled as green that aren't right, but at some point if you don't do that, somebody is not going to.",
            "I mean, there's certainly a significant section of the population is not going to buy your product, so it's not like you have an awful lot of choice, right?",
            "We we we need to also an you know, the world will come to an end if we don't find a way of dealing with this.",
            "So, so there's there's, you know.",
            "I'm not sure if we think of it as a standalone market, is is.",
            "Is quite right now actually.",
            "An analogy that that we can see already happening in, uh, so this isn't this isn't green, as in green energy, but this is in green as an organic foods, so I I'm disappointed.",
            "Don't be citing Walmart so often, but it's it's been a very successful and creative and innovative company and they've they've innovative once again and they're going into in the retail food merchandising and they're going with organic foods.",
            "So they've locked up production for organic growers throughout the Western United States and into South America with certified Green Real organic products that they are moving.",
            "And so, so if you're a natural food grocer, you're going to have a big competitor in your backyard and all their products are going to be green.",
            "And so again, whether it is, I'm not sure that the separate it out.",
            "I mean, it's it's an integral part of a strategy that.",
            "Major players are adapting and that consumers are concerned about.",
            "Everybody I would think would need to have it as part of their business plan.",
            "No, that's to confirm what we just said yesterday.",
            "We had the.",
            "A workshop on this topic and logistics for life, and there was a position, let's say more aggressive from one operator setting that actually.",
            "True greatness could be a model by itself, like a separate business unit or an offer that is well defined for those customers that are willing to give up someone other performances to get greener.",
            "While there was a more conservative operator saying look, we're getting green anyway.",
            "So this is done through.",
            "This is done through continuous improvement of our process is so we did generate of course less emissions.",
            "We consume less fuel and also are less costly, so it doesn't make any sense to advertise a green supply chain services, since that's already, let's say happening.",
            "So it's business as usual.",
            "I see these are like 2 extreme positions, probably in the future.",
            "Being able to to offer a route, I mean a transport plan include calculating even on.",
            "Environmental parameters that could be a + 4.",
            "Say I hand off the market to logistic operators while on the other hand, a dedicated business.",
            "We have seen some cases.",
            "There are many cases that, let's say in Europe.",
            "Dedicated business created just for.",
            "They say green transport is now struggling a lot, specially with the crisis that have been not increased despite the relevance to to the public opinion this has they anyway are struggling to survive.",
            "So that's.",
            "As always said, trade off situation to be managed.",
            "No.",
            "Supermarkets and food suppliers have created dedicated supply change, also physically in terms of physical warehouses, physical transportation rules, new companies, etc.",
            "To separate the change completely, I think that is.",
            "Uh, not an optimal solution because it creates actually a larger carbon footprint cause you have a restful attraction.",
            "Cetera and clever use of it, especially offer tracking and tracing functionality should solve that issue, and so that if you can track and trace incredible way.",
            "Green and less clean products through one another.",
            "I'd be better.",
            "Maybe just a quick.",
            "Addition to that, I think sometimes or my impression is that sometimes when we talk about green products that we fool ourselves or what green means in the logistics sector, if you say we have a green product, we transport your goods from A to B.",
            "What do you expect from the word green that the driver stops from time to time and plant 3 besides the roads or something like that?",
            "A good example for that I heard a few weeks ago about apples.",
            "If you go to a grocery store and buy some apples, it depends on the time of the year.",
            "If the apples from Austria are the green product or the apples from New Zealand are the green product.",
            "Because if you look at the carbon footprint of the Apple, if it.",
            "If it grows in Austria and it's brought in in autumn and then you store it in a cool warehouse until July of the next year, then the carbon footprint of that Apple is worse than the Apple that you get from New Zealand by ship or by airplane.",
            "So you better buy the Apple from NZ if you want a green product.",
            "So I think sometimes we're fooling ourselves about what green really means.",
            "May I add one month Mark 2?",
            "No.",
            "What is said here?",
            "I think the focus is here on the on the external business case, so to say to enlarge the market.",
            "There is also often an internal business case, and I think that the example that was just given by you on the green.",
            "Champion within the tribe Rhythm is a very good one.",
            "You hear often that companies actually continue with the lean and efforts and continuous improvement efforts by focusing on.",
            "On waste of materials or waste of energy, so reduction of waste in energy is not only a kind of.",
            "External driver for a but it is also simply across life and in many cases you can see that reduction of packaging, waste, reduction of energy waste is.",
            "It is very well a, uh, aligned with cost reduction programs in business.",
            "Maybe you can share these this green one so that we can keep one there in the audience because I would like we should have asked the cleaning of the audience there something questions.",
            "I have a question then the the big energy consumers at the moment like the utility companies aluminium production companies they already have a CEO to quote them and I'm not sure about the timeline, but my understanding is that.",
            "Also, the logistics industry will be faced with carbon quota, meaning an airline will be assigned a certain quota and that's it.",
            "You cannot produce more CO2, so that will limit your movements.",
            "As for trucks, for example.",
            "So let's say that happens within the next 5 to 10 years.",
            "How does that affect your logistics strategy?",
            "Because that means that the more green you are I the less you see it till you produce the more.",
            "Transport movements you can make, and the better you can compete with others and some others have to make choices.",
            "I mean as an airline, are you going to fly people on holiday?",
            "I get you're going to Fly Pharmaceuticals to another country or are you going to import white beans out of Africa to stimulate the local economy?",
            "You know this is a whole different set of of of decision-making.",
            "What is your view on them?",
            "Obviously.",
            "What?",
            "Is this working?",
            "Is that alright?",
            "So other than so, I think this is what Mr. Jean package this morning from the Commission.",
            "Apparently this is the gauntlet.",
            "This is the challenge that they're laying down for your industry, which is that by 2020 European Commission is going to be looking to the transport industry for about 20% greenhouse meeting.",
            "20% of the Green House production quota for the for what?",
            "the European Commission?",
            "Has agreed to do so.",
            "As you suggest, this is a very real issue and it may be one that's an opportunity for for the groups that are represented here to work together on in response to the to the new initiative by the Commission.",
            "But that's I mean, that's clearly a big one.",
            "But then we have this share system in place right where you can kind of buy you out of this year.",
            "Two problem.",
            "But we just had a little broken.",
            "Thanks a lot.",
            "If I just make command on what Steven said is we're serious about that.",
            "And as America expressed that very clear.",
            "And we're serious on one inside.",
            "There might be that system of emission certificates on one inside, but on the other hand side we also prepared to accompany this change.",
            "For example, in our research programs, and I mentioned that earlier this morning, but with some money available for that.",
            "On the research side, this is one part.",
            "The other part is of course on the organizational side, and so there will be some means to support, but in the end there's action required from the sector.",
            "That's very clear.",
            "So what about this share system this year?",
            "To share system, I mean when you finished in principle buy shares from other countries, isn't that kind of bypassing the whole system to some extent and actually kind of, let's say, healing effects that you were just describing?",
            "I don't know if your target is to reduce greenhouse gases by a certain amount.",
            "You don't care who does it, just as long as collectively people do it.",
            "And so we've talked about ITICT and logistics for optimizing transportation routing to make it more efficient.",
            "If you have a target for greenhouse gas emissions, if follow and I can workout a deal and he wants to do extra work and I can pay a little extra, maybe it's maybe it's good, but the overall target is with student.",
            "Let me say that your view of.",
            "European Community Life is very I mean positive very.",
            "It shows that you look at that at us from the other side of the ocean because.",
            "In this circumstance, cool stance is usually there is some country which is let's say they.",
            "The good guys who are actually saving the planet even for the other, but they are all on the same, say ship known the same European Union environment.",
            "So that's going to generate some political.",
            "Let's say Sir balances.",
            "We have seen it in other circumstances, so it makes sense, I think.",
            "Yeah, just some some comments on on on the points like the carbon footprint and indicators and things like that.",
