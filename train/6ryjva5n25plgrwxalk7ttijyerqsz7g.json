            "You could make some sort of ionization chamber between the sample and the between the nozzle and the sample, but yes, you've got to have some sort of a method of detecting the beam because you've got to have some very fast electronics which basically opens the switch, waits for particle to come, and then immediately closes the switch, and that's got to happen in a few 10s of nanoseconds.",
