            "They go to the Internet to search, to read up news, to search for information, to read Wikipedia, and so on and so forth.",

            "Producers can get paid.",
            "So for example, one way would be if we just go out and buy their products.",

            "All the descriptions of their products they maintain the review pages they come up with, good recommendations for products and all of that.",
            "All of this is paid for because we pay we buy products from them.",
            "Another model is the so called paid subscription model where an example of this would be the Wall Street Journal.",
            "So if you want to read good articles from Wall Street Journal, you have to pay a subscription price to Wall Street Journal.",
            "And the reason this works is because there are enough people out there who are willing to pay to get this high quality content from Wall Street Journal.",

            "And as more and more people are moving onto the Internet and spending more time on the Internet, advertisers advertisers are shifting their dollars and following the people online.",
            "So to give an example, in circa 2006 or so there was an estimate that around 10 billion dollars were spent in advertising online, and this was an increase of 17% over the previous years expenditure.",
            "So it's clearly a very big jump or a big growth industry at the present, and there is a long way to go.",
            "So there was some estimate that around 150 billion dollars are being spent on advertising all over.",
            "And this is so it's essentially one big order of magnitude jump.",

            "But on the Web people control their interactions.",
            "They can say what URL I'm going to look at, what content I'm going to look at, how I'm going to interact with the world.",
            "So if I showed some content and some ads, people can simply choose to ignore their head and focus on the content and I'm sure.",
            "Many of us have somehow trained ourselves to just ignore the ads.",
            "Nowadays, for instance, almost instinctively, when I look at the search results page, I just look at the search result contents and ignore all the ads that show up.",
            "So in this sort of scenario, even though the ads are being shown to the users, they're not making an impression on the users.",
            "The users are not really seeing the ads, and so in this sort of setting, well, what sort of thing would justify putting ads up online?",
            "When would users actually?",
            "See my ads and look at my ad and understand my product.",
            "Get attracted to pay product and so.",
            "How would online advertising work when users do not interact?",
            "Have have the control in the interaction process and the answer to this is really twofold.",
            "The first part of the answer is the massive scale at which online advertising has to work.",
            "So essentially you have to send out ads or serve ads to millions of users thousands of times, perhaps having billions of such transactions between users and ads over the over the course of an entire month.",
            "So essentially you are showing the ads many, many times to many many different users in the hope that sometime somewhere some users are going to see the ad get affected by the ad, get attracted by the product and so on.",
            "So it has to work on really massive scales and in addition it has to have very low marginal cost.",
            "So the cost of serving anyone given add to 1 user in one particular setting in terms of 1 particular content has to be very low typically.",
            "There has to be very low latency of the order of, let's say, 10s of milliseconds to show an ad, plus you should not be requiring too much computational effort, cause if you spend too much effort to come up with the best possible ad to show for this content and that the user simply chooses to ignore that, then you've wasted all this effort.",
            "So you have to come up with very low marginal cost ways of showing ads, and many many different ads to many many different users so massive scale and low marginal costs together define this online advertising business.",
            "But then this automatically means that you cannot really have a human in the loop.",
            "It's just too costly and too slow to have humans do any sort of editorial processing or even online picking of ads and so forth.",
            "So all of this has to be done automatically on the fly using very little computational effort.",
            "And the key here is to monetize even a little bit better, even a little bit more so if we can come up with something that just barely improves what the current system is doing.",
            "This can translate into millions of dollars.",
            "Once you consider the massive scales at which this process is run.",
            "And now there are many different ways we can think of to try to monetize better.",
            "But as data miners, one obvious way that we have is to learn from data.",
            "So typically any any running computational, advertising or online advertising system will generate huge historical logs, so logs of the form that I showed this particular add to this particular user who comes from this particular demographic when the user was actually looking at this particular content on this particular web page, and so on.",
            "And then I showed this ad, the user either clicked on the ad or did not click on the ad and I have billions of such transactions.",
            "This sort of this historical data is very noisy.",
            "The signal is is very weak, but if we can extract some little bit of information out of this then this can lead us to monetize better come up with a better model of what is a good add to show for this particular content and this would lead us to immense gains even lucratively in terms of millions of dollars or.",
            "Just more satisfied users and this is part of the reason why online advertising is becoming this important field.",

            "It's not really a completely new field, it's really more of an amalgam of fields and problems that we've already seen so far.",
            "But just with special added constraints.",
            "So for instance, if I want to show ads to users, well, initially I'll have to look at the ad and figure out what the site is all about, so I have to do some sort of textual processing of the ad.",
            "Maybe natural language processing of the ad to figure out what it's about.",
            "So text analysis becomes important.",
            "I'll have to store this, add in some sort of a database.",
            "So that I can quickly retrieve the ad when it becomes the best ad for this for some given content in some setting.",

            "What adds match work pages or what my ads match?",
            "The user queries and so on.",
            "So this requires looking at all sorts of historical data and coming up with a good model.",
            "This is exactly what we do in statistical modeling and machine learning models, and so on.",
            "Again, optimization problems become important.",
            "For instance, one example would be that.",
            "Instead of showing just one ad, I want to show 2 ads on the top of the content to ads on the side of the content.",
            "So four ads total.",
            "So I have to optimize for this entire set of four ads.",
            "But these ads sort of are correlated with each other.",
            "I want to show as diverse as as possible, but also adds that are individually pretty good and so on.",
            "So how do I optimize for this entire set of ads as against just picking their top four hands again?",
            "There's this whole separate area of faking it, figuring out how much money should be paid for ads.",
            "What is the market price of a given at an so auction theory, mechanism design and all of these problems come up.",
            "Microeconomics shows up in this problem, so essentially computational advertising is this holistic approach to all of these different problems.",
            "But then haven't all these problems been solved in literature?",
            "Here the answer is that computational advertising is all of these problems, but under a special constraint, the constraints which we just looked at.",
            "It has to operate on massive scales, and there has to be low marginal cost.",
            "So your answer should be very fast, very quick, and it should operate with huge amounts of data, and this is where most of the algorithms that we already have in the literature for these things don't typically scale so much, and this is where we have to come up with better algorithms.",

            "Do not really go to the advertisers websites directly.",
            "And so there is a mismatch between these two.",
            "And this is where the ad network comes in.",
            "So the ad network aggregates all sorts of different ads in different ad campaigns from many different advertisers to achieve the economies of scale and the massive scale that's necessary to make online advertising work.",
            "And then at runtime, when the user comes to an content provider, the content provider performs one call back to the ad network, ask the ad network to provide some ad and the ad network can pick and choose some ad to show along with the content just shown back to the user.",
            "And if this ad.",
            "That was shown to the user is somehow successful and the definitions of success differ based on the current on what setting is being used.",
            "But if the ad shown was successful, then the advertiser pays the ad network and the ad network pays a fraction of that money with the content provide.",
            "So essentially the user is happy because the user gets the content, the advertiser is happy because the ad gets shown in the middle.",
            "Men in the content provider and ad network are both happy because they get money out of this entire process.",

            "So given the price today, I know this is the set of demands that are going to come to my system next month.",
            "So now the question is if a salesperson submits a request for a new inventory.",
            "Should you actually accept it or not?",
            "That's the mathematical question.",
            "So now the key mathematical challenge here is called overlapping inventory.",

            "If there is a feasible solution, you'll say we accept this.",

            "OK, so yeah, this is the first problem.",
            "OK, now, let's now let's look at the second question.",

            "Supply pull should go to contract 120% should go to contractor, right?",
            "That's a feasible allocation and that's the allocation which we're really comfortable with.",

            "Alright, so first objective function which is very natural is can you do some cherry picking right?",
            "So only give the advertisers what they want.",

            "I mean the market is going to adjust to these things.",
            "So at the end of the day, you know you're buying ads in bulk, you're not buying ad, you're saying poor impression.",
