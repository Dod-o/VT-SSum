            "One on the side of master and the other one is slave.",

            "And then for sure we have one final one that's called excitation flow.",
            "To get the current condition.",
            "So these surveys are basically not needed, but they were helpful if they were created from CAD.",
            "Package makes it easier here.",
            "So if you want to proceed, I'd like to adjust the analysis first of all, to make sure that we can now run a kind of a transient or called dynamic analysis.",
            "While the default is magnetostatic, you see that here we have to switch the analysis type to become transient.",
            "OK, so to do so, simply use the right mouse button here and change the analysis type that's called solution type here.",
            "By the way you know, see here.",
            "The solution times or pass or within the solver static is something obvious that is an Eddy current.",
            "I call it AC analysis and the one that we are going to care here is we want to have motion as a function of time there interested in current versus time, so it's obviously transit OK. And then there is one more thing that we can actually do here is we can also go into design settings.",
            "We're going to just one more parameter here.",
            "That's going to be specified orfano symmetry modifier.",
            "We know that this is not the whole machine from an engineering point of view.",
            "We're interested on the charging current from the total machine.",
            "While the circuit design is going to be made for the whole machine.",
            "To make the analysis as cheap as possible in terms of numerical efforts, we modeled the smallest sector possible.",
            "Something that helps us to get fast analysis.",
            "But then we need to tell the program OK. Once the symmetry modifier.",
            "In that case, it's office space.",
            "OK, so by typing in this, all of the quantities that are going to be integrated or the full ones.",

            "I've done that.",
            "Now the full machine parameters, that's the way that engineering expects it, because nobody is interested in an age of the losses on Ace of the torque or whatever.",
            "But you know, for a numerical description it is.",
            "It is very, very helpful to model smallest.",
            "By the way, if you carefully look into that claw machine, we will figure out that there is one more symmetry possible.",
            "But that's a trivia symmetry.",
            "You can even model off of the structure here, so when 116, but it does, it's not allowed right now inside of Maxwell because it has some.",
            "Strange symmetry with the cycle of 1 eight degree connecting one side with the other, which is not possible right?",
            "This is easy implemented, so at least we know we have resources to even improve the speed by a factor of two.",
            "If the program was doing what we want to do.",
            "OK, so that's it.",

            "I want to remind from time to time please save.",
            "Because otherwise, the work that you've done is not going to be stored, so it's not a waste of time.",
            "OK. Um?",
            "When working with a little bit more of a complicated geometry compared to the sensor, at least we have a number of more parts.",
            "Would I always recommend before specifying a lots of boundary condition stuff?",
            "Tried whether the geometry is measurable or not.",
            "It happens from time to time that there is geometry that has some holes.",
            "The geometry is not fully describe.",
            "Then the measure fails and then you have to redo your work, which is loaded cumbersome.",
            "So maybe it's a good idea.",
            "We do not have to do this here, but just want to mention it.",
            "To simply insert an analysis set up here and simply stop meshing.",
            "If the meshing fails due to geometry problem, we can solve this without losing time.",
            "So that's more practical way of using it, as this geometry is tested.",
            "It's my pass to guarantee that this works, so it should actually work, and we're going to proceed.",
            "OK, what is that description that we need to do something falling from top to bottom?",
            "We have prescribed the model here.",
            "The next step would be boundary condition offers on the boundary conditions.",
            "You mentioned this before.",
            "It would be obviously master slave conditions.",
            "And as the model is nicely prepared with these master side and the slave side, which are the cutting edge of our structure, we can now specify these Masters layfon condition.",
            "So the way we're going to do that.",
            "Is we are selecting the master surface?",
            "You can do this year in a tree or graphically, but selecting a tree is easier, so selecting these master and then as before right mouse button then we have all the functions and the function that we were going to use here is specifying assigning boundary master.",
            "So why is it called master and why do other one called slave?",
            "Well, we actually know that due to the symmetry factor the field.",
            "Fulfills is certainly relation from for every point on one side to kind of acidity point on the other side.",
            "And there's two options possible, the other one.",
            "The one is that the field exactly matches magnitude and direction on both sides or we get in 180 degree phase shift.",
            "So in that case it matches so we only have to specify what are the master in slave surface is and what's the symmetry character.",
            "So the first is the master here.",
            "You can give them a name, but the name is not important.",
            "More important is the orientation of the symmetry.",
            "I prefer creating my own vector while then leaving the program and what I need to do is here I need to use the mouse pointer to fix on one of these points that are part of the surface is just going to that.",
            "Or if you want to go just just go in there.",
            "And then use another one that's at the other end.",
            "Have you done this?",
            "You get in define later that stands the surface.",
            "Why's it important?",
            "Because two surface or not sufficient.",
            "The program should somehow determine what is the direction in positive or negative.",
            "Terms regarding to the to the surface, so that's now one side and we should have a similar one to the other side.",
            "It must not be the same as I have, but for both master and slave it should look similar, so the blue error looks in axial direction.",
            "The Red 1 looks in playing to my surface.",
            "That's my specification.",
            "You might want to have different ones with.",
            "This is not important, so I haven't done this year, and that's OK. And if you have done this with one side, please proceed with similar procedure to the other side.",
            "So select slave right mouse button bandri slave.",
            "And there's only one difference.",
            "If you specify the slave the program wants to know what is the master that is going to be associated with that slave.",
            "So the relation is already known.",
            "OK, so we select the master that we defined before.",
            "And then we specify a new vector.",
            "Same procedure as before.",
            "Selecting one point here and stacking the other point over there you see the mouse pointer is changing.",
            "Those very easy graphically checked whether this matches and then what I mentioned before.",
            "Depending on the sector that you're going to model, we have to model the whole pair, so that's why we get these type of symmetry, and I'd like to get this one involves sooner or later tomorrow in the heart of the pole pair, but that's not possible for this machine today, so we just do that.",
            "Up with many other machines you can work with the whole parent, but not for the claw.",
            "OK, if you have done this, you get these two entries in a tree.",
            "One is for master and the other one is for slaves.",
            "And if you click on that to highlight thing so just you can visualize what you've done and in the detail window service more here.",
            "You would get an idea of the relation between master and slave, so we see that here the field quantity and master in slave they should both match.",
            "So the age field on the slave slide matches the age field on the on the master side, so that's OK.",
            "So the other boundary conditions.",
            "I would assume that these are flux parallel boundary conditions and once again that's that's our engineering task.",
            "We have to check whether this is valid top surface here.",
            "As well as the bottom surface here on the other side of things, will describe the region of interest that the whole field.",
            "The whole energy is inside of that region.",
            "If we click this very close to that bindings here, this stray field is gonna be compressed into box that you were going to model.",
            "So if you're interested, let's say for Lawrence forces into the windings, it is important to correctly model the stray fields.",
            "Same true if you want precision to censor those did not.",
            "Here you're interested in the field gradient in that wage for these type of applications, please make sure to get not too close with boundary conditions to your region of interest.",
            "In our case, what we want to do is we want to connect or I'm going to specify the internal flux distribution because this is important and responsible for the induced voltage and later on for them for the charging current.",
            "Deflux that's Only Connect with any binding region is neglectable, so we do not care about this with too much.",
            "You can check this later on, but that's my experience.",
            "So under these circumstances it's absolutely sufficient to specify a flux parallel boundary condition for the remaining three boundaries, and that's naturally so we don't have to do anything, but at least we should check.",
            "OK, the next step would be excitation.",
            "And that's a little bit cumbersome because we have a number of windings, so we have to specify for each winding once their excitation.",
            "Before doing so, I just want to clean up the screen a little bit.",
            "I'm just using master and slave and use these.",
            "I functions here with the red function to simply hide them.",
            "Because I do not longer need them, at least not for visualization.",
            "Anne.",
            "Maybe we can also hide the solid structures, but only this.",
            "So we're going to do now is we specify for every winding you see we have 5, five plus year.",
            "I'm going to select one here.",
            "See that here we have to specify how is these whining excited?",
            "It's a single binding so we have to get some current into these.",
            "Number of single wires?",
            "OK. How can we?",
            "How can we do that?",
            "How can we get some current inside of these closed loop?",
            "Right now this one as well as this one is close to 1.",
            "Terminal is sufficient in some former versions.",
            "We need to buy 2.",
            "One is sufficient an at least I should mention that there is there is some regions like like that one here.",
            "The end region here maybe.",
            "Where these coil is not one solid, it consists of two solids.",
            "Future Cemetery fact, even for those it is sufficient to specify only one terminal.",
            "I prepared a number of more terminals so we do not need to have to actually use all of them, so they have to grab the proper ones.",
            "The direction should be proper and then nothing could go wrong so.",
            "Having done this, which other program?",
            "Please insert some winding its quality, acceptation.",
            "We have to have windings.",
            "How many windings do we have to have?",
            "Well, it's a pleasure coil winding.",
            "We have 5 on the one side and we have one at the other side, so it's obviously 6.",
            "OK, so we have 256 times these type of winding I.",
            "For the excitation you can choose an average rename.",
            "I call whining, which is called wind X.",
            "And by doing so, all of these windings inside of Maxwell you have a number of options.",
            "What is important, if we describe the winding?",
            "Well, if we talk about the winding, we already automatically made some assumptions and these idea.",
            "Then because I expect that the winding consists of a number of separate wires, and I also expect that there is a nearly homogeneous.",
            "Distribution in these regions.",
            "If you do not want to do this modeling, this comegys block is not realistic.",
            "You have to model the single one, but if you do so, this structure automatically becomes stranded.",
            "So it's very obvious that if you talk about wires and windings that connect these wires, we might want to have a stranded winding.",
            "The other part will be is solid and is solid is of interest.",
            "Whenever we have some solid blocks, some Eddy current region.",
            "Expected non homogeneous region and non homogeneous.",
            "We distribution of Eddy currents.",
            "OK, in that case for the excitation we know occurrence or current is OK. Just want to open their checkbooks here to see if we can also drive voltage and we can use later on.",
            "We have to we have to use external as a parameter to connect the windings with some external circuits.",
            "OK, but the current is OK here.",
            "And we can type in some parameter here.",
            "EX as we did before and then the definition is correct.",
            "So that's the winding.",
            "The program asks what is the excitation current.",
            "So in that case it's 5 amps.",
            "We know that.",
            "Excitation is 5 amps.",
            "That's for the excitation winding.",
            "So having done this, we got one excitation winding.",
            "It's not connected to any terminal, that's right, but I want to continue first with the definition of the winding.",
            "Later on we associate these windings with some toners, so please proceed pretty much similar for the other windings.",
            "But one thing that's actually important, please make sure that you use the similar convention with the names than I do here.",
            "We know that they have five phase system and I gave the circuit elements already.",
            "Some names that makes it easier in class so.",
            "The first place should give a name, face a second BC, and so on up to D. Please use exactly the same syntax.",
            "Otherwise we have to adjust the circuit connection later on.",
            "And the setting should be stranded and external.",
            "And by doing so, the user cannot specify any current, voltage or whatever love, but you might want to be able to adjust the initial value.",
            "Well if we start up the machine, we know that the current in the secondary causes zeros, not values OK?",
            "So this needs to be done five times, so I'm just copying this one because I do not want to do that all the time and unfortunately we have to add some more windings.",
            "So just do this for B.",
            "Hope Solo, make sure you do not do what I did here.",
            "I have to rearrange that one.",
            "See and all of these faces should be externals.",
            "Be curious, we need to connect them.",
            "So it's all about the same, giving you these already give me.",
            "Dude.",
            "At the end you should have.",
            "Face A2 E. And.",
            "On the other side, the excitation winding.",
            "All of these are stranded windings.",
            "We hope this a little bit here.",
            "It might be a little bit bigger that we can read all the parameters because there is a number of points.",
            "Please make sure that you check that all of these winding cerol strategies can simply validate this by clicking through just checking external stranded and the only thing that has an exception here is there.",
            "Think citation winding which has a node current but doesn't change overtime.",
            "So we can specify a fixed value here.",
            "Why do we need these?",
            "Face 8.",
            "Yeah, his initial current is here in force, you know is 0 because at the beginning of the operation of the flux connection is 0 and we know induced voltage would relate to a change in flux.",
            "At the beginning we start from zero.",
            "There is applications specially for asynchronous machines where we can speed up the convergency to reach steady state by providing a proper initial value.",
            "But we have to notice in that case.",
            "Do not know how that works, so leave 0, doesn't matter.",
            "What do we need to have external?",
            "Well, I showed this at the at the introduction slide.",
            "We have to connect these windings.",
            "When did with the diodes?",
            "And.",
            "This way it's most easiest to use some circuit, otherwise we have to model some strange windings here, which doesn't make sense, and that's the common way.",
            "OK, everybody has connected windings or create the windings.",
            "The more common sense that step is we have to connect terminals to those windings, and that's a carefully done job that we need to do carefully.",
            "The procedures.",
            "That way we have already defined these segments.",
            "If I'm zooming in, you might want to see that here.",
            "This highlighted region here is terminal ABCDE.",
            "OK so it goes that way.",
            "So the only thing that you need to do is you need to.",
            "Select one after another and.",
            "Create a coil terminal from that.",
            "OK, I'm starting with a so I'm creating.",
            "In a.",
            "And just just just to make it possible to do some checking here, please, I'm typing in a maid.",
            "Or you can have winding A or Germany lay whenever you want.",
            "But what we need to do at the end is we need to associate these terminal to that winding.",
            "So that's the story.",
            "And if you talk about windings, then we discussed this before and every winding should consist of a number of conductors.",
            "So for the secondary side we have 10 whining.",
            "Here you have two options.",
            "You can specify a variable, reuse the variable or type in a fixed value like 10.",
            "Here I'm doing it 10.",
            "And at least I just want to mention we need to care about that.",
            "Accused this sooner or later determines how the circuit needs to be designed.",
            "And in that way we will adjust this later on.",
            "So I leave the richer set up to make it easier here.",
            "And I want you to proceed similar to be.",
            "So just simply do the same one for B.",
            "Pop 2 The last one, so let's see how how fast will just do it.",
            "Just do it carefully please.",
            "Di.",
            "And finally.",
            "It's E. Abcd.",
            "OK, now our excitation block consists of a number of windings.",
            "Well, we specified that stranded winding.",
            "And on the other side, we had the terminals that now need to be connected.",
            "OK, if you have to find all the terminals, please validate.",
            "Of these terminals, or.",
            "Having the same number from doctors and.",
            "Make sure that they are all pointing outwards to the terminal.",
            "One in principle there would be no difference between inward and outward.",
            "But if you want to.",
            "Continue with already prepared circuit.",
            "Then the orientation is important.",
            "My circuit is prepared.",
            "In terms of their points out of the terminal.",
            "And finally, there's one more step, and then we will finish with excitation.",
            "While we have to add every Terminal 2 winding and certainly clicking on that, choose the one that's going to be associated with that one.",
            "This is.",
            "Speedy.",
            "By doing this I at least.",
            "Easily figure out that I missed one terminal that's called expectation, so we need to have one more terminal for the expectation.",
            "That we need to continue.",
            "At least I forgot about.",
            "Not sure whether you did call this X and the excitation consists not of 10 Y.",
            "Another whining for the expectations at 100 S till this machine.",
            "Is 100 and then we can associate this terminal also to the remaining.",
            "So finally what we have done is we specified windings.",
            "We specified terminals for their rotating site as well As for the stationary side and on the stationary side.",
            "Please make sure that we have 100 and it points into the terminal.",
            "It's only prepared.",
            "Any questions up to that point?",
            "Do you see the user is responsible defining at least one terminal for each of the whining.",
            "The program automatically cares about the symmetry, so we do not have to adjust both windings that are separate blocks.",
            "There is automatically constraint equation internally.",
            "But still we need to care about the direction.",
            "OK. Next step.",
            "I'm just waiting till everybody's finished.",
            "Just give me a minute I give you in common problems.",
            "So what I would recommend use proper names.",
            "If possible.",
            "And you can avoid problems here.",
            "And one thing, if you have done this, please change that the orientation is the same as the orientation doesn't match.",
            "We get something that is not realistic.",
            "Like on the real machines, we change the Journal somewhere OK?",
            "If you don't have any question, I'm going to proceed right.",
            "Good morning.",
            "This one yeah.",
            "OK, so that's that's the winding.",
            "Its up to make it a little bit bigger so it's a strange if it has a variable.",
            "But you can also have a fixed value of 5X.",
            "It is only one federal branch, but.",
            "Internally, the terminal associated 100.",
            "Windings and was actually points into John Locke.",
            "For the other one, we had 10 windings and was outwards.",
            "This one is $100.",
            "OK. Good one.",
            "So.",
            "Next step I'm going to continue with meshing well, we're almost done anyway, meshing and then the solution set up and run.",
            "OK, meshing this type of analysis is a set, does not care about remesh.",
            "So now it's really important that we define mesh.",
            "And we in matches.",
            "The type of analysis we we want to do so the specification of these mesh parameters is more important than within method before when the program is doing it by themselves.",
            "So you then we have to spend a little bit of time here.",
            "But we want to minimize the effort here as well.",
            "There's some question.",
            "Phoenix.",
            "Determinism?",
            "This excitation that stuff there's only one because this the excitation winding there's only one.",
            "So for the operation mode, that's that's the one that gets the stationary 5 M that creates the field.",
            "And on the other side, we get the the secondary warning that measures and uses the field variation for the rotation.",
            "OK. Just do the meshing.",
            "Well, for the matching itself I want to start with some initial Max settings.",
            "I didn't specify this before, but at least this example really helps us.",
            "So if we go in the empty matchbox here there is initial mesh settings.",
            "These initial mesh settings specify how the measure behaves without any local definition.",
            "We've seen this before.",
            "We get a match, it simply builds or district size geometry, but it does not build exactly the geometry.",
            "We have seen this with some contour plots because the contour was somehow hidden underneath the geometry, so there is not a one to one match what the program is doing.",
            "The program projects mesh with the geometry projection means that there is a tolerance and we can adjust these tolerances manual.",
            "We can have it more relaxed or more strict.",
            "What you see here is.",
            "It's kind of like my typical values for this type of application to create a mesh.",
            "That does not have too many elements and nodes.",
            "I want to use this type of value.",
            "That means OK that any of the nodes can have mismatched with the geometry of oh point 1 millimeter.",
            "Well for sensor applications will be critical if you're talking about tiny dimensions, which for one application like this one and some more like that one open 1 millimeter of the curvature doesn't care so that we can easily do the same one for the invasion of normal direction for the curved and this one here helps me.",
            "To tell the program that the aspect ratio of the created elements is not too bad, so we get some not too strong distorted elements 2 three is nearly ideal factor.",
            "Creating better elements if we discuss about matching, at least I need to mention that this program has internally and number of measures for those of us who has been using Maxwell for number of years, always had his hopeful classic measure.",
            "The classic measure creates lower number of elements between homogeneous mention discretization.",
            "Last two years we get an improved Tower Corp meshing method and for most of these CAD parameters I would recommend using the towel, But the Tao is automatically used so you do not have to switch back to.",
            "Classic measure is only required if you get some mesh problems, so you at least know this and I want to keep the default.",
            "There's nothing that we need to do.",
            "So.",
            "If you want to continue with the with the meshing you should not proceed here.",
            "I'm just doing it here on my machine just to just to see I need to add a solution set up.",
            "We need to do this anyway later on, but don't matter and then I can.",
            "Say apply measure parations, this step now creates an initial mesh based on the initial mesh settings.",
            "It's just to show you something that we can improve later on so you don't have to do this.",
            "What we need to do is we can put our engineering knowledge to tell a program where we do.",
            "We have a fine mesh density already.",
            "We have a global disk image density.",
            "OK, we're obviously interested in zooming out.",
            "In the most accurate description.",
            "Just hiding these two objects.",
            "And I'm also hiding all the all the other ones, just to make it easier.",
            "We are actually interested in how the flux is gonna be connected with all these lines.",
            "So the region where the flood stage one goes out to the other side is the most critical region.",
            "Yeah, the backside is not really interested because it is not obvious that the material with SED rate same as the inside.",
            "The claw is not really the region of interest.",
            "Typically it's the region pretty close to the air gap, so that's.",
            "The case, or that's actually.",
            "Kind of prepared due to the fact that I specified not only one's data, which will highlight here.",
            "It is a statement that does not contain the tip of the truth here.",
            "So for many applications where you want to calculate talks or even fluxes, it is helpful to separate the back from the region that is close to the area that minimizes the effort of defining size.",
            "So what I'm going to do is I'm specifying one.",
            "Mesh size for these.",
            "And one for the back.",
            "And as I can do the similar procedure for the other side, this is the back and these are the top sides for the claw.",
            "I'm doing this as a combination for the rotor and stator so So what I'm going to do here is on 1st selecting.",
            "So with these two that makes it easier.",
            "4413 and this later, and we know these regions are of minor interest.",
            "So what's obvious we use this say OK, apply match operation inside length based.",
            "And will you have an error that we can measure?",
            "I'm just inside it's inside, well inside is obvious because it's a volume.",
            "Yeah, we want to specify the discretization inside the structure.",
            "Going to make a slower doesn't matter, so select these two pieces right mouse button, apply mesh inside and there's only one option and then these 12 millimeter would be sufficient, maybe 14.",
            "It's a very coarse mesh with that's sufficient for this type of workshop class here.",
            "Well, the other parts like these stator and this one here which are close to the air gap.",
            "We should specify a smaller mesh size, like also inside and I would actually go for a value like 4, maybe 3, which is the name of that we need to have, because we know that this is a region of the highest field gradient, obvious, right?",
            "Thank you.",
            "So this is the two steps I would do for there.",
            "For the steel parts you want to do, this is not necessary, but you can actually kind of can do that.",
            "I can use kind of sizing also fall of the windings, same as inside.",
            "And I would also use these 12.",
            "So I have 12 millimeter sizing for the wine, Islamophobic, or ports that are not important, and these 4 millimeters for the region of interest.",
            "Just going to show you, maybe as I already have a mesh.",
            "Going to plot the mess here.",
            "OK, see that.",
            "These are measured.",
            "Models in geometry, but this was just a test to see whether the geometry is measurable at all and the next one would be if we have specified these sizes here.",
            "I would recommend everybody to insert an analysis system.",
            "Just doing it here again.",
            "So if you have specified the meshing, please add a solution set up.",
            "Do not care about some time steps.",
            "Right now.",
            "We continue with this later on, which is careful matching and if you have these analysis set up, the program allows us to apply the measure operations.",
            "At least now we see OK whether it's mentioned.",
            "Let me get an idea.",
            "OK.",
            "So the meshing itself.",
            "Computational resources, not sure how fast your machines are.",
            "Typically 22 minutes.",
            "And it gets rid of that.",
            "Any questions regarding mission?",
            "In this case, we have to.",
            "From originally Ranger.",
            "Stepdaughter from one season to perform office.",
            "Yeah, if we if there is.",
            "Possible yet, but if if this region on the claw and then I call this the tip of the claw, which is that small reach on top towards.",
            "Would be part of 1 solid.",
            "I cannot tell the program people need to be creative.",
            "Final match here in low global over there.",
            "So it is possible, sure, but then there is some more action required to get the message that I wanted to have.",
            "Otherwise you might want to create some more elements than I actually need it.",
            "One typical thing is it's a 3D model on that 3D model that says on oh 500,001 million elements and you run a number of time steps.",
            "It may take awhile, so my goal was finally to have something at once here in that machine to get someone stationary position in 20 minutes, even 10 minutes.",
            "So that's why I'm just noting it down, OK?",
            "Good so you should have a mesh and to display the match I would recommend that you select all the solid parts but not the vacuum parts and then use the right mouse button to save plot mesh.",
            "Then everybody has a chance to to visualize that mesh.",
            "Go to change.",
            "Gonna change the color here.",
            "Maybe that's better for the beamer.",
            "They then you can get an idea what's what's going on here.",
            "So we definitely see in the in the inner region that matches summer final, then operation that was actually going to happen.",
            "If somebody asks how many elements and nodes we have, because this gives an idea on how long the simulation time might be.",
            "If you want to grab this information, you're going to set up.",
            "And then there is a right mouse button that calls match that it sticks.",
            "That's at the low end and then match to test.",
            "It gives you an idea how many nodes and elements approximately idea for experienced users to determine how long analysis might take.",
            "If it's not too nonlinear and unpredictable.",
            "Now that's for meshing.",
            "I think that's nearly done.",
            "There's two things or three things that are missing now.",
            "Till till we start the analysis and when we can we can run.",
            "The first thing is we talk up there.",
            "Motor should somehow rotate.",
            "We didn't specify that next, so we have to insert these motion set up.",
            "We need to connect these external winding because we specified.",
            "Then there is some external winding.",
            "We have to tell what is the connection and for sure we have to tell the program about the simulation time.",
            "These are the remaining steps.",
            "Let's start with the first one.",
            "The first one is about specifying the motion object.",
            "And I said before we have these bands I'm clicking on this and what you see here is this band object covers.",
            "This part of the structure that's going to be rotated or motion.",
            "So it's inside of our solution domain, but it encloses all pieces that are going to be rotated later on.",
            "And it's very common to give them the name band, so to specify emotion, set up what you need to do is you click on band right mouse button and then you have the sign band.",
            "And this.",
            "Attributes allows the program to know OK what's going to be done next.",
            "The code allows us not only to rotation.",
            "Also lost.",
            "Do some translation and stuff.",
            "So we switched to rotation from that coordinate system here at all.",
            "We see that the axis of rotation should be set global set OK, positive.",
            "It's the way that is OK for us here.",
            "And then we have some more tips we can adjust the initial position, which we do not have to do.",
            "We can have some limit or continuous rotation, so there's obviously no limit.",
            "And we can also specify some fix it also T or we can consider some mass damping to describe some startup behavior.",
            "In our case here we simply want to tell the program OK, you want to have 2400 RPM.",
            "I'm fixed.",
            "I'm going to velocity.",
            "Sign.",
            "So that's all.",
            "Once again, what we have to do is we have to select the object that we want to have everything inside is going to be rotated like mouse button is sign band.",
            "And while you can do, only do this once, so obviously that by having done this and you will get in motion objects and you can specify the properties of that motion object, it should be rotation, global set and the velocity should be true 2400 RPM OK. Just make sure that you have set up this one.",
            "And if you want to check with everything is OK or not, you can click on to motion setup one.",
            "Here you should get these type of a picture and if you click on moving one then it should get highlighted.",
            "The internal parts and in our enclosure we have more than one body that's going to move, so we should make sure that the program detaches or determines the proper ways.",
            "That's it for the motion set up.",
            "OK, just to be safe.",
            "Do more things.",
            "I've done the motion set up.",
            "This is one thing is connection with the circuit and then.",
            "There is a transient error.",
            "OK, this circuit connection just showing you this one here.",
            "You don't.",
            "You do not have to follow me.",
            "Just showing this one I already gave you popular.",
            "What's up here?",
            "It's the first time, but we don't need this one.",
            "This one shows the circuit, so the one that I showed you on the on this slide.",
            "And these circuit has one element for every winding office that has some resistance which represents the winding resistance.",
            "These windings are connected with certain scheme and then we have these rectifier him with this diode with a certain diode model on top of here and then there is a fixed voltage source.",
            "We're driving a battery that's typically the case and we have a measurement device here that counts.",
            "For sums up, the total charging current.",
            "So finally we want to go.",
            "We want to measure that current that is created from the magnetic field it's connected with all these windings.",
            "From our five element solutions and connected here with this circuit.",
            "So the circuit is already prepared when you wanna use Maxwell.",
            "You can open these circuit editor and you can create your own circuits.",
            "Is not really tough part.",
            "You know you have.",
            "The number of components here simply dragging and dropping that class that straight forward, and be sure that use the naming convention for these elements here.",
            "That's the important part.",
            "If you have done this, you can export.",
            "Net list and if you do show these netlists, creates an SPH file which is similar to the one that you already have, so you don't have to do that.",
            "If I said it, we have these CBH file that consists of the netlist or contains and at least from that circuit.",
            "Just to visualize, I opened that one here.",
            "So that's that SPH one here.",
            "So what we're going to do is we're just something going expectation.",
            "And now connect the external circuit without windings.",
            "Melody available here that allows to edit these external circuit.",
            "We don't have something to edit.",
            "We didn't have anything that's connected.",
            "We see here all of the windings that have these flag which are external and then we can import a circuit and rather than importing a circuit we simply inserting that.",
            "SPH file.",
            "So.",
            "Right mouse button on excitation winding external winding down.",
            "Because these things are winding.",
            "Set up an import and then we specify this CBH file from the file that you have OK. Just say OK. Hopefully you get a message similar to mine, and if you have done this then we see that the program automatically matches with these names.",
            "So yes, some elenbaas inactivity because, well, why is 1 individual?",
            "And the rest is done by the naming convention.",
            "And we have some more information that file.",
            "We have an parameter, it's just to get an idea.",
            "We can use parameters with these fires also because there has been some resistivity in that circuit.",
            "So we have a parameter here for the visibility.",
            "And finally we can see where is the \u03a0 connected it's DHCP file at the end.",
            "OK, so having done this, these external.",
            "Winding sheer on now connected with a certain procedure that is specified in at CBH file, characterizing and at least.",
            "In the analysis that we're going to continue, these circuit description is going to be part of the field equations later on, because we have to solve it's intensely, but everything is specified here.",
            "OK, just go to safe.",
            "And then.",
            "We have to tell the program what we want to solve.",
            "We already have a solution set up.",
            "And we have to tell locate the program or go install.",
            "Well, the most the most critical part that the end user needs to specify is the time step, because the time step determines what are the proper positions where the field is going to be evaluated.",
            "What we want to do is we want to get the fields.",
            "Let's connect between rotor and stator.",
            "We want to measure the flux linkage for the coils we want to measure.",
            "These change of the flock of language you want to get some induced voltages and therefore.",
            "Occurrence, so it's pretty much important to have time steps that are appropriate small enough to cover these information.",
            "If you know the number of polar pairs, if you know the electrical symmetry, then you actually know what's the minimum time step code period of the signal.",
            "So it's very important to get an idea about this and what I recommend is always using at least 12, maybe 20 time steps per sinas for.",
            "If you haven't lower number, you will not get any single makes sense.",
            "12 is something that we do for three phase machines always for these five phase machines maybe.",
            "20 is something that really matters.",
            "So now I have to check what the.",
            "What the machine is, I did not remember that number or that can easily figure out.",
            "Hopefully.",
            "No.",
            "Not in there.",
            "Is not my machine.",
            "That's two minutes, 5 just I have to guess.",
            "I didn't specify this at Stanford.",
            "Two E -- 5.",
            "Seconds.",
            "And oh, .01 second, at the end time.",
            "For every of these time steps with it fixed, increment here.",
            "The program runs the single analysis until that point is reached.",
            "We can stop at any point.",
            "We can continue, but the program only saves some field quantities.",
            "If we tell the program, it should do this.",
            "This voice lot of data, or typically, if we're interested in charts, we do not have to store the field quantities.",
            "If you have 10,000 time steps, none of us can evaluate these.",
            "A lot of information in terms of field quantities and in space, so it's very common that users define your own your number of time points to check the fields to do some possibility checks or do some post processing for the acoustics we have to do.",
            "I'm going to explain this later on, but for this type of analysis where we want to drive some currents, it is not possible.",
            "It's not needed to define any field quantity, so we can leave it empty.",
            "Then you get only the last time point you get no information in between.",
            "You should be aware of that one.",
            "OK, and then there's some more tabs.",
            "Just leaving this one.",
            "At least I want to mention that we have in nonlinear residual because we're now solving some nonlinear problem and there is some Newton raphson schemas embedded with the convergency criteria.",
            "That nonlinear residual is exactly the value that it just allows us at the end you will do just the accuracy.",
            "For the typical applications that connect fluxes, these value might be sufficient, but if you want to characterize something like a cogging torque would definitely recommend.",
            "Kind of much smaller value.",
            "Otherwise, you only get too much noise in the signal, so this is something like I would use for cogging torque evaluation for doing fluxes like this one, the default is sufficient.",
            "Just giving idea.",
            "And then that's it.",
            "So finally what you have done?",
            "You have done the analysis, please do is safe and for those who want to start the analysis, please do check more.",
            "First you get at least one question.",
            "This one here that should have everybody.",
            "This reminds us that we did not carefully tell a program whether we want to have any current or not.",
            "We didn't talk about this really, so the program checks this, which is actually nice functionality because it helps to want mistakes.",
            "Just to show you where it is, you can specify any effect same as callers and immobilization.",
            "If you click into that you will see these are the possible pieces that might have some Eddy current effects.",
            "These are winding bodies.",
            "That's natural, but we decide for this type of analysis.",
            "Now we do not want to care for this.",
            "OK, so simply say OK, we started thinking we finished and if we now do it again you will see the program recognizes our internal discussion and thankfully there's an OK sign.",
            "OK, I've done that the last four days.",
            "Simply running the analysis.",
            "Are there any questions to them?",
            "What's up?",
            "System for Asian.",
            "Is set up for the rotation.",
            "Emotion setup consists of, well, we specified the band as a solid.",
            "This object is available as a solid and then we use the right mouse button to insert these motion and emotion.",
            "Setup itself describes that there is the rotation in global coordinates.",
            "Axis of rotation is set positive direction and.",
            "Not really, expect the initial annual position is 0.",
            "And there's also groups.",
            "We have to specify the angular velocity, that's all.",
            "Blu Ray.",
            "OK, so now the program starts the analysis.",
            "First of all it creates dimension again with this bend object and then it runs time step time step.",
            "We should expect that these analysis runs number of minutes.",
            "I did some testings before we might want to expect it on my machine.",
            "It runs 1020 minutes whatever.",
            "So it's definitely a small model.",
            "We can have even bigger ones.",
            "Not sure what the class work, but it's an annual problem so we should see that there is some more iterations needed to get a converged result.",
            "The positive thing, and that's why when I finish up here while the analysis is running, we can insert results I already told you that we cannot get some field quantities, but we can at least get some quantities that are not part of the field solution.",
            "But all these quantities.",
            "Well, obviously these are integral values that are connected, for example with the with the whining.",
            "So what we can get is we can get it trends in report.",
            "Which is nothing else in the chart or graph's rectangular plot consisting of some winding information and the winding.",
            "Allows us to specify, for example, the current in these three windings because of the structure rotates flux linkage that changes.",
            "It will create some current for each binding.",
            "We have these terminals so we can measure this.",
            "OK so we can install that one.",
            "We could also some just having a bigger here.",
            "You can also have some induced voltage.",
            "For these, adding another report So what you see is you can get a number of data and you will get these life for each step that the analysis is running so we can adjust some miss settings here.",
            "Analysis, running and for sure another value of interests might be the global torque.",
            "So there is also some rectangular plot possible for the talk.",
            "Going to have the moving 12 one.",
            "Glass bottom here.",
            "In other words.",
            "OK, so these are the information that we can get while it's running.",
            "And this allows us to track.",
            "Finally.",
            "There is 1 information that was actually the goal of the analysis.",
            "It was a charging current right?",
            "So how do you get a charging current?",
            "That's the one thing that we need to have.",
            "It's the same procedure, right mouse Button Transit report and you will recognize that there is one entry that's called branch current branch current allows us to grab information from the circuit.",
            "Modify element and we embed it.",
            "Some some empire meter onto structure.",
            "So if you go on there.",
            "Then we get.",
            "The function of the charging current overtime.",
            "While the nurse is runs, we will see how these charging current develops and we have to wait a little bit until we get a stationary situation because we want to describe if exchange rotational velocity and then they should get in stationary single.",
            "And this only is the signal that we wanted value.",
            "Hope you can see, here's.",
            "We just see there.",
            "Our circuits are switching with the dialects in the different phases.",
            "Well, the time steps will happen.",
            "Obviously a little bit too small, so I need to adjust them a little bit.",
            "And also we see that the current source somehow changing due to the switching of the diodes.",
            "I need to be channel, so that's what we expect.",
            "What type it takes, at least on.",
            "The Times of the analysis time we have here till it gets a converged status because the electrical signal is not periodic in that sector.",
            "Here.",
            "That's why I said OK, it takes 1020 minutes, not even this one to be happy.",
            "So that's what we get.",
            "And finally we expect kind of charging current should be above 6 amps, 6 amps, so it goes in proper direction my case.",
            "We need a few more seconds to get these 6 apps.",
            "So this workshop just I hope it actually gives you an idea.",
            "How are we call it easy?",
            "Easy it is to solve some dynamic field problems in Maxwell.",
            "If you kept some basic knowledge setting up the transient in terms of motion is very easy deal.",
            "It takes some some work to connect windings and just should mention that we can connect internal model bindings with some circuits.",
            "So it's little engineering work before we can also connect these windings with some direct circuit model or like simple or to get some advance circuit modeling.",
            "For machines I would not do that.",
            "And while the rest is about matching and simulation, if you have computational resources like we have in your environment, it's not really a problem.",
            "Solving this this type of analysis, if you know the proper setup.",
            "Why do I going to do this?",
