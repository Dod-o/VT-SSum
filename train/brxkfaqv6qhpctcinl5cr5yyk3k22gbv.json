            "So this presentation was originally only about Mike Research, which is a research prototype that I developed.",
            "But I'm going to tell you a little bit about search monkey, which is a product from from Yahoo itself, and it features some of the ideas behind Mike Research, so you might be interested in seeing how an idea from research have been implanted in in a product, but in a slightly different way.",
            "Then, of course it was imagined by the researcher.",

            "So just to give you a very brief overview what's what's going on here first I would like to say that this stock is a bit different from the previous talk and that it's not going to be about changing the core search algorithms that we're using, but I'm going to talk about how to change the interface that is being used by the search engine.",
            "So what we've seen before is two kinds of trends in search.",
            "If you will.",
            "One is horizontal search, where you find the big search engine providers like Yahoo, Google, Microsoft, where basically large scale crawling and indexing is performed and matching is almost always keyword based.",
            "So very simple, but very fast techniques.",
            "And in this domain that have been limited experiments with ontologies mostly using ontologies for for query expansion with some success.",
            "On the other hand, what you find is.",
            "Is the domain of vertical search, which is to say search focus on on particular domains such as shopping where you have basically a richer representation of the objects that the user is looking for and also richer richer query query interfaces and result displays but limited to a particular domain.",
            "And there are some combinations which try to do vertical search on a web scale.",
            "So in this category you find something like Google Base or Google Cop.",
            "Which is web scale but again fixed to particular domains.",
            "So there are certain kind of items you can you can upload to Google Base for example, and there are certain kinds of properties you can use to describe those objects, but it's still limited to those objects and those properties.",
            "So the question is then, can we do better with semantic web technologies?",
            "It is particular addressing the long tail of queries I can actually quote a number from a paper by by Riccardo and so my colleagues in Barcelona.",
            "Who have done some query log analysis and actually found that 88% of the unique queries are basically asked once in a year.",

            "Because sometimes discussions arise between people who talk about one part of the vision versus people talk about the other part of the vision.",

            "And slightly different techniques apply to this to these two cases, so that's why it's important to distinguish them, and this presentation is going to be about the annotated web.",

            "The problem is that it's not a particularly good interface for any particular query, right?",
            "So I will be very hard pressed to find a single query to which the answer is is an ordered list of 10 pages, right?",
            "So maybe if someone asked for the first 10 pages, the Bible and you have to return it in order and exactly those 10.",
            "Maybe that's an example.",
            "But otherwise, if you think about, for example, the experience that you get when you type in Pablo Picasso in a search engine and experience, you get in Wikipedia for Pablo Picasso, there is a world of difference in terms of presentation in how the content is put together, how multimedia items are placed, how information is presented according to the type of of information.",
