            "Next step would be we run through these typical simulation process.",
            "Well, every simulation process consists of describing geometry, providing a proper setup.",
            "In that case, providing the description of the boundary problem to solve our low frequency magnetic field problem, and finally then we saw a solution and after the solution started we expect to get some results.",
            "That's what we're going to do that, so that's always follows the same procedure.",
            "That's why we have these blocks.",
            "And to work with these blocks to activate Maxwell we simply double click in that case on geometry, because there was a question mark and by doing so, the software stored up.",
            "So everybody should get an empty Maxwell 3D.",

            "We get all the error messages here and then we have that we view here and we have the details window containing several days before the information and this part here in the middle is the one that we care for the geometry, so that's what I'm doing.",

            "Different formats that have been commissioned before about importing other CAT data.",
            "You will see that by pushing import you get a number of files.",

            "In that case I think we should go for a parasolid file because I provided parasolid file.",
            "And that parasolid file is exactly at the location where we saved it before.",

            "So please point your import to the appropriate directory that you have been chosen before and tell the program to open that files.",

            "You're working with external cat data.",
            "We know that there is some uncertainty, some tolerances in geometry, and the 2K has an embedded functionality to allow some automatic healing, and in default these these are active.",

            "The import might take a few seconds or the one that runs very short time, and if the geometry is clean it should work without any.",
            "So we push open.",
            "And then you see the import happens and if that happens you get the imported geometry ready on the screen, OK?",

            "This point if you're not well located here, doesn't have any fall field effect that significant into the other portion of all the wheels, so that's why I choose to small portion of them.",
            "Region and then I have two blocks that you will not really easily see that these aurasense forward and backward.",
            "These two more blocks.",
            "And for sure, what we usually see there is a region outside that covers the whole domain.",
            "Is it possible you can import all these geometry contents from an external file?",
            "Or as I mentioned, you can create them internally.",
            "So what we need to do for the for the whole project is.",
            "Open that analysis Tree Hill.",
            "On that flag we need to validate the model.",
            "Describe boundary conditions.",
            "Create an an expectation little bit of mesh.",
            "Do then alloces and then run the post processing.",
            "So when the first time when you work with the software, which one is similar to any CAD package, use that suite installed from top to down.",
            "You can't do anything wrong and as you have also seen in section before, we have these validate button here and it helps users to make sure to recognize.",
            "What do I need to do?",
            "Otherwise I can't run the analysis, so the program somehow guide you to make sure that we will not get lost you anything you will see there is a little bit of work that we have to do on your end.",
            "So OK, first step and just do step by step.",
            "We need to characterize the different domains by describing different material properties.",
            "So we have this solid next step is we provide material properties.",

            "You can continue this by yourself later on, so click on the magnet on the right mask.",
            "But we have this assignment real Bob.",
            "And we have a number of material already defined in the library.",
            "You can have access to the material library by searching squatting, but more easier as you type some some characters here.",

            "Just pick up the analysis and add some solution set up on these setup explains the program, what we're willing to do in the static case, it's obvious that time doesn't have any effect, but pretty much similar to the high frequency analysis we still have the question what is the problem?",
            "Make sure that the gradient is somehow robust regarding any mesh changes and we have the same method available as an ice cream paint analysis.",
            "We have an adaptive meshing procedure and in that bottle we specify the maximum number of passes.",

            "So why is analyzing?",
            "It creates a local job.",

            "Everybody with me.",
            "Then we follow the next step.",
            "We simply use the same one, but we changed the components so it's quality is the same.",
            "We just do an X. Geometry, make sure it's the same.",
            "It's kind of important an and then integrate.",
            "And I like the idea of thought.",
            "We get some feedback here.",
            "So if you doing typo and picking up some wrong sensor, you really see that here.",
            "So make sure that they have both times the same volume to integrate.",
            "OK so that the two lines should only do one difference here.",
            "OK, so the next step would be.",
            "Divide 1 by the other.",
            "And then comes the orchestrations.",
            "OK, so that's on a trigonomic function here in the middle of screen.",
            "And lower functions office timings here.",
            "Pakistan games.",
            "And then it's P. Divides.",
            "And then 180, it's by number because we have to type a number 180.",
            "And finally, do not forget to multiply this this number.",
            "We have to have an operation at the end.",
            "Yeah, so last action would be multiplied and you have everything in one line.",
            "OK.",
            "If you have done this in one line, you can put that add button here and give them a simple name.",
            "Sensor that was a back one.",
            "Aspect just an average rename that grabs these scale value.",
            "It's nothing else than a scalar value that gets out of network.",
            "I'm done.",
            "It manages.",
            "OK, what happens here in that offer box you will get these.",
            "These function that we have saved and we can later on reviews on.",
            "For those we have some problem with these notation.",
            "Take your time.",
            "You can do this a little bit later on by your own.",
            "The basic idea is that you get the information that there was a field Calculator available that allows you to grab all these field quantities, integrate, do some tricky map with that and then provide these back end information.",
            "So if you feel happy to type in HY, just do it.",
            "The program will not care, but you might want to get a different output signal for sure.",
            "OK, you can also save these equations to file so you don't have to type it again 1000 times.",
            "So now I'm just leaving it the way this year.",
            "I'm simply doing it for the for the.",
            "For the second sensor, so I'm just doing it again.",
            "That's all age.",
            "Scalar wine, but I have to make sure that the sensor knows the second one integrate over that.",
            "Using the same quantity, but now the X direction.",
            "With the forward sensor, integrate that one divide.",
            "Use that.",
            "Office Tongans number.",
            "180 and multiply groups, so at the end is pretty much the same equation.",
            "The only difference here.",
            "Because it acts on his certain are the region and then as they add.",
            "And ICS forward.",
            "If you do not want to do this by your own, at least I want you to have at least one component in there that grabs the scale value that we can continue to working with.",
            "Because this is a nice idea.",
            "OK. Everybody with me.",
            "What are the last year?",
            "Location.",
            "On the middle of equation?",
            "Well then it's pretty much easier than I think we we just preceded this way.",
            "I'm going to open this one here on the PowerPoint slide because then you can.",
            "You can simply follow that one.",
            "It's not that hard stuff, but maybe it's easier.",
            "Click on quantity.",
            "Age.",
            "Later then choose from the box wine.",
            "Click on the geometry.",
            "Choose the sensor and then there is an integration slider.",
            "Then do the same one for the other component.",
            "Net.",
            "Yeah, portion of these two equations are divided.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Mathewson, Trigonomic functions well, these points here that we have on this line or not.",
            "Modified science is just a separate between these two actions that perfect one trigonomic one.",
            "Architonic from pull down box.",
            "Then constant P and then.",
            "The division.",
            "And then #180.",
            "And then that's what I mentioned before you have to multiply.",
            "And if you typed in that, just add these equation given name.",
            "OK. Just.",
            "So I give you two or three minutes.",
            "Maybe that you can type in these.",
            "Just tried again and at least it would be nice if that everybody is doing this.",
            "For one, sensor is not need to have this for both, but please try this for at least one sensor.",
            "Because we need to do this to get some post processing done, because this is actually probably the sensor signal.",
            "Are there any questions?",
            "Yeah, this is shaping up, sorry.",
            "Not power switch logic, yeah?",
            "No sense.",
            "Well, I'd say it's it's the way that that the first Texas Instruments devices worked.",
            "So if you're.",
            "The pretty young guy.",
            "And then it's something that you have never done.",
            "Pretty much sure and I would totally agree that they can't do this can be done better, but that's the way it's implemented within the soccer right now, and at least we have the flexibility to have access to all of the field quantities.",
            "That's the important sign for me, and I'm totally sure you have to.",
            "You have to carefully think how to type.",
            "Electric regulator no.",
            "You have to, well, you can write your own scripts while they complete software is Python enables or Visual Basic enabled and you can use these embedded functions.",
            "Create your own Python code, but then you have to make sure that you follow the same syntax.",
            "You will not resolve the problem that way.",
            "Or the procedure is the same because this object structure is the way it is.",
            "What you obviously see one major difference, Maxwell as a code, does not have the complete Workbench interface.",
            "It's not really rebuild the last five years, it contains code for last 1520 years, and that's part of it, so it's going to be rewritten the next years with him tonight.",
            "I would agree that's cumbersome, but that's why what I would do is I type it in once and export this file.",
            "And if I have it export, I can edit this one with an ASCII editor and import again so that won't work.",
            "OK. For those who do not want to do this, simply want to grab the first line here.",
            "Quantity age, scale Y.",
            "And then integrate this over that sensor.",
            "Then you get it.",
            "Once stable value.",
            "It's not the same that I have, but you can at least follow right.",
            "OK, going to continue.",
            "Because we we just want to do the more interesting part which is the claw machine at the end.",
            "Um?",
            "If this quantity is available, we will not see it here because it's a scale value.",
            "So to get to get use of these we can use it fields.",
            "Kind of a table.",
            "Yeah, or we can use an output variable, so there's two things possible.",
            "We know the equation that we typed in provides a scalar value or two scalar values.",
            "I kind of blocked it, but I can specify that these value might become an output variable.",
            "To do some data exchange or I can create some report to get some charts.",
            "Both things were possible.",
            "So in my case I would first check the output variable.",
            "So by doing so I'm going on a result right mouse button I could variable.",
            "And in that outfit, variable automatically sees on the fields or type of report the qualities that I specified.",
            "That's what I did.",
            "Maybe you did something else, and if you want to make them an output variable, the only thing is that you have to do is you have to insert this into an expression.",
            "Oops.",
            "Sorry.",
            "Do not insert this one here and will you give him a name since or back.",
            "Back signal if you want to use the Avatar name.",
            "And this variable now existing exhaustible for whatever you wanna do.",
            "Then you say add.",
            "And this is gonna be processed.",
            "You have seen some actions here.",
            "Now the the value is is some available to the program and I'm only going to do the same one here insert.",
            "Sensor.",
            "Front signal duty organic.",
            "OK, can you see once again you can also derive some some other qualities using that variables with some functions here.",
            "OK, up to now we have specified with.",
            "The Calculator is quite nice and we made these quantities to become an output variable.",
            "We started with the idea that we know that the field here.",
            "German by the adaptive meshing we do not know how accurate this and we still going to get limit the quantities of the fields in that sense of which we want to integrate that.",
            "So to make sure that the result is somehow converged.",
            "I would specify some additional convergence criteria rather than using the global one.",
            "So I'm going to check out the setup going on the properties.",
            "That's one that we had at the beginning where we have these 10 iterations and the global criteria.",
            "And then there is a convergency, and there's an expression cash and with the variables we can use music equations that we have typed in during the adaptive runs and evaluate these quantities.",
            "By doing so, the program hasn't convergency criteria that is more focused to the problem that we're going to solve, rather than anything global.",
            "So the main goal of all these functions for this one of them is that we can now insert here an expression cash.",
            "From that button here.",
            "Use one of them.",
            "Doesn't matter which one, maybe both.",
            "I said at calculation and said Curculation.",
            "This I asked the expression cache running and determine these two variables from iteration to iteration and I can also specify convergence value here to say OK, the maximum difference from one iteration to the other should not be above a certain limit.",
            "But I could do this for both things.",
            "So the idea here is that we specify some local criteria to be used for the convergency and what we have done is we used the field Calculator to specify some equations.",
            "To manage these equation into the expression catch that is evaluated during the runtime and then we activated this button using OK.",
            "It's going to be used for convergence.",
            "OK, that's the one thing.",
            "And for sure, if somebody wants to see the value, maybe uses the post processing volume going up results.",
            "Data table maybe it's available.",
            "And then we have had variables or.",
            "Expression cash we can have extensive expression, but that just simply gives us a number.",
            "So I'm not going to do this year because we finally want to have a function anyway, so it's of no value to grab one single value, but it might be important.",
            "As I said, please do this includes in the set up this expression cash as a criteria as what you can do.",
            "OK.",
            "So having done this.",
            "You can simply rerun the analysis.",
            "My reporting the analysis going to set up right mouse button and there's two options.",
            "The one option is that it simply pushed analyze, then the analysis with the result that we have on the screen.",
            "Right now is simply continued.",
            "Its doesn't start by zero, it starts by new resolve we already have and continues, so it we matches the already re/max structure, if you want.",
            "To be on the safe side, maybe sometimes it's needed to get back so we have a really refer to initial mesh.",
            "Then we start from the initial simulation.",
            "So that's what I'm going to do here.",
            "You then here everything is gone.",
            "And I'm simply saying, OK, just analyze that one and then at once.",
            "Anet should now also check.",
            "The conversions in Critera that we have specified manually.",
            "And this again is typically something that we need to do for sensor applications because we don't have any integral value that is more sensible in the host or you have something local and it's not that easy to get good local field quantities.",
            "While running you will see some post processing activity here from time to time you see that if you if you're very fast, you will see here is evaluating the expression cash.",
            "So after each iteration the expression cash is going to be evaluated and the program has a criteria to decide whether to a border to continue the analysis.",
            "So that's all.",
            "I'm going to do here.",
            "The rest is about.",
            "Creating a parameter curve.",
            "As you want to determine the signal as a function of the precision of the sensor, or we have to do as a final step is we have to rotate and we'll fix the magnific sensor.",
            "And do a number of analysis for different angular positions.",
            "Another choice, so that's what the basic goal is.",
            "So there's a few more steps needed.",
            "The first thing is we have to change the geometry.",
            "We imported geometry, but we still can somehow manipulate the position of that.",
            "So what we need to do is, I said we want to fix the magnets.",
            "I do not want to move the magnet typically in the wheels moving, but from physical point of view there is no difference.",
            "We can also move the magnets, but I would not do this because of one reason that's somehow critical.",
            "If we move the permanent magnet, we also need to take care about the direction of the mechanization.",
            "So if you wrote that one, the globalis direction is still global names.",
            "Not not physical, at least something that we cannot easily realize, so it's much easier for these types of applications like for machines as well.",
            "Rosie and Mom come in my creature.",
            "In that case, that's the that's the weeks.",
            "Simple?",
            "For this model, here we have to take two pieces.",
            "You have to rotate the wheel, but we also have to rotate the region because the wheels fall region, we didn't model the whole wheel assembly.",
            "Should have no trouble to do so.",
            "Please select these two blocks and then it's all about the same procedure, right mouse button and it.",
            "Let me see again.",
            "Now we're going to just.",
            "Geometry is under any and you see we can arrange the existing geometry, so I'm going to do that here arrange and there is a number of functions, but we want to do is we want to rotate that two pieces.",
            "It's very easy.",
            "So put on rotate.",
            "Then the program gives us a first impression what he's gonna be rotated or 90 degrees.",
            "It will be critical.",
            "We should not do 90 degree, but there should be some default.",
            "At least we see that the axis is correct.",
            "Rotation axes Ed and we should not specify my degree here.",
            "What I would do is I would type in a variable.",
            "To make it easier, just simply type in angle.",
            "We can use your own notation here so the program doesn't know what is right the moment we we push.",
            "OK here we get a window while the program asks.",
            "OK, what's the what's the value of that variable?",
            "Anne.",
            "For the first step, maybe we do some 10 degree because then we see something happens between evaluate whether it makes sense or not.",
            "The typing 10 we see it's an angle, it's measuring degree in, the value is 10 right?",
            "The moment when you put OK.",
            "The action starts.",
            "And then you have already see it's going to be rotated.",
            "We see that it's not longer position here.",
            "If you want to play around a little bit with this one, we have specified a variable.",
            "I did this with the name angle.",
            "We should figure out where these variable is gone.",
            "We will find these variable on the project level, so if you click on a Maxwell free design we will get in on Window View all defined internal variables.",
            "So there is a variable angle and when I want to change that one here I simply type in and change it.",
            "And it's evaluating this one so.",
            "It's it's very easy.",
            "Another one set it back to zero just five minutes so you can check these checkings or some are important if you do a parametrised analysis like Christian did, because you have to make sure that these operations are valid in a certain range of your parameters, so at least even if we do not have any idea, you should have ideas about the boundaries of our parameters, so please make sure that you test.",
            "These boundaries before running something on a cluster because this might take a little time and even create some results that are not sense doesn't make sense, so I would play around a little bit.",
            "You see that here it only takes a few seconds, so now the next question would be OK, what we're going to do?",
            "What is the region of interest?",
            "So what is the boundary that we need to evaluate here?",
            "OK, if we come the number of these through here, you know, like if we we easily figure out that there were some symmetry, some periodic signal.",
            "That we expect that is about 15 degree.",
            "OK, that's easy.",
            "So it's up to you.",
            "I would advise to start later on our parametric run from minus 7.5 up to plus 7.5.",
            "It's not important that good here, but it's important to think about to make sure that the setup is done properly.",
            "OK, so that's all for the setup for the geometry.",
            "And finally we have to tell the program that there is some result we want to get back to create these curves.",
            "That's the whole goal.",
            "So we go under option metrics that we have.",
            "This design Explorer setup, and in that Design Explorer setup we cannot access these variables.",
            "We just defined that.",
            "So I'm just doing it again.",
            "It's it's it's under optometrics.",
            "Underneath the analysis there's some design explores set up if you do a double click.",
            "You have all of the defined variables.",
            "We just defined a new one and we can tell the program.",
            "Please include this parameter into a valuation.",
            "Simulation with different parameters.",
            "The other button here which is named alright, allows too.",
            "Alright, an existing variable within Maxwell.",
            "If there is an variable that comes from work went.",
            "It's not needed here because we weren't triggered only once.",
            "So that's the input variable you want to have a function that contains input and output, so the output should be under calculations.",
            "The program doesn't know anything per default.",
            "Or could it?",
            "So we have to set up some calculations.",
            "We have done something we now go on expression cache.",
            "Use the output variables, but going out question cache and get.",
            "The one.",
            "All the other code calculations.",
            "OK. By doing so, we have the output signal that is derived from the equation.",
            "That combined with the Calculator stored in the expression cash, we can bring them back to work.",
            "So one input signal that's the angle to output signals.",
            "That is the signal at the center of backward and forward, that's all.",
            "OK. Then we can say OK and the whole setup is finished less.",
            "That would be safe.",
            "In right, the moment you save, this whole information is going to be imbedded inside work bench and you can leave the program open or closed.",
            "I simply switch back to there.",
            "Toolbox into the to the Workbench tool.",
            "We have seen that there is something done here.",
            "We also got some parameter box here because we added these angle parameter and we have a parameter set here we now can define what are the quantities that we want to evaluate.",
            "So that's the whole story.",
            "And finally, if you want to manually what you can do is you can specify here a number of variables, or you can use the optimization tool like we have done before.",
            "You can also use Excel or any other spreadsheet tool too.",
            "Fill these.",
