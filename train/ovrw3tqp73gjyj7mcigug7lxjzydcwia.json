            "A.",

            "A.",
            "So 'cause the Blanca is interesting, right?",
            "So Casablanca.",
            "Is the Humphrey Bogart movie right?",
            "Pretty good.",
            "It's also a city right in Morocco, so why is it the company?",

            "So if you read it, you'll see it's actually a name of a hotel in Spain.",
            "A. I'm not sure I can pronounce the name of the city, but probably the Spanish people here.",
            "See it say Salou, Spain.",
            "OK. A so it's a pretty cheap hotel.",
            "$32 per night.",

            "What we did we started it by going to a Yahoo news and putting Osama bin Laden in the search box and then it found about 1400 documents that contained Osama bin Laden.",

            "Yes.",
            "Some kind of emotional.",
            "Right?",
            "So, so one of the things that you can do is you can actually associate await with each document.",
            "That basically will reflect the credibility of the source.",
            "So you would say I don't know that Reuters is a pretty credible source, but maybe a personal blog of somebody is not that credible.",

            "I think it's a pretty a subjective.",

            "AM.",
            "So we so the Pope.",
            "And Johnny would be too much, so let's put John Paul.",
            "OK John Paul the 2nd.",
            "Ann, we want to connect the Pope with him.",
            "Zombie London.",
            "OK. Not not this one.",

            "So here we talk about 3 degrees theory.",
            "A.",
            "And we want to see what we'll get.",
            "So way you can see here the relationship between John Paul and Osama bin Laden.",
            "A and you can see the strongest connection actually is this from the use of.",
            "So anybody knows who is Ramzi Yusef?",
            "No.",
            "What?",
            "You do.",
            "OK. No, you saw them.",
            "A so.",
            "Johnpaul in Ramsey Yusuf.",
            "Let's see what's the connection.",
            "So let's see if you remember who is Ramzi Yousef?",
            "Yeah, but who there is a stronger connection.",
            "Ramsey Yusef was the guy that basically did the bombing of the World Trade Center in 93.",
            "If you remember there was a car a so he was the guy in charge of that so far is definitely a strong connection, but you can see also that runs the use of tried to assassinate the Pope using the Abu Sayyaf organization in a Manila Abu Sayyaf is that organization in the Philippines.",
            "And here we can also see the connection between Osama bin Laden and Ramzi Yousef.",
            "Actually you have a lot of connections.",
            "OK, a so this is about this one.",
            "Or is actually a lot more to be shown here, but?",
            "So this is the new thing that I want to show you a.",
            "And if people are interested in using the tool as they said, it's free.",
            "They should just email me and I'll send you the.",
            "How to register and get a tool?",
            "So what's the idea here?",
            "The idea here is a it's a classification tool for documents, but it enables you to build your repository about any domain that you would be interested in.",
            "So here we have a few topics that were already defined.",
            "You can see here a diabetes P2P patterns running.",
            "Of course we talked about running before a VCs, so just a few topics that I did put before.",
            "So let me just show you the classification abilities of the tool.",
            "So what you can do now here are things that are.",
            "I'll go to things that are unclassified.",
            "OK.",
            "So for instance, here a let's take a venture capital software thing which.",
            "We drag it.",
            "Sorry.",
            "Eh, we dragged it here.",
            "And you can see it put 92% as enterprise software and 100% it belongs to VC.",
            "You can see the terms that it extracted from the document.",
            "So what are the different terms that it found from this document that it found relevant to a A?",
            "Software and the VCs.",
            "You can also see the original document.",
            "I don't have a problem with the Internet here.",
            "OK, not sure what's the problem here.",
            "A.",
            "Hope you have some Internet connection because they part of the demo is actually connected to the Internet.",
            "Let's go to something that is related to running.",
            "So, but first let me close this.",
            "A so this is a document that talks about a parallel that I took from one of the discussion boards.",
            "And.",
            "I think I have a problem here.",
            "OK, one second.",
            "A let's try this one.",
            "Yeah, so this is a diabetes.",
            "For instance, you can see it classified it correctly as 99% belonging to this.",
            "A wonder if it was showing it now it shows the document.",
            "OK.",
            "He let's take something else.",
            "A.",
            "This is.",
            "Coffee shops, I doubt if it will match anything, so let's see.",
            "First, let's close it.",
            "Interesting, so it matched actually vessies.",
            "Interesting, now this is this is the old document.",
            "So this document is different.",
            "Yeah, it actually has.",
            "I mean the topic was something about coffee, but it's actually coffee related to VCs, so this is actually white related it to VCs.",
            "A.",
            "Now the interesting thing here is actually the ability to find more documents.",
            "So in addition to a thing, all the documents that were used to train this category, you can actually go to the web and find similar documents to the documents that you have put into your topic.",
            "So if you want I can actually.",
            "I'll take a risk and I'll be the new topic just for you now in real time so we can build it together using some examples and then we'll go to the web to find additional things that are similar to that.",
            "And by that we can actually build a repository of documents that are relevant exactly to the topic I'm interested in.",
            "So anybody has a specific suggestion for a topic?",
            "What?",
            "Coffee and Hill.",
            "I mean, we can do that we I. Porcelain, OK, I'm not sure I know how to sew.",
            "How do you pronounce how you spell it?",
            "CE Postal in I think that would be enough.",
            "A. OK, so we have the porcelaine So what will start doing it?",
            "Hopefully the Internet will work.",
            "Hey will go to Google.",
            "Yes.",
            "And we just need to put the porcelain again.",
            "Porcelain name right.",
            "OK, Wikipedia, that's always good.",
            "So we yeah, we'll take a few examples.",
            "So basically you go here and you drag it to your folder.",
            "So what it will do now is it will process the document, learn all the specific terms that you have inside the document.",
            "And this can be also a PDF or a world file you can get from your hard disk.",
            "This is a pretty long document.",
            "OK, OK, so for instance if we want to see what are the terms.",
            "That we have here you can see here a different terms that it found it found relevant to this.",
            "Since I have known nothing about porcelain.",
            "We'll see.",
            "Hey.",
            "Hey.",
            "The third one OK, OK, so we'll go here.",
            "OK. A.",
            "So now why didn't it edit something I didn't do right?",
            "Oh, I think I dragged it here.",
            "The drugs.",
            "I'm sorry.",
            "OK, I drag it to the drug zone rather than adding it as a training data.",
            "So let's do it again.",
            "I don't do anything with the links.",
            "I mean, currently I basically just take the text and feed it to the system.",
            "Nothing is done with, so we have already 2 items here.",
            "Let's see if the topic terms change as a result of that.",
            "Not so much a definitely.",
            "Porcelain is the best one so you know what.",
            "Let's say that this is enough.",
            "So we basically we say find more.",
            "A in the tools.",
            "I want to show the logs.",
            "Anne.",
            "And I want to also show the queries 2nd.",
            "So let me explain what's happening now.",
            "What you can see now is that it's it's using a.",
            "Currently we use Google, but we will use also a MSN Search and Yahoo search and it's finding documents.",
            "You can see the query that it's used.",
            "Let's see what was the query here, but the query was person in article.",
            "A, but it changes the queries as it goes.",
            "It depends how good the results are.",
            "And what it does, it gives a grade.",
            "How good is the match between the article and the articles that you have in the seed articles that you have?",
            "If it's above 80, it adds those articles automatically to the collection.",
            "OK, so you can see here that the first was 62, didn't discarded.",
            "This was one that was 19, so it added it.",
            "And basically using the feedback discourse that sees it also changes the queries that issues to the search engine.",
            "So basically, if you leave it to go for like a day, you'll get a huge number of documents, but they would pretty much be on target matching the documents that you started with.",
            "OK, and again you can also see the original documents and save it.",
            "You can also upload it a if anybody wants to.",
            "Use and play the with the tool.",
            "Just send me an email and I'll forward you the tool, that's it.",
            "There are some systems that.",
            "Uses taken ography in order to hide meaning sentences.",
            "So, for example, use what I missed the world.",
            "So some bits can be covered.",
            "Lee transmitted by playing, playing with the words are used matters, so it's taken a graphic embedding of coverage, meaning in text.",
            "So one example is for example to pre assign to in an email.",
            "For example the way that you say hello would be.",
            "Certain bits with high would be another certain bits dear whatever, so by using barriers that are meaning more or less the same, one concurrently transmit bits OK, right?",
            "If this can be technical dealt with in some way by note by the things that I showed, I mean this is a pretty specific algorithm that needs to understand how people you know hide a those messages and try to uncover it, but that would be a very specific technique to address something like that.",
            "How large should be your receipt of documents?",
            "How many for this tool?",
            "We found that you know a less than five.",
            "I mean like 4, five would be perfect.",
            "One of the things that we're actually adding with would be in the next version is the usage of active learning.",
            "A so basically it will interact with the user to try and find more examples to complete the coverage of the concept.",
