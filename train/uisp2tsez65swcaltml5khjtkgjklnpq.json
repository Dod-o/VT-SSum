            "Let me do like that if there is a strike.",
            "If there is the over voltage in electrical system, varistor might absorb high energy and protect the equipment or the system against harmful damage.",
            "That's why Veristor is treated like really economical solution, so it's better to prevent then to cure.",

            "After one year working on the Institute, I decided to move to the production to the industrial Company.",
            "To make to make the switch to make the transfer of the basic laboratory achievements to the production.",
            "For me, it presented a huge challenge.",

            "And actually I was given quite a portion of confidence and we started in early 80s.",
            "We started the production and we were we were the pioneer among The Pioneers producing this component and only after the production six let me say successfully technological parameters had been established.",
            "I was faced the big problem that.",
            "It is not enough to know just how to make it in the lab scale in the pilot and production scale, but the huge challenge is how to transfer your knowledge outside outside of the factory.",
            "How to promote it, how to promote the product and sell the product.",
            "And I was also the one at that time who was obliged even to sell this veristor component.",

            "Well, maybe I could also just calling because my one of the questions was supposed to be, which already gave the answer and you said before I was working with the crowd with Business Innovation center of racial with number of scientists who are always going around and we are kind of talking about what we can deliver to for others or the industry.",
            "I can say that maybe my opinion was that industry is not that much looking what they can attract from the scientific institutes that it's a question of supply and demand from each side.",
            "What you said is that you really coming from these industry.",
            "You were looking around what you can achieve or get from other messages.",
            "So you understand function and went to an Institute so long.",
            "This is really nice example how industry is looking is evil for your cooperation with the scientists.",

            "I can't.",
            "I cannot share that opinion, but in general our industry Croatia is looking and asking what we can get from the Center for instance.",
            "Thanks.",
