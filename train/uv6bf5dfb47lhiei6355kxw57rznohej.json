            "This other kid well tries to.",
            "Get contact into machine learning community and also did you get in there properly.",
            "So thank you from the other side.",
            "So we have several research areas which all build we could play time in one of the other way.",

            "And go back to the history is the one which I know from 80s and further answer with $0.90 or one, what fields in way changed a little bit names along and people were coming and leaving the field up in much the scientific problems and significant regions remained.",
            "And so now at this particular stage of our area would be Caldwell machine learning data mining.",
            "While this other area would be called semantics or semantic technologies, part of it would be a good part of it is also semantic web, although names already appear.",
            "On the horizon that this, I guess would be also part of this talk, but still if you look at the community itself or people which of the current are also people which kind of grew up in the 80s in this.",
