            "At least for your first slide and you can see here I chose the idea of planning a rocket and this morning I was up on the local Castle and I realize that the rocket is not really a very good metaphor because planning this kind of thing just looks like an engineering problem and we're looking at policy is not at all an engineering problem.",

            "Another important thing for policy and very typical for the way we're approaching this whole issue of digitalization.",

            "Recognized by those colleges so those three pieces together will give open education in my view, and that means that if we're thinking of any of the O ER initiatives we're working on, it's nice to try and think of how they fit within this larger context."

            "Another thing we should think, and this is already when we start to think of more strategically about what we want to achieve through our we are.",

            "The Samr model, which was originally developed for looking at educational technology and how it's being set in the educational space.",
            "But it's really quite interesting, and this is something we reckon, recommend then for developing any kind of policy or strategy is to try and think well what function should now the O ER have within the whole educational context.",
            "So is it there largely to substitute something which was there already?",
            "So in a very simplistic way we might say that a lot of the open education or the open textbook initiatives have been focusing very much on this issue because they've been very much focused on.",
            "The issue of affordability?",
            "So they've taken one very specific and very important problem of affordability and said OK, well if we use a different way of providing these textbooks, we can solve the affordability problem.",
            "So in a way what they're doing is it replacing a similar learning material with some of the same functionalities?",
            "That doesn't mean that has to be the end of the process, and I'm not saying that those people who are doing those initiatives.",
            "Only a focus on that, but that would be a possibility.",
            "And on the other hand, if you're thinking of an O ER initiative which is really set within this open educational context, then most probably you're really thinking much more about something that really should kind of redefine, or at least significantly modify the learning setting.",
            "And the interesting point is, of course, with any of these things, you have to think what are the consequences then?",
            "So we often have a problem and that's why it's important to think of these things very strategically and with the policy focus we have to often have a problem that we think the system is just waiting for this new reform, and once we start this new reform, everything will change.",
            "But of course the system has a daily life as a daily routine.",

            "There's been a huge focus on how can we get, oh, we are into the mainstream, and that's the point that once you want to make this transfer to really start reforming education, then you have to think about, well, what are the pieces I need to actually change to make that happen."

            "And that's when we get to.",

            "I think in general both policy and a strategy is trying to do the same thing.",
            "It's just that you might say a policy is more likely to be taken by a government where they have less control of the whole system, where they're much more about setting incentives.",
            "Much more kind of indirect ways of influencing the system, whereas a strategy most probably is going to be more of an institutional thing where you can say, OK, these in this five years.",
            "This is what we're really going to be achieving.",
            "Both of them, however, they set the direction they focus efforts, they define the organization and they provide consistency, and that's what one has to try and achieve.",
            "Then with this kind of policy or strategy, when we're thinking of it, and.",
            "Really, what I'm saying here is of course.",
            "In my mind and some other things I'm presenting here, are really thinking of a national system, but most of this could be applied to any of the initiatives that you're doing as well, which is how can we make it sustainable and fit into the system better, and the way to do that is to think of it in a much larger context.",
            "So this is the thing we have to think about.",
            "OK, if we're doing something cool, how can we take it to scale, and how can we integrate it into the normal system?",

            "So we've developed a kind of a map of the elements we think are necessary for developing this kind of policy approach to looking at, oh, we are.",

            "This is a little bit to do with the fact that we have had experiences where people think they're talking about, oh, we are, but they are often talking about Open Access.",

            "Should it be for an institution or should it be for a whole system?",
