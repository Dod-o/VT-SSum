            "Actually in taking attack structure like.",
            "Like Delicious, used to be and they create a class hierarchy.",
            "Plus plus, yeah, so it's most problem is that relation extraction is a is difficult yeah, so they are able to create the recreate the class hierarchy to a large extent, but when it comes to defining domain specific relations team concepts, most of them at least back then weren't weren't very successful.",
            "But then the idea was OK instead of just us sitting down and building our ontology, reinventing the wheel.",
