            "So that's the plan.",
            "So let me let me sort of start at the beginning, right?",
            "So if I want to tell you how to do this, the first thing is I need good data.",
            "So because everything is online right today, in principle we can collect nearly all online social media content, right?",
            "And what we've been doing since August 2008 is collecting sort of this data at a rate of around 50 gigabytes a day, right?",
            "So we are getting, I think, are just checking this morning, around 40 million articles were crawled yesterday, right?",

            "Everything that Google News is getting or everything with Google News has, which is about 20,000 mainstream media sources.",
            "And then we have also crawling millions of blogs and millions of forums, right?",
            "So if you're getting lots of text for every day since August 2008, right?",
            "Then?",
            "If you would want to do something cool with this kind of big data, right?",
            "So sort of this is like I think now it's around 10 terabytes compressed.",
            "So it's something right?",
            "So the question is, if I want to analyze this data, what kind of basic units of information?",
            "Could I sort of track so that I can start talking about how information spreads, right?",
            "So basically, what is my first goal for the talk is I want to identify pieces of information that propagate.",

            "How do I operationalize?"

        [
            "And if I want to do this, the question is what would I like right and sort of here.",

            "So the first thing we would like is that these units that we will be tracking really sort of corresponds to some pieces of information, right?",
            "We would like them to be useful.",
            "Another thing that we would like is we would like them to be very at an order of days, right?",
            "So what I mean by that is for example some kind of more global topic models won't be appropriate for this right?",
            "Because sort of there are.",
            "Too bulky, they change too slowly, right?",
            "And the other thing is this little things that I would like to track.",
            "I would they need to be simple because I would like to do this on a TB scale and today I'll show you sort of two approaches how to do this.",
            "So the first thing to do is about tracking cascading hyperlinks.",
            "So basically how articles, links linked to one another and 'cause we know their timestamps, we can infer how information flowed.",
            "I'll show an example on the next slide and the second thing I'll be talking about and sort of this will be the data that then will be using.",
            "Mostly throughout the rest of the talk will be this idea of mini tracking.",
            "So basically somehow identified short almost like genetic signatures of stories that travel intact through the web.",
            "OK, so first idea, what do I mean by cascading links to individual articles, right?",
            "So the idea is the following.",
            "If there is some small block post some obscure technological story, right?",
            "If this if this thing propagates through some kind of underlying network, the idea is that other bloggers let's let that be our example will pick it up right?",
            "So the idea is that then some let's say small technological blog my.",
            "Blue circle here would create a hyperlink to the red node and say hey there is this interesting story.",
            "I found it there right and if this process would continue then maybe some more prominent media sites, maybe some more, some technologically oriented professional blogs like Engadget and Slash that would pick this up.",
            "And again they would cite the source where they found this right.",
            "And then you could imagine if everything goes well.",
            "Then sort of.",
            "This would further percolate to the mainstream media.",
            "Like maybe 2 New York Times in BBC and you know then people would cite the articles they read and so on, right?",
            "So if I?",
            "Collect this data.",
            "I identify hyperlinks.",
            "I have this condition that the source can only sort of side things that happened in the past.",
            "I trace hyperlinks in the reverse direction that they point to.",
            "Then I get this what we will call information cascades, right?",
            "I get this little graphs of how information spread and the first thing I can do is for example I can go and enumerate and count these graphs right so I can sort of do.",
            "Graph counting to some."
        ],
        [
            "Right, and if I look at how do these cascades this little graphs of how information flows look like?",
            "Here are a few pictures, right?",
            "So what I'm showing you here?",
            "I'm sorting, I'm sorting this graphs that I that I enumerated, so the Cascades I showed you an example of this in the previous slide in the decreasing frequency, right in sort of water water.",
            "Interesting observations, right?",
            "So first person, interesting observation is that of course smaller sort of in general things, unless nodes are more frequent than.",
            "Things on more nodes, right?",
            "Sort of small cascades are more frequent than big ones.",
            "OK, that's not a surprise.",
            "What is interesting is that you see these things are very shallow, right?",
            "They sort of have this kind of star structure right?",
            "So So what this means is basically every node in this every node on these graphs is a is a blog post and.",
            "A link on edge or directed Edge here means that opposed at the at the bottom tends to link the post on the top in some sense right?",
            "And another interesting thing that comes from here is that many sort of different structures have different have different frequencies.",
            "For example, this huge star is more, is more frequent than this little sort of triangle or feed forward loop, right?",
            "So there is there is very interesting relationship between the frequency of the graph and its structure, right?",
            "And it's not sort of just big things occur.",
            "Yes then then small things, but it's also about how deep, how deep they propagate and what kind of citation patterns they create.",
            "In some sense, right?",
            "So this is for example, one way out.",
            "You can use hyperlinks to try to track information flow.",
            "This is really good because it gives you an exact way to track the information and you know where through which nodes it spread well the problem.",
            "The problem is that people don't like to use hyperlinks or they don't side there, so."

        [
            "So the next approach will be very different, right?",
            "So the next approach we look at is something that that.",
            "We developed a two years ago and we refer it to mean tracking right?",
            "And the idea is that we basically want to identify textual fragments.",
            "Little, let's say sequences of words, but Trevor relatively unchanged through many news articles right?",
            "And the sort of 1 simple idea how to operationalize this is to say, OK, I will go, and for every document extract stuff that appears in quotation marks, so I get a document and I just go an extract, whatever is in quotation marks, right?",
            "And the first question is OK, do you get enough of this quote?",
            "In documents for this to be interesting at all, and actually turns out that you get, you get about more than one quotes or 1.25 quotes for document in our data.",
            "And what I mean by our data is block posts and mainstream media articles, right?",
            "And what is good about quotes is that actually they are.",
            "They're very nice in some sense.",
            "Genetic signatures, right?",
            "They're better than keywords or named entities because it's really clear who was the person who said who made who said that piece of text.",
            "It's very clear at what occasion, at what time and at what place, right?",
            "So I can really pinpoint what event or what caused or what was the occasion that that statement was was made, right?",
            "So it's easier to reason about it and sort of think about now I get a spike in the number of mentions of Obama and let me figure out what's going on, right?",
            "So that's the idea.",
            "One challenge we extracting quotes is that they change a lot, right?",
            "So sort of they mutate.",
            "So what?",
            "I'm showing you here is a very small sub.",
            "Part of what we call a quote inclusion graph.",
            "So every note here is a quote.",
            "Yes you can.",
            "You can read it, it's from 2008 US presidential election, and the arrows mean approximate inclusion relationships, right?",
            "So you can see that sort of shorter pieces of words are sort of included.",
            "Do some approximation in the longer quotes and this sort of quotes further further mutate and you know there at the bottom of this graph would be the original mother quote, from which all these short pieces have been derived.",
            "And sometimes the tense change.",
            "Changes in people by Miss Mistype them, and so on.",
            "So the first challenge that we have is how do we identify mutational variants of quotes, right?",
            "So how do we cluster these quotes into something that says these are all the mutational variance?"

        [
            "Of one quote.",
            "OK, so our goal is I want to find mutational variance of a quote and here I have a picture that sort of will explain how one can do this do this right?",
            "So every note here is a quote, every letter is a word and the first thing what I will do is I will create quote sort of approximate quote inclusion graph right so I will create a graph where I will take every short quote and create an edge to every longer quote where the short quote is approximately included in the long quote.",
            "So imagine that I'm basically doing.",
            "Substring added distance of 1, so I say I have to be included in my parent and I can mutate a bit.",
            "I can maybe forget a word or have an additional work, or I can swap over right and that would be the case right?",
            "And the other thing I can do, I can put weights on these edges, right?",
            "I can say I'm I think I'm me as a quote, I'm more likely to have descended from that parent than these other possible parent right?",
            "And this will create because I'm only taking short quotes to be included in the longer ones.",
            "This will create more directed acyclic graph, right?",

            "I would basically like to identify clusters or somehow partition this graph.",
            "In particular, objective function that we decided to do is basically I would like to delete the minimal total number at the total total edge weight such that each component has a single scene, right?",
            "So I'll explain what intuition is behind this.",
            "Let me just show you what would be the solution in this case.",
            "Solution in this particular example would be to delete this.",
            "Red edges that would be the my clustering right?",
            "So basically the idea is that I want to somehow have this mutational variants where for every for every node I know who is the Grand Grand parent, right?",
            "So for every component I want to know how we all have descended from this Adam and Eve type type of quote, right?",
            "So that's sort of the intuition.",

            "Now if you go more to the personal level, I think the basic question you are asking is what will be the mode in some sense of information filtering and discovery right?",

            "OK, what kind of filtering could I put on top?",
            "To even like may make the make the feed smaller and I think like yeah Facebook has the same problem with the drink it with Facebook feed ranking right again what to show and what not to show so.",
