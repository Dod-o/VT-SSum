            "And Oh yeah people have studied.",
            "Yeah, like 'cause there is a critical stress when you get this transition to Ringling.",
            "For example, you can just play with your skin, right?",

            "Yeah, like you go from one regime to another, but it's a good point.",
            "Like you know, like you can also get domains like if you have like really big systems.",

            "So in also this effective thickness is slowly changing with time, right?",
            "So you know like they just let it sit there for a few days and they see them spontaneously crashing, right?",
            "So now we have to go back and really test our theory to see like you know whether they're crashing because of thermal fluctuations.",
            "Orby, 'cause there's actually some small tick pressure and so on.",

            "We know the temperature, right?",
            "So now we can just automatically tune the pressure and see where they crush and then we can compare this critical buckling pressure as a function of size and so on to in order to see whether we really get something that looks like this.",
            "So I was just wondering with this.",
            "So this dimensionless quantity on the X axis for any physically relevant shape or body, right?",
            "There's a set of a range of parameters where yeah.",
            "So for this polymersomes, I think we're somewhere in here somewhere in here, right?",
            "So you know, thermal fluctuations are just beginning to become important, but there are not enough that you would just crush them.",
            "And also we played with viral capsids and bacterias an like and also like nuclear envelopes in cells, and so you know, like some of them are indeed like in this range, but often in real life there under internal asthmatic pressure because they contain a lot of molecules and stuff.",
            "So you know like that's why they have large internal pressure, so they are way below away from the line so.",
            "They're not going to crush on this in artificial shells, which can be made arbitrarily large, they don't.",
            "They turn out to be too stiff for oh, so this so this polymer some you know.",
            "Like I said, like we estimate that the size that we can achieve is roughly comperable to this critical size, so that's why you know we try to focus on this one to see if we can really see this or not.",
