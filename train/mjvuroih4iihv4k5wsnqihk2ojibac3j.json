            "Is the earth and aren't these two things contradictory?",

            "So think of it as a separate headlight that's on your car.",
            "So instead of avoiding illumination of objects, it actually sends more light to objects on the road.",
            "So the idea is that if you're driving down the road and it's dark, you kind of get tunnel vision and you kind of ignore stuff in the periphery.",
            "So our system could actually look in the periphery and tell you that, hey, there's a deer about to cross the road.",
            "In the middle here.",
            "Very interesting work, thanks.",
            "I had a question about the Lane contrast enhancement.",

            "So currently this was proof of concept so it worked work the best on flat roads.",
            "How rugged is the system?",
            "It seems that for some of the applications that precise collaboration between the camera and the projector is important.",
            "Can this calibration withstand driving over bumpy roads?",
            "So far it's survived through all of our testing.",
            "I've driven the truck probably about 50 mph, and Pitts Burg is notorious for speed bumps.",
            "But you're right, calibration is a huge issue.",
            "It probably takes about 5 minutes to calibrate the system, and about 10 seconds to knock it out of calibration, but so far with our mounting system it survived most of the rigorous tests that we put it through.",
            "Two small questions.",
            "Will you be needing one such system or two such systems per car?",
            "That's a good question.",
            "So typically cars have two headlights, so we're trying to build 2 headlights with this design, and once you have two headlights it opens the door for all types of research questions so we could do depth estimation and stereoscopic reconstruction for example.",
            "So currently we're working on building 2 separate systems, and the other question is if the oncoming car is also equipped with such a system and you detect them by their headlight.",
            "And what would happen, right?",
            "So you saw in the video that the once the anti glare feature is enabled, you're not glared.",
            "But you can still see the light.",
            "So there is some light that reaches the camera.",
            "So we think we have to test this.",
            "Still that it's still possible to detect these vehicles even if they have the system.",
            "One last question, maybe.",
            "Down here at the front.",
            "As you modulate the illumination, for instance, if you stop showing Lane visibility on the left, then you might have to work extra hard to find the deer and the bicyclist that you dis illuminated.",
            "So it seems like there could be possibilities for like a feedback or a flickering.",
            "So is there anything in there to try to handle that?",
            "Yeah, currently all of the results I've showed were independently performed, so in future work we will have to develop algorithms or architectures that allow us to.",
            "Perform these different tasks in parallel, but like you said, there are cases where the system kind of picks up things that it shouldn't, so there's false cases that cause flickering, so you may have seen in some of the videos that it detects, like the retro reflection off of signs off of traffic signs, and it causes a little bit of a flickering effect, but it's so fast that you actually can't really see it with your eye.",
