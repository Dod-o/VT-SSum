            "But nevertheless, as we are physically all here, allow me first to start with some traditional way of teaching because I do like to use the boards very much and I was trying to release as carefully as possible since morning until now and I have at least a short list of keywords which are associated to what I will be.",
            "Talking about now and I would like to put them on board first before I start with my presentation.",
            "So as you can see, infrastructure has been mentioned several times today and to my surprise I might say so.",
            "But then I'm pleased that I have chosen this topic so infrastructure is the first one.",
            "Now the first question, can you read my handwriting or not really I will try to make the best so something that was mentioned in the first talk from Canada.",
            "I think in this was.",
            "I seem to have heard something about chemistry.",

            "But as I'm from Slovenia, of course I'm also linked to the same things here, here in Slovenia, but as you know Europe is pretty small, so it's rather easy to fly backwards and forwards from Ljubljana to Brussels or to some other places.",

            "Because education in Europe is very different.",

            "Collected on one spot.",
            "So that was that was my idea for the first module, saying, well, I want to study in Europe, where do I find all the information?",
            "Because actually all the information is available online, it is just that you have to know where to search for it and where to find reliable pieces of information.",
            "That's one thing and then module 2 and module 3 which are not yet there but will be coming in the coming month.",
            "This is content wise.",

            "So there is a huge need of something and we did set up.",
            "Well, in some small subfield a couple of things, but with the open educational resources this is of course getting much much better and we can spread the knowledge much faster in a more efficient way.",
            "So that was motivation.",
            "To some extent it is solving frustrations also of people working in this in this area.",

            "So the first one is mostly for students and then just recently I added within Paranthesis and their parents.",

            "She just decided by herself whatever she wants to study, so perhaps that's not always relevant, but sometimes it is helpful if also parents have a little bit wider knowledge when their children are decided or teenagers or desire deciding where to study.",
            "Quality infrastructure, as I mentioned, that's my Korea area of expertise, but this module is supposed to be done for citizens, so so it will be done in a way.",

            "So that's a sentence from one of my editorials which are published two or three years ago.",
            "So it's indeed when you talk about infrastructure, soft infrastructures, infrastructures usually are built in a hierarchical way.",
            "So you do have a lot of these pyramids or whatever you want to talk.",
            "You have to know about each pyramid, how to move inside.",
            "You also have to know how to move between the pyramids.",
            "And then, well, now with the social networks, you do have some horizontal layers here and there, but because of this it is even more important that you have knowledge, because now you must be in the position to distinguish what from these social networks is true and what is fake news or it is from the expert point of view, not not correct.",
            "So this is how the module looks like.",
            "It starts with introduction and before I jump, perhaps I should explain this already here.",
            "Is that.",

            "Of course, this applies to me and some others may prefer perhaps some other courses, but one of them comments which I also got.",
            "I think during the first Skype we had and thank you meet you very much for this was because.",
            "Well, it was also mentioned that.",
            "Your course should have some videos as well, and I thought all you know one of those who do not want to be tagged.",

            "You know you should have introductory video.",
            "So now I do have introductory video, but I think it is a very nice example of a video where you can clearly see that people that person doesn't didn't want to have this.",
            "So I hope that the next one is going to be better, but media warned me about this at the very beginning.",
            "He said clearly you will see when you take yourself for the first time.",
            "You would find this absolutely terrible, and that is exactly the case.",
            "So all the rest is much better than the introductory video if you ask me.",
            "So we have this small chapters which talk about overview of higher education in Europe and when you click here you have mostly links to official websites of the European Commission or of other institutions where you have the official information about this, about which under which criteria and conditions you can study and so on.",
            "Then recognition of professional qualifications this is.",
            "Anything but automatic.",

            "Is there a professional organization in my field which I can join?",
            "So the main reason or one of the reasons why I think this is important and very few young people know about this is because.",
