            "Now they want me to wear a second Mike to be loud enough for you, but this room is actually smaller than my lecture Hall and there are less of you than I had students last semester, so I think that I can be loud enough for the room if I'm not let me know and I will suit up with a second microphone, but are we OK so far?",
            "Like back row?",
            "You can hear me.",
            "OK, yes OK.",
            "I'm getting thumbs up so you're not in trouble.",
            "OK. Alright, so this morning I want to tell you a little bit about chip firing and how it intersects or interest the algebraic combinatorics community we will see actually many papers that have been in FIPS acts, so this should not be brand new to most of you, but give you something of a taste for the field.",
            "OK, in one talk of course I can only show you some things, so hopefully this gets you interested.",
            "It is a very fun field as I was saying to some people already this morning and full of good pictures.",
            "Alright, so let's see.",

            "So let's suppose we have a graph as seen appear at three by three grid graph and I'm going to have an integer assignment to each of the vertices of the graph an I want to think of these integers as numbers of chips.",
            "So when I say chips think poker chips.",
            "OK, so so I have a stack of chips at each vertex and the number is telling me how many.",
            "So I have one chip on the upper left corner and two and four in the center and then ship firing is really a discrete dynamical system with one rule.",
            "OK, so there's one dynamic that we want to think about, and that's if you have at least as many chips as you have neighbors.",
            "Then you should send a chip to each of your neighbors.",
            "OK, so this is the one rule if I have.",
            "For neighbors, Ann.",
            "For chips, then I should send one to each neighbor, so that's what you see there on the in the second graph, and I'm showing you firing people ask why is the chip firing?",
            "I didn't name it, so I have not actually gotten a good answer out of people so, but I like to think to Delhi wings so the chips fire to their neighbors.",
            "OK, but they have to do it equally after the first site fires.",
            "Then we get a new configuration and then we see in the top middle.",
            "There's a vertex with three neighbors and three chips, and so that one fires and then coming down the corner has two chips and two neighbors, so that one fires an off to the left and then eventually we get down here and no one has enough chips to fire, and so the process stops.",
            "OK.",

            "So if I add up my integer assignment, then basically if I have enough chips, the things never going to stop OK, right?",
            "So if I put a million chips at each site, then OK, there's always going to be somebody who wants to fire.",

            "There's a notion what's called Confluence.",
            "OK, or local confluence, sometimes called the diamond lemma because of the picture that you see there, and the idea is the following.",

            "Then can I, in a single step, get back to a common configuration?",

            "In fact, if I fire vertex X and then I fire vertex, why, well?",
            "Then I can just swap the order and fire vertex Y and then fire fire vertex X and I will get to the same place.",

            "So it takes a very long time to ship fire.",
            "OK, so in that tiny little example, here are all the possible paths and no matter what you do or what choices you make, you will come down to this final configuration at the bottom.",
