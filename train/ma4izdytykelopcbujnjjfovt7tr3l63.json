            "One is that a lot of the mentors here have students themselves who are in HPC fields and so you like, they're used to the idea that they're mentoring someone who maybe appear or be trying to become appear in the near future.",
            "Another one in general is that, just like we've asked you, we've asked the mentors also to respect confidentiality, and I know it's it's it could be difficult to be like, well, how do I know you're not going to hold this against me in five years, right?",
            "But I think that.",

            "And most of the people here won't be reviewing allocation requests.",
            "You may find them in some other context, but there's usually stuff that centers review the application.",
            "Also, they don't have very good memories, so probably in five years they won't remember anything and it's OK, it's OK. Alright, any other questions?",

            "One thing that I want to say that's related to what Scott just said is that every year participants say that the best thing about this summer school was not only the skills that they gained in high performance computing, but the people that they met, and about 60% of the people who are in the summer School Report that they stay connected.",

            "With the classic track or the accelerated track, whichever one you choose, you will not be judged independently on that quiz, so we're not going to give you a grade you won't even know what you scored unless you really want to know what you scored, you can send me an email, but it's more to help us refine the selection process.",
            "The selection criteria for this summer school.",
            "To make sure that we're getting just, you know, the best quality students and also students that can can benefit the most from this event.",
            "So if you could help us with that, that would be wonderful and again.",
            "Are there?",
            "When they get the results of the test, but we won't give them the results individually, they won't know what each student scores, will give them the results in general, so that it will help their instruc.",
            "Yeah, and you know if you find the quiz to be really easy or really hard, don't let that truly affect which track you choose.",
            "Again, this is a research activity, so I wouldn't necessarily judge your participation in which activities based off of that OK, are there any quest?",
            "We're also going to be doing focus groups during the week, so I will be emailing a few of the students to participate in that.",
