            "And then the last thing, of course, is that since she only wore a brace on one side of, she would have to wear different size shoes on each foot to account for to accommodate a brace, and so that was not easy to have to buy different size shoes for each foot."

            "OK.",
            "There is no sound to it and I'm not an expert so I can't really explain what's going on, but I guess they were sending down the mode which is really heavy.",

            "Can we make a solution that could apply to lots of different people and so this solution is decoded, the modular brace and what happens is that you can wear a normal shoe festival any an issue with laces and then you would put this piece on top by lacing it with the shoelaces.",
            "So this this yellow piece here is laced tissue and what you see these white strips is actually Velcro.",

            "And due to the balancing of forces that actually allows it to act just like a brace.",
            "Also, they had this concept of of putting a non functional but a matching piece on the other other shoe to create this concept of relieved symmetry and that would create something that looked like it was a cohesive design rather than just an extra thing that you have to wear on your leg.",
            "OK."
        ],
        [
            "Oh, so the big design feature in this one was that it attached outside of the shoes so that Tonya would be able to wear an issue she wanted and they were inspired by things like this.",
            "You can see this.",
            "This device that attaches it outside of the issue here is another one where it attaches to the lease.",
            "Again.",
            "Needs to existing products and then there are other products like Gators or designs like that where it would kind of.",
            "Also it looked like something that they had made."
        ],
        [
            "So when if I sketched up the design.",
            "They this was the first step in the process where they had a brace and it looks like Tonya's brace actually, but cutoff at this corner.",
            "Then it would attach to the shoe using the piece that would wrap around and then that would be the final look."
        ],
        [
            "So they worked really hard on this day, started out with a piece of leather and then they put it around ankle and I think here is where Sonia was very very instrumental in making the pattern for this piece that went around the ankle so they drew on it.",
            "They pinned it.",
            "Then Sonia sold it together and this is the brace where they also had to cut into it to form to form this piece over here.",
            "Yeah, so then they attached it together and that's what you see over there is the yellow the yellow piece.",
            "So our solution to.",
            "And then there finally."
        ],
        [
            "Solution they finished it about 2 hours ago.",
            "Is it 2 hours ago?",
            "Yeah, so we don't have a photo for it here, but we can look at it over there.",
            "I don't know if you want to hold it up or Levi or something like that.",
            "But this concept was interesting in that it integrates a shoe in a brace.",
            "So one of the things that Tonya was asking for was a flat that she could wear ballerina flats that she could wear, and this is where is inspired from.",
            "And he thought about can we incorporate a brace into an existing shoe?",
            "And you could see I think they're planning to make a matching site to this, which is not going to be braced, but it will look exactly the same, and so you can imagine that you know somebody would be wearing both sides and you wouldn't be able to tell that one side is a brace, and you can also imagine that this could be incorporated into a boot or something like that, and really just camouflage the entire design."
        ],
        [
            "So again, this integration of the shoe and brace is really interesting.",
            "There's a potential for universal applications, so you could think about, you know buying a gladiator sandal in a store like that where it had the possibility of attaching a brace to it.",
            "And so you would be able to buy both sides with no problem."
        ],
        [
            "So that was the three different solutions that they made and he was just success metrics.",
            "So you know all of them, I think achieve disability of creating aesthetic net worth, not medicalized, which already was a huge improvement over what Tonya currently has.",
            "There were all of what they could be very, very comfortable for walking.",
            "The custom brace may give greater shoe choice.",
            "Modular brace would definitely great give greater shoe choice and in that you wouldn't have to buy.",
            "You would be able to buy the same size shoes on both feet.",
            "And the integrated shoe base maybe not so much because you know it's attached to tissue itself.",
            "But then.",
            "Again, in terms of functionality, the custom braces very functional.",
            "The modular brace was functional for Maud foot conditions, so because of the way the Velcro attaches issue, you wouldn't be able to use it for two Sevier solutions 'cause it's not strong enough, but you could use it from Mount foot conditions and then the integrated shoe brace definitely has a lot of potential to be completely functional.",
            "So that last name, Tanya."
        ],
        [
            "And so now I will let them open it up to the floor for questions.",
            "And that dumb answer questions.",
            "So the structure the structure in the footbed takes up a lot of space, so actually it really is just an idea.",
            "Because like basically someone with like a tiny foot has to wear this.",
            "If someone does wear it, you know.",
            "Tonya, can you give us opinion on this?",
            "Knew prototypes you can speak in slow in the Lula pooper scooper Abner.",
            "So probably pretty quick to surprise via tourist needs here.",
            "Azalea Daniel Gotcha malkiewicz collection.",
            "I bought that voice Khushiya so the Rivonia is a keeper.",
            "Made us in Crosslake keeper Enthusiast indoor concert date accessories anchor at no craft, nice Kushner.",
            "So Magdalena and Diane Duke have something to add to this experience.",
            "To ask.",
            "We enjoyed very much.",
            "It was really an A great experience to work also with Tonya and because she was so open giving us all her like really providing all her.",
            "She was there, always letting us try over and over again.",
            "Like I know this could be also exhausting I guess.",
            "And yeah, and also getting to know all those different people with all those different knowledges was really great.",
            "Will you will some of this be like real?",
            "Will you go further with it so you.",
            "Do a final that she can use.",
            "I mean for at least will think tomorrow.",
            "Today we're tired and we need some nice dinner.",
            "And then yeah, maybe.",
            "I'd like to so this one is.",
            "Functional yeah, this one is made the proper way and it is actually an improved abrasive on what was before.",
            "They have a larger shoe size.",
            "Or is it like this one is a little more refined, so maybe she can't wear a 38 like she normally wears, but I think she can maybe get a 39 and maybe only one centimeter big or one European shoe size larger.",
            "Yeah, so so this one functions and let's one functions but not not for not for Tonya.",
            "In this project, far biggest challenge was.",
            "How to do function and design as tonic condition?",
            "It really really really fine function.",
            "An find function usually mean pick material strong, and in this case was working with the designer Ann.",
            "Innovator and then you'll need to collaborate to do something good enough in this case.",
            "But if you have more time and kind of budget materials, it can be done all three with different materials.",
            "Lighter battle, so long.",
            "Lifetime can be lasting for, like, for example, three to five years can be done, but need more time, more energy, and now we are working very good as group.",
            "Can be done.",
            "Can you explain about the insurance policy?",
            "'cause I thought that was a very yeah I I did want to add that that that was maybe the most interesting discovery and some people are going to have to hear me talk about it again.",
            "You know, for the third time, because I've been talking about it because it's so fascinating.",
            "Just shows you how.",
            "Technology follows social structures and basically, like you know, this brace is so comfortable because it is one.",
            "It will only last for one year, so it can be that much more refined.",
            "It can be a little slimmer.",
            "It can be more comfortable.",
            "By this, this isn't practical within an insurance timeline, because they'll only pay for a new brace every three years, and that's why Tiny's previous braces are the way they are.",
            "You know they have to last three years, and so you know the you know the.",
            "The materials meet that criteria and you know you could extend that into.",
            "You could extend that kind of idea into the prototype, you know.",
            "Which is to say that ideally, like.",
            "You know a shoe and a brace would be integrated by someone somewhere, but we don't make that kind of space.",
            "I mean this this piece, the pink piece kind of, you know, exacerbates that idea.",
            "You know, makes the gap even wider plays with that idea, but.",
            "They they you know.",
            "Ideally we would be able to allocate this kind of time and energy into these braces to be, you know, very comfortable, very perfect, and we'd be less concerned with how long they last and and we wouldn't, like, you know, have a predetermined structure to fall into.",
            "It would be solely the user would be solely focused on the user.",
