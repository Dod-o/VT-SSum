            "First of all, thank you Rogue left for inviting us here.",
            "It's been an amazing experience to be an as beautiful.",
            "In Boston this year we got a record amount of snow.",
            "We broke all our records in terms of how much snow we got.",
            "We got about 5 feet of snow, so when I got to New Vienna and it was warm.",
            "I was so happy.",
            "You can ask the participants.",
            "I've been taking every opportunity to wear a skirt to everything and not have to wear pants and then the second thing I wanted to say was that, you know, even before I go into the projects and you're going to be seeing this is that the quality of the work that's been done here?",
            "Is really amazing to me when we did our program last year at MIT, the quality was nowhere near this level.",
            "I've just been very, very impressed with the results of this workshop.",
            "So what I'm going to do is to go over to workshop and talk about how we designed it in a methodology and then we can go straight into what all participants did over the last five days.",
            "So maybe some of you are here and maybe some of you are asking why do we care about fashion design and disability?",
            "Why is it a problem?",
            "And in fact there are many issues that come with clothing that we don't really think about.",
            "Most of the time, and so you know one of the first things that happens when somebody acquires a disability is that sometimes clothes can be very difficult to put on or take off.",
            "Or donning and doffing.",
            "Which is what I've written there, and there are two reasons why.",
            "First of all, the range of motion of your joints becomes more limited, so think about the way you put on a T shirt in the morning or the way you put in a blouse and think about the amount that your shoulder joints have to move, or your elbows have to move an in a disability.",
            "If that's restricted and it becomes a lot harder to put on a garment.",
            "The other thing is that fine motor skills or the ability to say.",
            "Pool on a zipper pull or just button.",
            "A button that becomes a lot more difficult if you can't control your fingers so well anymore.",
            "If you have arthritis or if you've had a stroke, something like that.",
            "So putting on and taking off clothing becomes difficult.",
            "And then there's the second issue which is our fit.",
            "So if you think about it for someone who is, say, seated in a wheelchair, your body posture is different from somebody who is standing all the time.",
            "So if you're sitting in a wheelchair all of a sudden shirts become a little bit too short at the back and then a little.",
            "Bit too long in the front, because when you're sitting your legs come up.",
            "And then in addition to that, there are some disabilities where your body proportion changes from the mainstream.",
            "So for example in dwarfism, that might change, or if you had an amputation that might change as well.",
            "So does donning and doffing in this fit?",
            "And then it comes to function where your clothing is supposed to keep you warm and it's supposed to be comfortable.",
            "And for most of us it does that, but when you acquired disability state in paralysis, all of a sudden your body can tell anymore how hot or how cold it is, and so then you overheat or you become cold too easily and so warmth becomes an issue.",
            "Or comfort may become an issue if you are somebody, say with autism and your nerves become too sensitive and when it's too sensitive.",
            "We had one client where when it started to rain, the raindrops would fall on his skin and he described that sensation as feeling like needles, pricking his skin so that kind of hypersensitivity can cause people to become.",
            "Can cause people to become very reactive to textiles like nylon or polyester.",
            "So then this other things as well, like protection and storage of certain parts of your body becomes more vulnerable.",
            "Or you know, how are you going to use a pocket if their zipper pulls that you can open anymore to use the pocket and then finally of course this aesthetics.",
            "So in fact, these three things donning doffing fit and function, they have been addressed.",
            "There are people who have designed clothing to address these needs, but when they do that, they often neglect the fact that there was also aesthetics involved.",
            "And so a lot of this clothing becomes very unsuitable to wear to a lot of special occasions, or even just a regular work.",
            "And so then it highly limits the kind of activities that somebody can participate in in daily life.",
            "Alright, so that's why we're designing clothing for people that is both stylish and functional."

            "And So what we did in this workshop, we actually ride the end of it right now.",
            "And it actually started one whole month ago.",
            "And it's crazy to think that it's gone by so fast.",
            "But the first four weeks were all online.",
            "And then in this last week from Monday to Friday, we've been going at this full time and Juliana.",
            "So the role of the first four weeks was really to understand our users, Katarina, Tanya and Silver and we had Skype interviews of them where we talked to them and interview them and we try to understand what their daily life was like and also what kind of challenges do they face.",
            "And then from that.",
            "We interpret it all of that information and made it into a list of success metrics.",
            "So kind of thinking to ourselves.",
            "OK, so now if you want to design A garment for them, what does it need to have?",
            "What does it need to do?",
            "What does it need to look like?",
            "What kind of activities are they going to be doing when they're wearing this garment?",
            "And then when we came to New Vienna, it was the first time that all the teams got to see each other face to face.",
            "And so this is when we finally got down to making the prototypes.",
            "So we took those success metrics and we build a prototype and then with that prototype we would test it against the success metrics and see how well they performed.",
            "Then we will go back after we know how well they performed and we knew what was good and what was bad and we were refined a prototype and so we did this cycle over and over and over again in the last five days."

        [
            "So those are the stages of the workshop.",
            "But yeah, three particular design principles that I want to point out that we tried to communicate throughout the workshop and the first one, of course, is user centered design where we try to understand our user needs an in particular.",
            "We use this model of thinking that comes from occupational therapy.",
            "So in occupational therapy, the goal of the therapist is to.",
            "Enable somebody with a disability to be able to carry out a daily life activity and so usually when they try to prescribe some sort of technology for their patients, they have to understand a human and what they want to do and the context.",
            "So whether they live, do they have a personal assistant to help them?",
            "And so we use that model to kind of understand brainstorm questions for the user interviews and then to help us to get all the information we needed about the user.",
            "And then the 2nd way that we involve the user in the design process was to bring them in every day this week, and so every single day the teams would make a new prototype or they would change something about their prototype and then they would test it with their users.",
            "And so by doing that over and over again, that's where we got to our final products today."

        [
            "In addition to that, we you know, had multidisciplinary collaboration, so we both had we both invited designers and engineers to be part of this workshop.",
            "We also had authoritie's to be part of this workshop with a lot of clinical experience, and then I wanted to point out also that.",
            "Sonya Tomo Ann.",
            "I think there were multiple Craftsman and seems to assist with in this city.",
            "That really helped us out.",
            "An helped us to create these prototypes and without them we wouldn't have the expertise to do this.",
            "So really it was a combination of, you know the participants design knowledge, engineering knowledge, clinical knowledge and then just a technical expertise of people around that made this happen."
        ],
        [
            "The final thing is that as I described earlier, we have this process of prototyping and testing it and then changing the prototyping and testing it again and doing this cycle over and over again so.",
            "In clothing, in fact, it's pretty difficult to prototype rapidly like in a lot of engineering cases, because with clothing it's so soft and there's so many variables in just a piece of cloth, like how much stress is there on the surface?",
            "Is it smooth?",
            "How rigid is it?",
            "How warm is it?",
            "How breathable is it?",
            "And it's also independent that is very difficult to just change one variable at a time to test the effect of that variable.",
            "So we did our best and This is why I say that I'm so amazed.",
            "And in five days we got to this level of prototypes.",
            "And So what I'm going to do basically is that for each project I'm going to be describing what the problem is.",
            "What would the prototypes that were made, and then how the prototypes performed against the success metrics."
