            "It was not applicable for those because the different subsystems use very different kinds of modeling.",
            "Approaches modeling patterns, so that was not the automatic tools could not recognize these.",
            "So what the second best option was to somehow come up with declarative and maintainable mappings, but those are hard to create.",
            "You see here there is a switch.",

            "You have to.",

            "So here if we want to do really reasoning, which makes sense in all cases, then we have to switch between open and closed world reasoning.",
