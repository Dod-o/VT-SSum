            "And when we look at the click throughs that come through our page, it's about the same, same same order.",
            "So the first one might give you about 60% by the time you get to the third one, you're dropped about 1% of the click through, so it's very dramatic in terms of how the clickthroughs drop.",
            "And also the other way that people think about it is if you give me a list of things I'm always going to trust the 1st result because clearly you think it's important and therefore I'm going to give the most amount of effort would.",

            "Look at it.",
            "The importance is making sure that the building is left aligned.",
            "It's not about being syntactically correct, but it's about making sure that people realize it is relevant to them before they even start reading a result.",
            "So what you do is.",
            "Anybody have any questions?",
            "OK, So what we did is the 2nd experiment we did was let's move the keywords over.",
            "We don't really care about syntactical correctness, we just say Bush- news results, or cute puppy- image results.",
            "So anybody wanna take a guess what the difference and click through was between these two experiments?",
            "30% pretty close.",
            "It's about 40 to 50% right?",
            "And when you're talking about, you know 54 million users.",
            "40 to 50% is a phenomenal amount to click through that you're getting through on there, and so this is just a small design.",
            "And The thing is, it is not forcing you to read because the assumption that most people say you're going to read it.",
            "It's not about reading it, it's about me communicating to you that this result is relevant to you without you having to even look at the result through your peripheral vision.",
            "You can tell whether that result is good for you or not.",
            "And that's what we did.",
            "So then let's go to the other design.",
            "So we said, OK, that's really good.",
            "So we know through typographical research that looking left to right is harder than reading top to bottom, and So what can we do to make our experience simpler?",
            "And they're given that we know from our effort that people come in with a predetermined amount of effort to give on the page.",

            "Anybody want to take a guess what happened?",
            "Sorry I didn't get it.",
            "You expect better click through there.",
            "I expect better click through the links above those lines, but you made me doubt here.",
            "It might be below.",
            "OK, so you're saying you expect better clickthrough on these lines here?",
            "Is that right?",
            "OK, so here's the ringer.",
            "This is stuff that even we did not expect.",
            "Most of the folks in Yahoo did explain, but what we found was you made more money here.",
            "Anybody wanna take a guess on why we would make more money on the other side and this is 10s of millions of dollars.",
            "It's not a trivial amount, so anybody want to guess about we made more money on this design?",
            "Because the increased pace exactly.",
            "So that's one thing, because if you got only a certain amount of effort to give, which is if you wanna break it into numbers or only a certain number of fixations to give on the page, and then you basically clear it out so people know very clearly that you don't have to give your effort here, you freed some of that effort right?",
            "But the other thing too is it's easier for you to read and smaller column widths, right?",

            "And the answer is, it depends.",
            "It depends on the domain and what the user intent is at that time.",
            "So a classic example images image search is multi column search results and the reason it works is and The funny thing is the way people start scanning and image result is they go to the 2nd row, second column first because you can peripherally your we are designed as visual animals to kind of pick up images and so you start focusing on the second column, second image 1st and you pick up mine.",
            "Images of the same time, right?",
            "So that's how you make make it more effective.",
            "But then when you start getting your text, text is not how our brain usually things, and so you have a different challenge there and so to your question.",
            "It depends on the intent and the problem you're trying to solve.",
            "That different multi column.",
            "All these designs kind of workout but at the end of the day you have to define what your problem is before you know you can figure out what the best design for it is.",
            "In your talk, you did not raise the issue of cultural differences, so when you do something in your ass on your abortion issue, is there any difference compared to what you are doing there?",
            "Very interesting, that's my favorite topic actually.",
            "So we did studies in Europe, in France, Korea, China, Vietnam and India and in the US, and it's really interesting in terms of how people engage with it.",
            "And this is something like if somebody is really interested in writing a paper, I'd love to work on this one, but.",
            "Image information density.",
            "Right, and so if you look at the average English word, it's about this big and it conveys a certain amount of information.",
            "But if you look at the average Chinese character, it's a double byte character.",
            "It's about this big and it conveys about five or six times that information right?",
            "And so we did this experiment with image search results where you have a lot of images.",
            "And then what we said was if people are picking up mine images at the same time, can we make the image is smaller and move the images closer to each other so that people can pick up 16 images at the same time?",
            "Make it more efficient?",
            "And so the interesting thing is up to a certain point, yes, they wanted effort reduced, but after that it increased dramatically and the way people would increase between now they have to focus on individual images and the scan at each of the images.",
            "Now, Interestingly enough, when we went to China in the US in the US, the way people would scan the text would be regressive move on right in China they look at one catch.",
            "Is the same problem, it's information density, so depending on how much information you're conveying in the information in your alphabet, that's how people change their behaviors, and so there's.",
            "I've also heard like when I went to Korea, the funny story is the head of the Korean team comes up to me is like yeah, Koreans really cluttered, but I think Korean users are smarter because we can pick up more information.",
            "So we are smarter and they will actually know they just as frustrated.",
            "They have different strategies to look at the page and so.",
            "It's again very different, but we can.",
            "We can take that offline and talk a little bit more about it.",
            "Myself.",
            "So first of all, thank you for this talk.",
            "I think everyone appreciates.",
            "It's really interesting to to see actually how how this methods actually work and how these decisions are made.",
            "Nevertheless, I I wonder.",
            "I mean the type of methodology that you are applying.",
            "If you want to support innovation and and change not just the world but the product in A and launch it in a completely new way changes fundamentally, you might need a disruptive change and this type of approach that you presented typically leads to small improvements which will lead to revenues and tons of both.",
            "But it's not really.",
            "It doesn't really promote innovation.",
            "So from your experience, what is the sweet spot between this kind of gradual changes and an disruptive change that leads to fundamentally new product?",
            "I've heard that many times before, so I would.",
            "I would like to disagree with that because when we launch search assistance there was nothing like that in the market in the general market they were of course research prototypes, but there was nothing like that on the individual market.",
            "And when you do these normal traditional bucket testing with just a B testing, you test out three or four variations and I tell you which one is a better.",
            "But the problem is when you test out individual variations, you're getting the local maximum.",
            "So off these three.",
            "Which one is the best?",
            "But you don't know why you on the highest Hill in the mountain range.",
            "You don't know that, but on this mountain for these three designs, which one is the highest point?",
            "Yes, I can say that right.",
            "And So what we do with these methodologies actually step back and say no.",
            "Maybe that's not the best.",
            "What you need to figure out is how are people thinking about the problem.",
            "So we might have a feature.",
            "So what we normally do is there's a whole other range, so we go into peoples houses and follow them for a day or two.",
            "Or you know we talked to a lot of people to figure out what are their pain points.",
            "So once you have the feature.",
            "Like let's say you have a really disruptive idea, right?",
            "The point is, how do you present it to the people?",
            "Is the person is going to pick it up.",
            "And so I think you have to come back to this point because you have to figure out.",
            "Here's my disruptive idea.",
            "But how am I going to present it so that in such a way that people's mental models don't break, or they're not going to give up within the first 5 seconds of seeing your product, and so that's where we would come in and help on that side.",
            "Does that answer your question?",
            "What?",
            "Potato.",
            "Facebook interface is something we which people spend a lot of time and it has also evolution and so on.",
            "Let's say from your experience, how would you judge all this complexity raising complexity?",
            "Also learnability of people.",
            "This relatively complex interface which.",
            "Well, where people basically spend a lot of time, so can you comment a little bit on this?",
            "Not sure I'm qualified on that.",
            "Haven't really done a lot of research on Facebook.",
            "Yeah, I wouldn't want to make an uneducated guess so.",
            "Yeah, so that was on my couple of slides that I delete it.",
            "But anyways the question was have I seen any differences between how people engage with mobile devices versus laptops?",
            "Yes, absolutely.",
            "There's significant differences in the way that people look at it, so especially if you're looking mobile devices.",
            "The amount of information that they can look at just because it's so much smaller.",
            "It's a lot more effort to read the same over the information, and so you have to figure out much more with the ways of presentation and so one of the things that we launched was something called Yahoo Inquisitor for iPhones.",
            "And what we the first thing that we did was we just took the regular search result page and tried to put it in the iPhone and the thing we realized was it was just way too much information for people to figure it out.",
            "And so the first thing we did then was OK.",
            "So what is the?",
            "Order of things that we need to do.",
            "Do we present the results if we present the results?",
            "How much information do we present?",
            "So we kind of ended up relying a lot more on graphics and a lot less information sent, but at the same time, kind of.",
            "Focusing on query suggestion because when you're on small devices your biggest pain point is typing everything out and so how do I first get you to complete your query became the first goal and then the result was the second goal.",
            "So yeah, there's been like quite a bit of work that we've done on it and there are differences that we do have to take into consideration.",
            "Does that answer your question?",
            "Thank you."
