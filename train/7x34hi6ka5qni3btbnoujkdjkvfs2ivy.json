            "So what we're actually going to have to do is we're going to have to do.",
            "In our product, we're going to have to compute the inner product for the triple, but computing the inner product for the triple is actually computing the inner product for the subject, and then we have to compute it for the predicate and then we have to computer for the object.",

            "I should note that with the with the object here it's a variable, so therefore it's zero, but the result of this sum needs to be 0.",
            "So if we want our key to decrypt the data, it will only decrypt it.",
            "If the sum of this particular function is 0, so in one way you can kind of say it's kind of similar.",

            "So let's take a step back so when it comes to decrypting the data, we have a particular pattern here.",

            "So this was an example where we were looking for looking something up based on the subject.",

            "So here we have a pattern Star 4th past project, example project one and it would actually go straight to these.",

        ],
        [
            "So the second strategy, then we looked at was vertical partitioning.",
            "So with vertical partitioning what we do is we create an index for each of the predicates, and the reason why we do this again, it's well known strategy, but we know that there tends to be very few predicates in comparison to the subjects and the objects, so we have less data to store because we don't actually have to store the predicate because of the fact that it's there anyway, because it's the index.",
            "So again, in this particular example.",
            "You can see we have a pattern star Full Path project example project.",

        [

            "Yes, you get the management of the keys, but it's a little bit slower in terms of the decryption, but remember, we're not we're only decrypting it to get the key, and then we use the symmetric key, so this makes it a little bit faster.",

            "Between the plane and the encrypted indexes there is overhead, but it is minimum Ann and essentially the more triples we need to query, the more we need to decrypt, the longer it's going to take.",
