            "What's the future that we need in order to be successful in the 21st century?",

            "So the mission for me back then was after observing the capitalistic system.",
            "Who invented capitalism?",
            "Thank you, you know and which country is known as the country where capitalism kind of came from.",
            "Yes, it's the Industrial revolution that came around that time and place in which country was then known as the most success successful capitalist country in the world?",
            "Not even the United States of America.",
            "Yes, it's America took hold of capitalism and boom, way, way, way, way further than anyone ever did.",
            "OK, took the thoughts and ideas of capitalism and went way, way way further than England ever thought was.",
            "It should do that.",
            "No one ever said that a capitalistic returned an economic return has to happen in 90 days.",
            "It was never written down, but it was a year.",
            "10 years, 50 years.",
            "But for some reason we're now pushing really hard to generate a return within 90 days now America has gone the furthest on that and America is very, very happy that the rest of the world have decided.",
            "That capitalism is a good idea.",
            "I personally don't know why the rest of the world have done so, because as we go through our discussion here, you're going to see some of the results.",
            "But will capitalism does to society, and we'll have to have a discussion whether that's the right thing or not the right thing.",
            "And in my experience as I watched these things unfold and I was, I grew up in the IKEA business Information Technology business, which was probably one of the fastest moving industries of the last 50 years.",
            "Information technology and telecommunications was basically the businesses that I was in, and then I then was in charge of in Germany over the years.",
            "And interesting enough.",
            "Back then, when I encountered the extreme focus on numbers, the extreme focus on results and profitability in very short cycles, the intensity of the pressure being put on the people side of the business would continuously increase because all that mattered.",
            "The only thing that mattered were the numbers and the results, and everything else was secondary.",
            "And at that point in time, I said it can't be the future, specially of leadership, that all that matters is numbers and all that matters is result.",
            "Where's the human element?",
            "Where are things and values that are important?",
            "All of us and a big piece of that was dignity and respect.",
            "And trust.",
            "And appreciation.",
            "Well, people do every single minute of every single day in the companies at the rat, and in most of the companies always add in.",
            "See any respect, any trust, any dignity.",
            "It was all numbers, it was controlled.",
            "It was performance and it was results and said there's gotta be a better way to do that.",
            "And they asked when we initiated what we we now call a beyond leadership and what I'll do in the in the four slides that we have is trying to talk to you a little bit through.",
            "Our view and my view of what the future is, and the chance that every individual has so everything we talked about today.",
            "You can utilize that in a single team with five people.",
            "It can be a small company with 50 people.",
            "It can be a Department with hundreds of people that can be at large organization with hundreds of thousands of individuals.",
            "The same concept will apply to every single situation and I've been in all those situations in the last 30 years.",
            "In five people running 50 people running thousands of people, being responsible for a little bit of business up to being responsible for billion dollars worth of business.",

            "Know liliana.",
            "OK, in the president of Debauchery, Lubiana, I almost thought he was the president of the country.",
            "Right 'cause the way he walked around he had big cars and at bodyguards.",
            "And you had cooks and you know I had everything.",

            "Which ones were the politicians?",
            "Which ones were the business people and which ones were the mafia?",
            "Back then, you know, I'm sure it's very different today.",
            "After 15 years you completely transform your country and things are very different, right?",
            "But what I also noticed in the younger generation was the search.",
            "For purpose, the search for identity.",

            "So the reality.",
            "And, um, you know this graphic is really, really interesting, because this reality is almost the same with different nuances.",
            "This reality that shows almost the same.",

            "It's always a human interaction element.",
            "So why don't we behave that way?",
            "Because someone's telling us not to.",
            "Because some people at the top in control of the system don't want you to be friends with one another because friendship builds power amongst the people that are bound to one another and it's if 10 people are bound to each other strongly and someone from the top says something that that makes no sense.",
            "That's stupid to do.",
            "That actually means you have to mistreat someone else with that team of 10.",
            "Do it.",
            "Or would they say no, they would say no.",
            "They would say no way we're going to do that.",
