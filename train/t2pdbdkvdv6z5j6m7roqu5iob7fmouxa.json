            "Like if you have a temporal relation in your ontology, don't want to expose it to a customer, that kind of can't get it 'cause they're not abstract models, so you can collapse little down through shape or sort of shape definitions that fantastic, so yeah, but there is a real need for better, more comprehensive simplified business ontologies.",
            "Yeah, and we are also aligning them to an upper ontology with the idea that there will be interoperable as well, so I think that's also maybe a controversial But an interesting development, and I think that the reason we chose just because I did a survival upper ontologies and and.",
