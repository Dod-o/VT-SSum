            "So we drive basically for eight years to have computers to work according to European Union legislation instead of the other way around.",
            "Because they didn't actually have any face, but anything will come to fruition.",

            "And so I think yeah, first, so far the concepts have to be worked on.",
            "But also I think the idea is to be distributed.",
