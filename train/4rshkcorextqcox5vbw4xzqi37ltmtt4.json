            "If you want to call it that which actually picked up on this idea of a formalized statistical skill measuring system was developed for chest by GEICO, DARPA, the Halo in 1960 and he needed to come up with a way of estimating the skills of chess players.",

            "Some of these two.",
            "Skills that the players bring in now that is in many ways a dodgy assumption, but it works quite well in practice and it makes the inference tractable.",
            "You could probably think of games where one player can be very decisive in if you have the best player in the world, then that would truly decide the game and not the sum, but you could equally think of games where if you have a really bad guy in the team, you lose.",
            "For example, if you do this team running stuff where you pass on the stick.",
            "Then surely, if you had a very slow there in your scene then that will dominate the outcome in there.",
            "So they taking the sum is a bit of a compromise here, but turns out to work quite well in practice.",

            "So once we know the ordering and the complexity of those many permutations of the result goes away, we can construct a new graphical model which takes that information into account.",
            "It's quite crucial in the generative process we would have to define a probability distribution over permutations, but in the process where we actually observe the outcome, we can construct a fixed graphical model that overcomes this difficulty.",
