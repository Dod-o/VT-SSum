            "One of the idea there was that look we can use randomization where we intentionally introduce perturbation in input records and then we can still do some, some some some recovery using some expectation minimization principles and will be able to construct good models and there has been sort of subsequently lot of work in this area.",
            "This continues to be very important area and if you think about what I said earlier.",

            "And I think something like that is happening with data mining also.",
            "Also it gives me a chance to talk about some of the work we have been doing, so I'm sort of going to talk about some of these applications.",
            "And through this I'll be also talking about some of the work that we have been doing off late in Microsoft or in Search Labs also, so so one of the things I wanted to mention was, you know, I want to give you a couple of examples of it.",
            "One has to do with what is called related searches.",
            "If you go to live, which is the Microsoft search engine when you search for.",
            "When you when you are searching for a term in addition to the results or 10 blue links, you also see these what are called the related searches on the side.",
            "OK, an interesting question is the following that how these related searches are computed.",
            "I think Google has started to show related searches.",
            "Ask also head related searches and I'm sure other search it.",
            "Search engines also will do something like that.",
            "So if you think about it underneath, technology is pretty straightforward.",
            "The initial few algorithms looked at all the log of queries which have been asked in the past and try to give as related searches those queries which were high frequency queries which contain the query term.",
            "So in this case, if baseball was the query they will go and see in the log water the queries where baseball was appearing as a substring Ann and Major League Baseball is an example of such strength, so it's pretty straightforward.",
            "Go and go into the log, find out.",
            "What are the what are the popular queries show that's suggestion and the idea is the following that if a lot of people are asking these particular query queries, this is how they're refining it.",
            "How you know other users might also want to refine it the same way it turns out that if you do this particular thing then you can show you know some of the queries shown at the top, but you might not be able to show if you type Apple, you might not be able to show Macintosh as a suggestion because that's not a substring which is present.",
            "So the other idea was to then start doing session analysts is where you see how people have gone and reformulated the queries in the past.",
            "So if you see that people have gone and refund, you know they initially asked football and then they reformulated the query to say soccer.",
            "Then that's a good indication that lot of people perhaps want to do this particular reformulation, an offer that as a suggestion.",
            "So this is again the kinds of things that people have done in data mining quite a lot.",
            "So it's an application of the same ideas and and and you can sort of create useful stuff for users.",
            "I think the next thing what is happening here is is this notion of orthogonal related queries.",
            "So not only you want to show queries, you in some sense want to show queries which represent concepts which in some sense are orthogonal, meaning thereby that there's no point trying to give lot of suggestions which lead to the same pages but try to give suggestions.",
            "Which leads to different aspect of this particular query.",
            "So again there's some interesting thing one can do about it.",

            "You know, giving the test 10 best results or 10 most relevant result might not be the best thing to do when you are faced with ambiguous queries.",

            "It's like a portfolio that you have an within the portfolio.",

            "If you if you want to carry this purple analogy with stock portfolio and then the question you are asking is the following, what should I show on a page so that the risk of user abandoning the page is minimized?",
            "OK, so that's how you OK and and that essentially leads to interesting algorithms for diversifying results.",
            "Notice here that one of the key idea has to do with marginal utility that if you got a good result for a particular type of 1 particular interpretation the there's no point in trying to show.",

            "Once you have got a result of of a particular type, which is good already selected for for displaying.",
            "OK, so you might get too into a situation where you might want to show an extremely good good result of a particular type, though it is a dominant eye, but you end up only showing one result because you had a wonderful result and you might end up showing 2 results of something which is not of dominant interpretation and you might not have good results for that because you are essentially trying to minimize the risk of user not finding anything useful and leaving the page and the basic notions are following that.",
            "Once you have helped user do this, this kind of a thing then depending upon the selection the user makes then you can essentially go and then show more results of the of the type that user is perhaps looking for.",
            "So for doing this you know this is all the work we have done, which is going to come in Wisdom Conference next year.",
            "We essentially had to have good query and document classification working.",
