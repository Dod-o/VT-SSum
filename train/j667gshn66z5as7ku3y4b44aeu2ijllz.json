            "So this is what is collaborative work all about.",

            "Then you have to have complementary goals and you have to have compatible goals, individual entities, and working apart.",
            "So those are the major things you need to have to distinguish between collaborative or cooperative and coordinated work.",

            "Actually coordinated work, which means that I'm working with you and there is a project with with partners with activities.",

            "Let's.",

            "It is not.",
            "You are forced to do that because you have a obligation because you signed a contract and so on.",
            "So we are forced to do the corner didn't work.",
            "Now the difference between the coordinated work incorporating forecasts that here we have complementary goals.",

            "You say?",
            "Well, I want to have this part of the infrastructure and because you have the other part of infrastructure do I don't join those things together and build stronger, right?",
            "So that's a cooperative work.",
            "But still this is not the same as collaborative work, which means that we have the joint goals at the end that we say, OK, we both want to have something which is a integrated infrastructure.",
            "Which is which is set up through my elements, your elements and the other elements, and so on and so on.",
