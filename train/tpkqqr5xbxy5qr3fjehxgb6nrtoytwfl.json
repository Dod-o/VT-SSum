            "There's not.",
            "It's not trying to model how the signal looks like, so if you go with this to a concert and you record the concert, most probably on Mac something, but it will not match too long because they'll play.",
            "You know there's some warming there involved, right?",
            "So it's you should put some machine learning there.",
            "You can use.",
            "So what I've done I've I've used this with some GMM old afterwards to model and then you can do some some stuff, but only with at least the information retrieval part where it looks for the exact matches that will work.",

            "Again like Indian market I showed like they change a lot with all those different voices very even though it's just really think This is why I was telling that it's this is trying to find the ticket and coding system is not modeling system so I just yeah but shouldn't you include this?",
            "Because if if given this amount of noise it cannot find that we support no you're so one thing is the noise you can add.",
            "Yes, the additive noise or the compulsory noise that you can modify the signal with you can temper the signal and the other thing what you refer to is the modifications on the different cover songs or the different instances of you saying the same sentence.",

            "Most of it was done like by companding, but these were the transformation.",
