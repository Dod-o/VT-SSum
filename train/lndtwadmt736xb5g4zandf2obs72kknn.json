            "Scalability.",
            "Already already was mentioned in A and an extensive list of things that are related to this, but I wanted to reflect on the fact that at Regina's data, as the kind of data that we are managing in this environment has different and different storage and preservation needs both in time and in space, it is not the same thing to store.",
            "Video, or Dyna storing text in turmoil in terms of space, are doing a data intensive work for a customer that requires the data to be accessible here or in 20 years in the future.",
            "The next potential opportunity or time bomb, depending on how we want to approach it, is the decay of the data.",
            "It can potentially decay.",
            "We are enabling data or use an aggregation.",
            "A lot of the applications that we are doing nowadays depend on data that we use from external sources, and these sources are not under our control.",
            "So if we want to link to these sources and do effective applications that keep safe and stable in the future, we need to keep track and we need to monitor the health of datasets that we are that we are using.",
            "So concepts like data availability, Accessibility, availability and change will become more and more important, and this is also this also depends on the type of data that we are using, can be discreet discrete data like the datasets that we have nowadays in the in the link open data cloud or can be continuous data coming from streams and this different natures has an impact in the treatment of decay.",
            "And finally, the human factor mark already pointed out there is a lack of data.",
            "Save your stuff.",
            "For example, the same McKinsey report mentions that there are 150,000 positions needed and 100 and 1/2 million data saving managers.",
            "So this is a lot of people and something which is especially worrying is that if you talk to companies to corporations, no matter if they are big or small, many of them don't even have a data management plan.",
            "And this means that, well, there's a lot of infrastructure.",
            "There's a lot of potential, but it is not clear how to administer it wisely.",
