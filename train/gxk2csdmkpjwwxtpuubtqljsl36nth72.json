            "And it was doing stuff on back on the CPU and so they were out of sync and as soon as the data came back in the GPU, it overwrote the CPU.",

            "This we exchanged the data then with MPI which means that in this case here we'd also like the data to go back to the GPU after weeks.",
            "Communicate stuff with our neighbors.",
            "We need GPU to get that updated data too.",
            "So in MPI what we're doing is exchanging data on the edges.",

            "It's very costly because what we've done now is we've introduced for every iteration or loop data copies back and forth.",

            "Regions fixing our speedup, yes.",

            "Our original applause probably took a quarter of each one of the plate of our original metal plate.",
            "We put a quarter in each of four GPU's, and then we exchanged data along the edges every iteration.",
            "That's what made this working MPI code that was our starting point, and then we decided we could speed up each one of those nodes by using accelerator commands.",
            "So that's what we did here.",
            "So in that case we could transfer the data movement above the while loop, right?",
            "Nope, Nope.",
            "If you put your joint saying doing the communication before the while loop.",
            "Yeah no.",
            "No because we need to communicate the data every single time step.",

            "We came in and through our accelerator to say for each one of those four chunks do these through these kernel things here.",
            "So we stuck in our kernel pragmas and it did speed things up, But the problem was again that the data it was using and the data that it was sending on the CPU were two different things.",
            "So the data we're computing on the GPU in the data were sending every iteration here.",
            "We're two different things, and this was the old out of sync copy, so we fix it by sticking an update.",
            "We say we all we need to do is make sure that the data is on the host when we need it to be, and again, this is a great fix and works perfectly except for the fact that it slowed the thing completely down because we're back where we started with our open ACC code with moving data back and forth every iteration.",

            "So all we need to update on the GPU is a strip we need to get that stripped the new calculated version for this trip to send as a message, and we need to do to send that proper strip back to the GPU after every message.",

            "But for those of you that do things work, exactly how you would hope they do, I'll be glad to discuss this with any of you in detail, because those of you that are good hybrid challenge and no open MP and would like to take that approach instead of open ACC or maybe with open ACC, it's perfectly doable, so we can go into that."
