            "The introduction tutorial?",

            "There are of course many technical difficulties that arise.",

            "As you might already know, Bangtan boys, EXO, and those are the boy groups, and they are so famous.",

            "So it's a very important aspect of contemporary pop in the context of East Asia, and they are internationally viral as well.",

            "You'd like to examine so the population issue is as big in some cases as the representativeness issue, but these are not new to social Sciences, of course, so it's just.",
            "The online sphere has not solved these ongoing problems in the social Sciences and the humanities.",
            "But there are hybrid approaches that I think are very exciting, so my former colleagues at the Internet Institute have pioneered or not pioneered, but further developed this technique of trace interviewing.",

            "For example, showing them their Facebook comments and asking them about that during the interview itself.",

            "Whether it's public is a different question.",
            "So basically.",
            "It's a structured way to collect data.",
            "And because it also comes with metadata and it's in Twitter in case of Twitter, it's in JavaScript object notation format.",

            "But the key benefit of this approach is it's very versatile because you are writing and implementing the script yourself.",
            "So you have full control over the parameters.",
            "How long you'll collect, what you'll collect, etc.",
            "And the other thing, of course, is that API's are from commercial organizations that don't have the same objective as US academics.",
            "Namely they want to make money, hence limiting the availability of data from the API's themselves.",
            "So they control and that's why you need to access the data through the API, not directly.",
            "You can't just.",
            "I mean you can scrape it directly, but that has legal implications.",
            "So the reason they set up this API in the first place.",
            "Is to be able to control who has access and how much access to give these people.",
            "As I mentioned just now, web scraping is the other way to do it.",
            "So it's very unstructured in that you're just writing a script that will automatically collect certain aspects of a webpage, for example.",
            "But you again have full control over the parameter is what you're collecting, so it's incredibly versatile as well, and I'll go over the best way to do this later on in the presentation.",

            "So yes, as I mentioned, little or no programming experience, of course you know you're sacrificing a bit of control here over what you're collecting.",
            "How much metadata, for example, but for the benefit of saving time, perhaps?",
            "And you are still limited to what the API will give you.",
            "Same as if you're using your own script, because of course the tools are also accessing the platforms through their API's, right?",
            "So there's still the API rate limit issue.",
            "And the benefit though of this is that many of these tools are not just for data collection, there also for visualization and other kinds of analysis like network analysis, semantic analysis, etc etc.",
            "So you can use it for kind of a full suite.",
            "Anne will go over some of these in more detail later today, and many of course are free, although you also have the full spectrum of paid versions.",

            "The first one is for historical data.",

            "Shall we say, if you want to go beyond the most recent seven days, you have to pay Twitter a lot of money or rather nip which is the company that Twitter has now allowed to manage and sell their data.",

            "I would say of euros.",
            "To access a reasonably sized corpus so it's kind of an enterprise only.",
            "Dataset.",
            "And the key here is that this is not the most representative set of tweets, because it's focused more on relevance to your keywords but not completeness.",
            "You will not get the full set of all tweets with a certain keyword, or indeed from a certain username.",
            "So be warned about that.",
            "If you want completeness, the streaming or real time API is the API for you.",
            "This allows you to track up to 400 keywords, 5000 users, or even a locations of the ones that are Geo tweets that are Geo tagged.",
            "In real time.",
            "And the rate limit seems low.",

            "I would say this is plenty.",
            "I mean for the backward, my own data set is about 26 million over tweets over six months, so 5 million a day is, I would say, more than enough for any reasonable analysis, especially coming from a more if you're trying to do something qualitative as well.",
            "An it's a more complete sample of the overall stream of tweets.",
            "Even though Twitter does not exactly reveal how it obtains these tweets, it says that it's a small random sample of all public tweets.",
