            "Yeah, well.",

            "Adaptation of ontologies.",
            "Yeah in this example, but I mean if you look at the space you know then the ontologies are for example radial categories.",

            "Or if you're looking at angular categories and left front right back, so it depends on the domain.",

            "You know, motivation.",
            "That says OK if we try to play this game, and if we're all kind of at a certain level in playing the game, then we reach we increase the challenge for us.",
            "So in one of the experiments we've done, every agent is keeping track of challenges and how far it is in reaching those challenges.",
            "And so if the challenges are too high, it's going to decrease.",
            "It's the challenges that it poses to itself in the game.",
            "If they're too low, is going to increase it, and if you have this kind of thing then you get a coordination of challenges and you see that the population is gradually moving up.",
            "I mean, there's a particular paper that IEEE a live two years ago, which I will send you on this.",
            "OK, my question has to do with the progression of concepts in your agents.",
            "Cognitively, color comes very late to too human babies around the age of two years, plus two years, six months, whereas some of the spatial concepts like proximity come at the age of one or two months.",
            "And So what I'm trying to say is that ultimately, in the ontology that is formed by the agent, these sequencing of concepts have a considerable role and one of the very important things is.",
            "Actions which you have appointed to a little bit in the robot models actions also encode what arguments they take, and they have a lot of role in language.",
            "I was wondering if you were looking at these issues, particularly with respect to actions that model verbs that model the head of sentences and things like that.",
            "I'm not sure I understand your question.",
            "I'm just asking if you are modeling actions and mapping them into verbs in language and also argument structures, that kind of thing.",
            "Yeah, well in the Action Action language games, you know this is a verb oriented.",
            "You could say now the distinction between nouns and verbs or nouns and adjectives or adjectives and adverbs.",
            "And all these things is again something that.",
            "Has to emerge out of the interactions between the agents.",
            "We don't put in any syntactic categories.",
            "Our priority.",
            "You know the question is.",
            "I mean there are languages which don't make a distinction between adjectives and nouns, for example, or we don't have articles or or prepositions.",
            "And all of this so.",
            "But indeed, in an action game, actual language are kind of verb oriented.",
            "You know way because one asks the other one to do something or one describes to the other one away too, in which a particular situation unfolds, like one robot is standing up or sitting down or something like this.",
            "Do you have any comment on you know how your your techniques and methodology here could be used for explaining how one might go about teaching language?",
            "I mean, in your examples you're obviously providing some feedback and and so on, but in terms of actively and effectively teaching language, yeah, this is a good point indeed.",
            "I think one of the application areas.",
            "May not necessarily be.",
            "I don't know.",
            "In robotics, I mean there are not that many humanoid robots walking around at the moment, but is indeed in teaching and particularly for example, second language teaching.",
            "Because if you can deconstruct the particular way that in one language is dealing with one part of the problem of language, for example, articles.",
            "OK, now this is what the speaker of that language.",
            "Already has, then you can kind of understand also the target language, the second language to be learned.",
            "And it's not just a matter of learning the words, it's a matter of acquiring the strategy for learning the words N for reusing them in novel situations and for stretching them and all those kind of things.",
            "So yeah, I think this is a very important possible application.",
            "We have a lot 1 last question.",
            "This is an extension of the question on action, so in this sort of historical work of Sirlin, Sterling, Austin, etc.",
            "Use the word language games, but you didn't really talk about language games, so could you speak a little bit about your intentions for you?",
            "No pun intended to look at at agent recognition, discussion of motivations, etc.",
            "Sort of related to this previous question and how you believe your work relates specifically to that tradition.",
            "Yeah, at the moment the redesign, the language game.",
            "And so the agents are giving scripts to play the game.",
            "OK, it's not that they invent new language games on their own, or things like that.",
            "Of course, we can invent a language game or experiment with a language game, where for one type of speech act you know for another kind of speech, act like a command or a description game where they describe to each other and the game is a success.",
            "If the here agrees, that is a description of the scene that sees before them, there are the guessing games where they draw attention to each other in the world so.",
            "No, but all these things like intentions and goals and I mean they are there.",
            "But I would say this is not the target of what we're trying to do, because in the language games are implicitly there like joint attention also or the way that feedback is being given.",
            "All of these things are important, but we at the moment we set it all up that way, and so this is part of the art of this research is to come up with a good game.",
            "On implementable, doable, so that you see the phenomenon arise that we would like to see arise.",
