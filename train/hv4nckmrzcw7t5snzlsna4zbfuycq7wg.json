            "Again, this goes with the fact that there are so many different ways to create comment.",
            "It's not like one way you have this PHP, ASP, SML, java.net.",
            "It is like endless and they have different platforms, different languages, different structures.",
            "Um, where Ms Word files are thing of the role.",

            "Microsoft Windows, I don't think you want Microsoft Funster in Swedish or you know this kind of thing.",
            "So we need only that would be a good start to have A tag that says do not translate.",
            "And then how do you make people actually use that tag?",
            "You know, I'm developer for.",

            "If you go and tell them that you used incorrect terminology in your help file, they will kill you because they say I didn't want to make a help file from the start.",
            "And then when you tell them OK, you should use this kind of tags when you are developing.",
            "How will you make them do it?",
            "You know that's also very tricky.",
            "Um, contextual runtime.",
            "Related information.",
            "In order to get correct terminology.",
            "There seems to be a lot about this automated translation, it's it's wonderful and great, but without having the contextual information, you will just have words you know you will be translating words into words, and they will make no sense in many cases.",
            "They would actually make sense, but it will be their own sense.",
            "So you really need to have the context.",
            "What is this text about?",
            "What contextual areas are we in?",
            "What is relevant terminology for this kind of?",
            "Text.",
            "Without that, you know it's basically then statistics and rely on the guard over trying to.",
            "You know if you have a life or whatever to get there real quick information.",
            "So some kind of standard or some kind of way that we all agree upon in order to have the contextual information along with the text in the file.",
            "And then of course there are many other things turn marching in translation memories, different councils.",
            "Different cattle, they have different ways of doing things, and different is the memory.",
            "The technologies themselves are different, just getting the terms.",
            "If we say that we can get actually the terms from the files and we actually know that you know they're correct.",
            "Tagging and all these.",
            "If you have this information then it's not sure that it will work in one way to get access to the translation memory in a correct way, because they're doing it their own ways as well.",
            "And now we are, you know there is a translation environments again, so these are real challenges for us.",
            "I mean, these are things that our customers come to us on a daily basis and asked for solutions that we cannot provide because there are no universal working solutions.",
            "So what we're doing is trying to at least make something work.",
            "So we have we are doing integrations based on some different tools and technologies based on what is allowed.",
            "But we are not even close to where we should be in my mind.",
            "And this is, I think is the case for most people doing out there integration and doing these tools and then and so.",
            "So I will.",
