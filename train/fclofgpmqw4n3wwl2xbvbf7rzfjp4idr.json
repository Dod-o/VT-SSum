            "Definitely there are many interactions if you go for example for Geo annotations of gene or genes you will see that there are many types of annotations.",

            "Less semantics encoded also in.",
            "Interactions yes exactly, because if you just looking at the links that will bring a lot of noise.",

            "Yes that that why here we are trying to say that in so we are considering the interaction similarity right now in this data set we don't have information about the semantics of interactions, but definitely in the future we have to consider that we have to have some way to relatin.",
