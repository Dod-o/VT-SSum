            "And there is this registry of clinical studies called clinicaltrials.gov.",
            "This is maintained by the US NIH, but it contains.",
            "The trials from basically all around the world, and recently I believe that it's mandatory for clinical studies to be registered on clinicaltrials.gov.",
            "So, so the source of the data was there, but.",
            "What I found painful was that I had to basically go and crawl thousands of XML files.",
            "Back then it was around 60,000.",
            "Now it's around 200,000 files, so the very first step was quite difficult and time consuming to go and crawl this data and find out where the exact information that I'm looking for is.",
            "And and so I did this transformation manually.",
            "It's kind of an ETL process to go through the XML data and and try to understand it and map it to the format that my application needed.",
            "But at the same time I was working on some link data projects and I thought why not.",
            "Now that I've done this, why not putting it on the web as linked data so that others don't have to go through this.",
            "So we did that, but we quickly realized that we need to do more as a result of initial feedback we got from the users that.",
            "For example, where is this entity that I can see in the source but you don't have it there or there is this information that I can find on the XML site or on the HTML website, but you don't have it on your link data side and some similar kind of feedback we got and we realized that and also the other issue was having to keep the resource up-to-date in this kind of application, you cannot.",
            "Really put data that is outdated, even even a few weeks could be too late, so we had to repeat this manual process over and over again so this kind of motivated us to work on automation of this process that that basically the process of building this link data source."

            "Again, there are tools and systems for this step.",

            "There's a big cloud of link data sources, so there are clear scalability issues.",
            "Again, this is a very well studied problem, and at the end you need to publish the results on the web, and we're following Tim Berners Lee's advice and publishing it as linked data and and not just link data in the innocence of putting RDF out there, but it needs to be high quality.",
            "Link data linked to other external sources, and again, even when you have RDF, there are tools that help you publish your data in linked data on the web.",
            "Being able to get HTML and RDF views on the web.",
            "But still these tools require a lot of manual tuning.",
            "You need to be familiar with them and they are not easy to extend, and that's something that we really want to be able to do in such a project so.",
            "If the slides come up, I can show you the framework we have implemented for this.",
            "So we basically have a platform that you can relatively easily extend with your built-in applications and and the nice thing about it is that it doesn't require a lot of resources, so we spend a lot of time engineering the system to be able to run it on a relatively small server for a very long time.",
            "So the live.",
            "Transformation process has been running for over 4 years now on a relatively small server, but we had to deal with some challenges that if you read the paper you will see there are interesting research and technical challenges there in being able to maintain a project that this is scale.",

            "When you have one particular application, it's really not feasible to use generic applications for some of the reasons I already mentioned.",
            "Like for example the system we have built takes in a data repository that that means all the XML files for clinical trials.",
