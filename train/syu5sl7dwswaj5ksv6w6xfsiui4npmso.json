            "And one aspect we see is mobility, so.",
            "That mine more computing will be done in mobile environments so that we get to some extent a little bit rate of our PC's and laptops and rather work on PDAs and have ever seen on our on our PDAs available and also the trend towards more because this computing so that we are more less surrounded by some kind of computing facilities where we are, we are in the end.",
            "Then when I would say well in 15 or 20 years from now, I would say we would have Internet or services.",
            "So what I have written down here is our first example of Internet of Services so that we start to deploy services on the Internet and people really get used to.",
            "Have that available and make usage of that, but I would not claim that that is a worldwide overall trend that we will have achieved within five years.",

            "So what I have here is a mixture of what trends do I see within the error semantic technologies and what will they be good for in the end.",

            "I see that that integration problem is the major area I would say.",

            "And what you also would like to have everything contextualized to either your specific task at hand to specific person that is account using that, so that you have that notion of contextualization around.",
            "What do I see as benefits when we have our semantic based approaches around one aspect?",
            "I would see respect to that on the fly coordination of services and data and so you do not have to program the interaction order.",

            "We have to be able to cross the intent of a user query for example without having to specify explicitly what is the intent of the query.",
            "And then you need some semantics.",
            "For example are in the background and also see that is related to what is what Fabio talking about these multimodal data that are around anyway, stream data multimedia content.",
            "Text content and you will really want to bring that.",
            "Bring that together, like in this case that is our problem was mentioning that we provide some address index media and in these kind of environments in the end.",
            "What are also sees somehow as a trend is up to now.",
            "We talk about how to find the specific service given a specific problem at hand.",
            "But when I think of that Internet of services that service based economy, you could also look at that kind of scenario from a different point of view.",
            "You have as a provider you have a lot of services and then the question is how to find the appropriate customers for the kind of services you'll you are you are offering.",
            "So how to services find a way to the customer so that is maybe a different point of view to look at that problem?",
            "And finally, semantics for the masses that is related to what Michael mentioned with all these social network social communities stuff.",
            "And here I see the advantage when you look into these vast amount of data that are around in these communities who need some kind of mechanism to do some structuring and coordination of all these data around.",
            "And there I see the advantage of again bring in some lightweight semantics into these community based approaches in order to handle the complexity.",
            "And then I would see a transfer indicate on these semantic based approaches also delivered in these consumer to consumer applications where you don't have all these sophisticated people around, but everything has to be.",

            "What kind of application areas are around?",
            "Now we will see you.",
            "Oh perspective and added value by providing a similar technologies.",
            "One trend I see is in the automotive area everything related to driver assistance, car to car communications or that you provide much more support for driving a car on the road and all that kind of stuff.",
            "And I see again a large area where we can deploy semantic technologies.",
            "And also everything related to these sensor nectar networks where you have these large amount of data that pop up and you have to integrate them, interpret them so that really know what's the meaning of the sensor data you're you collect from somewhere in the world.",
            "So for me that are to areas where I can see that semantic technologies are really needed to cope with the challenges there and then we may go into specific domains, I would say.",
            "I in the engineering domain also in the IT industry I see a trend towards that Queen IT discussion.",
            "So how to better use the resources you have to deploy in the thing of all the server farms, that kind of stuff.",
            "There's a lot of potential to.",
            "You seem in a much more efficient way compared to what we are able to do with the currently, so that is 1 aspect I see.",
            "Then related to what I had mentioned on my slide before with respect to these Web 2.0 and community based things.",
            "How to really tailor information delivery to specific communities also with respect to specific kind of people that maybe do not have the training we have around but are.",
            "Not able to any kind of sophisticated technology and also when I think of all the globalization trend, all these cultural differences that are around when you have people from Asia from Africa, from Europe around we should be somehow able to to address that in a in a better way.",
            "There are no underdeveloped country, only developing.",
            "Yeah, OK, yeah, that would be a better term yet.",
            "And what I see at least 4.",
            "Europe and US and this kind of countries is that demographic change that is going on, so we have more and more people that need some kind of support, and I see really when you think of E health applications or all these scenarios that you might call ambient assisted living, large amount of opportunities where semantic technology can provide edit value in these kind of application scenarios.",
            "So that are for me the.",
            "Promising application as well.",
            "I see a good chance of providing some return of investment by using semantic technologies.",
            "OK data.",
            "Also, where in sustainability sounds great, but if you think about the history of our head of unit, but where is really even more concrete, we have some off like summer.",
            "We have one party going on with IBM.",
            "And they have the problem that you have some specification of the user application demands from from their customer and from that they have to derive what kind of server infrastructure they have to deploy in order to meet these demands.",
            "In the end there is currently not a clear understanding around how to derive the infrastructure really install in the end.",
            "In a way that is really are related to the requirements, so most often you have a lot of hardware around that is 90% of the time, not really used in the end because you have some peaks that you have to address based on some service level agreements and maybe when you think of all these trends.",
            "Top cloud computing, that kind of stuff you can handle these peaks in a different way and then you have to install much lesser hardware and related software compared to what you do.",
            "Nowadays, yeah.",
            "Problem, so where is really contribution semantics?",
            "Oh, that you really be able to the design process.",
            "Goal goes along different kind of faces and up to now they do not really understand of how to go from one phase to the next without losing some kind of information that we provide some transformation techniques to really relate these different phases to each other.",
            "So that is one way of approaching that in that context.",
            "OK. Yeah, I'm fine.",
            "We have background.",
            "Use email when I when I think of deploying applications in Europe compared to Asia, you have different kind of users around with different kind of expectations and we need some way of really addressing these kind of topics.",
            "Support censorship.",
            "Yeah.",
            "In Europe, yeah.",
            "Yeah, national.",
            "Language, maybe even colors and SAP for attention.",
            "Yeah, so they they just an entire profession that nationalizes, yeah.",
            "Could I make that?",
