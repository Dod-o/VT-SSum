            "But there is of course some solution on that.",
            "I'm not an expert in on noise or rolling resistance, but just to add to what Peter was saying in terms of from a Rd safety perspective.",
            "One of the reasons why we put back rumble strips.",
            "Is because the quieter the vehicles are as well the the, the easier it is for drivers to go to sleep.",
            "And so we need to be careful for that aspect in terms of the services that we use as well.",
            "But there's the opposite.",
            "The layout of the noise as well.",
            "It can also have the drone that puts put is put to sleep that way, so there's probably an optimum.",
            "There that we make it too quiet.",
            "People will fall asleep as well, but we don't want to have too loud because it's in terms of New Zealand macro texture and we we certainly have a large.",

            "If we if we design in the tires for low rolling resistance or low noise, we actually testing them with 60% of them under pressure.",
            "Because again, we might be actually developing tires where 2/3 of them in practice are actually underinflated.",
            "Because that's one other example of where our laboratory tests to produce our low noise tire, then goes into the real world and I don't know what the figures are like for the rest of Europe, but in the UK survey say that about 30% of tires at any one time, or actually at the correct pressure.",
            "And if the actual defamation of the sidewall of the tires are significant factor in noise or in certainly indeed rolling resistance.",
            "Is that something that needs to be addressed?",
            "Because it's a very important factor even for stability of vehicles.",
            "If you're looking at handling capability.",
            "What we can do about that?",
            "Well, I think about the underinflation of tires this.",
            "Problem can be solved over a long term with the tire pressure monitoring monitoring systems.",
            "This is something we cannot deal now, but I think in the long term, yes.",
            "Yeah, of course.",
            "At.",
            "You have raised an important point.",
            "But we must give what belongs to Caesar and what and give God what belongs to God.",

            "Or let's say warning in order so that it helps you to adjust an stop.",
            "Adjust the pressure.",
            "It's not a self adjusting device.",
            "OK so when will it start to react?",
            "It will start to react minus 40K P. That means.",
            "The tire itself can be.",
            "Minus 40 GPA from the recommended pressure.",
            "So.",
            "The TPMS you must consider it first, that it is a safety issue.",
            "1st.",
            "That means if you have a problem Southern.",
            "Leak.",
            "That means deflation.",
            "Then it will warn you so that.",
            "You can stop and avoid.",
            "The attacks.",
            "But if you consider that it is the real solution for CO2, know the real solution for so it for CO2 reduction is low rolling resistance tires.",
            "That means if you consider that you have 3 1/2% possibility potential for reduction of the fuel consumption for tires in general.",
            "The part that can be attributed to TPMS is .6.",
            "From the 3%.",
            "So OK DPMS DPMS.",
            "Is considered as a safety issue.",
            "It should be able to function so that it can guarantee the safety issue.",
            "The more sensible and the more performant it will be.",
            "Then it can contribute in reducing CO2 emissions, but it's not.",
            "The full solution.",
            "So this will be the last comment.",
            "I wasn't really commenting on the efficiency of detection for TPMS.",
            "'cause you look at a system that involves some sort of integrated pressure and temperature monitoring system, it's going to be a lot more accurate than differential rotation systems.",
            "It was more to say if we want to reduce tire noise and we want to optimize on reduced rolling resistance.",
            "We need to give the road user a benefit in maintaining tire pressure at this moment in time.",
            "People don't know that if they run their tires at low pressure, they'll use 20% more fuel or 10% more fuel.",
            "So stick doesn't work.",
            "Old cars don't have TPMS.",
            "We're not going to read through fit them to 50% of the fleet, but if part of the process is is driver education, they see a benefit in their bank account and we see a benefit in the environment.",
            "So we get less noise and we also get less pollution.",
            "Because they'll use less petrol, so the education is essential part.",
            "Not obviously of this whole design.",
            "Well, 111 thought about this.",
            "I think we should draw this direction.",
            "This discussion back to the two root surface because I think why not optimizing the roads on the rolling resistance if we have.",
            "If we can, perhaps we don't know the problem is we don't know if we have conflict of goals in optimizing the roads and schedule assistance, noise emission, and rolling resistance.",
            "This is something we have to find out.",
            "OK, just just just one quick comment.",
            "I mean in terms of tire inflation, pressure and noise.",
            "I don't think anyone's ever within normal parameters shown any any major influence there.",
            "So I think tire pressure is not an influence for noise.",
            "But I just wanted to just to go back to a certain extent because we are.",
            "If we're talking about policies for the future of European roads.",
            "Then we also have to anticipate what are the policies for the future of Europe styers.",
            "And indeed, the types of tires that will be used in Europe.",
            "I mean one very very specific example.",
            "If we if we forget about the issue of truck tires.",
            "If we think about passenger car tires, if we see passenger car car tires with smaller and smaller sidewalls, which means less and less of the rolling loss deflections on the side walls.",
            "That means for example, the megatexture of the road will become less and less important.",
            "And arguably the macro texture microtexture.",
            "Will become more and more important now.",
            "I think that's a fairly significant thing.",
            "We need to know.",
            "I mean forgetting about trucks, but where we talk about unevenness, which which is an issue?",
            "Without also trying to broaden out the discussion.",
            "You mentioned where and and and, although the fact that Rd services are an issue for wear and Peter reminded me earlier on about all the work that that Dunlop did years ago.",
            "Now I remember a chart from Dunlop which looked at microtexture of Rd surfaces and talking about the optimization of microtexture so that it did not cause too much abrasion and that was a big issue for them.",
            "So to a certain extent I'm perhaps a bit surprised that the tire industry or.",
            "You don't represent the whole of the tire industry, but it's not that the influence of the road surface on tire wear is not considered a major issue when of course it could be, particularly if we see more and more.",
            "For example, high friction surface things in the future.",
            "Yes, in order to answer.",
            "There are priorities.",
            "There was saying is that we have not managed to unify and harmonize the types of payments all over Europe.",
