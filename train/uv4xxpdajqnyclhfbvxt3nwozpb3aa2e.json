            "This algorithm is very simple, it's just try to with the probability of 1 minus epsilon.",

            "I mean epsilon is a parameter, but it's all difficult to find optimal epsilon.",
            "And also, as I mentioned, that online advertising is very dynamic, so old as go back due to the budget burn up and you guys come in.",
            "So we cannot just use a static epsilon.",
            "Absolute needs to be adjusted based on the dynamics of the ad space.",
            "So unrelated or related algorithm to the epsilon greedy is proposed by other researchers is called absolute decreasing.",
            "So this method is very also very simple.",
            "It just try to decrease the epsilon.",
            "As an experiment process.",
            "So the idea is that at the beginning you try to put more effort to under exploration and with more exploration you gradually reduce the budget to exploration and exploration.",
            "But the problem again for this for the epsilon decreasing is that it's not good to monotonically decrease the effort on exploration because our ad spaces can never be be swift sufficiently.",
            "So some new ads emerge.",
            "You need still need to do the exploration.",
            "So as we discussed, so these two methods are not suitable for the online advertising system.",
            "Ideally we want to have exploration.",

            "Otherwise we just we just reduce the weight to this candidate.",
            "So those parameters are the some smoothing parameter and regularization parameter.",

        [
            "So the second approach that we proposed is we try to aim to improve the randomness exploration instead of the randomness exploration we try to focus our exploration to those ads that might lead to the higher revenue in the long run.",
