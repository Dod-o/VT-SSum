            "Well, you don't unless you work for these companies.",

            "So the conjunction of the two, there's more data and there is the elastic processing power needed to process it.",
            "This is a new conjunction history and I think.",

            "OK, in some interesting things to think, Big Data is not only about dumb data and analytics on top of it, it can be also about smart data.",
            "An for example you've all heard about Watson, the IBM program that basically uses fact extracted from Wikipedia for from DP actually.",

            "So this is significantly different from what we had before.",
            "And for the first time in history, I think there is some real intelligence here, and so big data also comes in this context.",

            "OK, but this is not the only definition of big data.",
            "I think the other interesting definition of big data is that.",

            "All these things, computing power and data, they evolve using exponential Lowe's.",
            "And if you have a tiny difference in in parameters for this slows while the difference between the two grow very rapidly and So what is happening now is that we're creating much more data than we have CPU to process it, and so we have to do.",
