            "So and compared to the Emmy speech, there's only 7% Shepherd jump at the beginning of the event, so I think this is quite interesting pattern.",
            "There's two reasons behind that, so first, for the Emmy speech actually President Obama was delayed for almost one hour.",

            "On the other hand, before they reckon debate, there were.",
            "Three similar GOP debate.",
