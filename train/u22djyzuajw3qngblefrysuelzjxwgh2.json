            "I'm going to buy S amount of good one as wanna mental good one is 2 rental good too etc.",

            "Why do we have this expression here?",
            "Well, what this says is that the agent starts with wealth WI.",
            "And then buys a whole bunch of goods.",
            "In fact, I say bye, but they could actually sell those goods or go short, which is equivalent in this setting so that there could be a selling process, but they buy or sell goods with cost C and amount S, so the total amount they spend is S transpose C. And then they get a payoff when those goods come out at the end.",
            "Depending on the outcome.",
            "So if outcome K occurs, they get a payoff of siko.",
            "But they don't know what that outcome is, and so under expected utility, which is exactly what you do in any probabilistic setting, interest marginalization we want to.",
            "Average out over the beliefs regarding each of those outcomes with respect to the potential gain.",
            "So this.",
            "Full expression here, then, is the expected utility for that particular agent.",
            "If they buy S amount of goods at cost C. And that agent then wants to take actions which maximize that expected utility.",
            "So SI star is the optimal action, maximizes that expected utility, and it's dependent on the wealth they have.",
            "And it's also dependent on the costs an now that's what the agent would like to do.",
