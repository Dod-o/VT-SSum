            "And I think this this brings the general question I wanted to mention, which is, we say that a picture is worth 1000 words and very often when we are trying to discuss things with people trying to explain points, particularly when when when the language is not good enough or language ability is not good enough, we resort to diagrams in order to explain what we're trying to say, and one of the features.",
            "That's one of the themes which we could be looking at for the future would be how to integrate.",
            "The use of diagrams and the use of drawing drawings in general into everyday interaction with with machines.",
            "OK, so the question for you would be, have you thought of anything like that for for your particular approach and the question to everybody else is this is this theme of integrating translation and discussion of meaning with diagrams and pictures, something which was.",
            "We could we could look at over the next 10 years.",
            "Yeah, OK, so I used the example to translate menu, it's just.",

            "20 years, maybe 50 years, that we can avoid writing and reading.",
            "So that means we have language technology to enable the oral SoC again, so language now, but they did not get it back to do.",
