            "The reason for these three levels that we're expecting here is we we are a bottom up a program, so we are aware that there in certain disciplines, like for example, humanities, which may be industry cannot participate as a full partner and we want to leave enough scope so that everybody gets this culture into their normal training activities.",
            "But of course we are aware as well that in certain areas of research, in the street should be participating at the highest level, and if industries not seem to participate at the highest level in this.",

            "We knew that this was a necessary.",

            "We're talking initial training is up to the first five years of post graduate experience.",
            "So within this margin we expect that also first post docs could also be recruited, and then we have an you figure which is the visiting scientists.",
            "This in some ways takes on board this idea of the excellence chairs when we want to do with this is to allow this networks to have the possibility of having.",
            "Researchers were high level and who are a very mostly very senior researchers who are going to be able to transfer knowledge at certain levels are going to be training in certain areas that the network would benefit very much off, but they're not really able or capable to have a inside to be able to have this this this extra training.",
