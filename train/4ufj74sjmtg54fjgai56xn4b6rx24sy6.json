            "So web search engine users are notorious for typing really short queries, and they sometimes leave out key information from the queries in the queries end up being ambiguous, and this might happen because of multiple reasons.",
            "The users may not be aware of the, so they may not have the vocabulary for that particular search that they're doing, or they may think that the particular is obvious to them, but they may not know that the query without that particular additional word is ambiguous and the search engine probably knows a lot more than the user, so they probably think it's.",
            "So for example, they may omit reviews when they actually looking for reviews for that particular camera, or they may just type jobs, or, you know, teaching jobs or something without specifying where they actually live, because they probably it's very obvious to them.",
            "So what we want to do is actually try and find cases where people often skip certain types of information when they type queries and then try to satisfy the user need and in terms of so we talk about broad 'cause we want our aspects that we learn or that we figure out.",
            "To cover a huge set of queries and the principle reason for this is that so multiple eye tracking studies have shown that when users scan through search result pages that do it extremely fast, they pay most of the attention to the URLs to the titles of queries.",
            "They pay a lot of attention to the bolded words or the say indentations are search engines do so essentially what they're doing is paying attention to kind of motives of information organization on the search results page, which they have learned from past experience with other sessions that these things are useful.",
            "And with broad queries aspects we want to achieve similar results.",
            "So we want to know if we have certain very broad things which apply to a bunch of queries, then we expect the users at some point in time will get used to these.",
            "They'll know what sort of effect these broad query aspects have on the query, and then it would be a lot easier for them as opposed to query suggestions where each query suggestions tuned specifically for the query and it takes a user a lot more cognitive effort to go over each of the query suggestion and try to figure out what are things about their other ancillary advantages like maintenance costs are low.",

            "I'll first talk about what is our assumption about the user or what assumptions we make about users interaction with the search engine and how we hope to learn from that.",

            "The search engine takes the query, returns general results, the user then realizes that the actor she actually wanted reviews, but has gotten mostly shopping results.",

            "Additional term is often needed or sometimes needed an if the search engine can see the same pattern happen again.",
            "Again in many search sessions the search engine might be able to learn that there is this sort of a query aspect or an aspect to product queries called reviews, which indicates that the the the search user might want to refine the query based on that and the search engine could then instead of returning just general results for a query which is about a product, it might return the general results plus a suggestion for these query aspects.",
            "So say shopping or reviews or repairs or whatever.",
            "It is that discovers, and this saves the user some effort because the user can now directly optimal sort of click or select this particular aspect they interested instead of trying to go through the search results and determine what is it that they wanted, which is not represented in the results, and then adding it to the query or whatever.",
            "So this is the sort of thing that we want to achieve.",
            "We want to learn from the reformulations or the reformulation activity that we observe on Yahoo's search logs and try and come up with these query aspect, which might be useful to the user.",
            "But we have made so this system has a whole bunch of moving parts and we have to make a whole bunch of assumptions to make this even to even learn something out here.",
            "So the so the whole bunch so assumptions that I'm talking about are something like.",
            "OK, even if you learn that reviews review a few other words together, make a really nice aspect.",
            "It's tricky how to display to the user how to suggest it to the user, so we probably need a human in there and we're going to assume that the human does a good job and makes a convincing aspect out of whatever this algorithm discovers.",
            "We're also making assumption about how a user actually looks at the various query aspects that are offered to her and select the one that might lead to the correct result.",
            "And at this point of time we assume that the user sort of nodes.",
            "So another thing, another problem.",
            "Potential problem is how does once the user selects the particular query aspect that she's interested in, how does a search engine modify the search results?",
            "The search engine could add terms to the query and reorganize the results, or it could it could just filter out those search results which don't belong to that aspect.",
            "So there are multiple ways the search engine could respond.",
            "Essentially we make a simplifying assumption out here which says that we succeed in our task or those user is happy if we are able to provide an aspect in response to a query.",
            "Which shares the qualifying words which the user might have in mind, how the process plays out is something that we sort of sweep under the table.",
            "So if you have Android sort of trying to model that so."
        ],
        [
            "This in mind, let's see how we form.",
            "So this is how we formulate the problem like this.",
            "Like I said, we are going to model the query reformulations of the user, so Bigquery, so we represent a query by a set of qualifying qualifier terms, and these are these are weighted an similarly aspects are also a set of qualifier terms up.",
            "Once again, they waited and we want to essentially try to see if we can suggest very close aspects for the qualifying terms that we actually see for the query.",
            "So the system stores N disjoint aspects and.",
            "This end is based on, you know, our limits on user attention or our system requirements and things like that.",
            "Moreover, in response to an original query, we're allowed to show just K aspects or actually at the most gas pects and K again comes from how much space we have on the search results page.",
            "We can't just arbitrarily fill the entire page with search aspects that we think are useful, and so now we have a trade off out here, so we want to cover as many.",
            "Orignal queries as possible.",
            "So we want to be able to show aspects which are very close to as many queries as possible, But this would suggest that you know we come up with one large aspect which covers every query, but we don't want to show externus qualifies in these aspects, so a user may not even find it useful to may not even understand that aspect is useful for her query if it has too many external qualifiers, so extra qualifiers.",
            "So this is sort of the trade off that we want to play with in the in the problem, and so we need to.",
            "Basically we need a single reward function which."

            "Just straight off, which is what I'll discuss now.",

            "So essentially it's a summation over our query load and we have a term which is the query frequency.",
            "So we want to be more accurate on queries which are sort of seen more frequently.",
            "That's straightforward and the next term is essentially the similarity between the representation of the query.",
            "And the representations that we have for the aspects for the K best aspects that we select for this query.",
            "So there's a.",

            "The function that we tried a bunch of things we've looked at Jacquard extended Jacquard F measure and we basically settled on weighted measure the whole bunch of reasons.",
            "And in fact this entire section on our paper dedicated to this.",
            "But the typical reason is that normal left measure does not take into account sort of how frequently certain aspects occur or doesn't don't occur, or how frequently certain qualifiers occur don't occur.",
            "So we have this weighted version which essentially boils down to dot product of these vectors that we're talking about.",
            "But for this network to make sense, we have to normalize this vector so that they have sort of similar values.",
            "Otherwise one would override the other.",
