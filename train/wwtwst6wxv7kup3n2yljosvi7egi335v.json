            "This combination represents a key, and we have two people, each one and it's two.",

            "So of course keys is a source of knowledge, so we can actually declare it in an ontology.",
            "So you can use their his key action that is provided by all two to enrich your ontologies with the keys that you find an.",

            "So what are the limitations of this kind of of this kind of keys?",
            "So there we have face actually cases where no keys have been found in some data sets, so actually we were very frustrated and also keys by default they are generic, which means that given a class, they have to be true for every instance of the class, so we cannot have actually exceptions.",
