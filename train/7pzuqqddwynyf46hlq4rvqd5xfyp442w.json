            "I would like to reply and to comment on maybe just a clarification before we get any further.",
            "In my understanding, Simone did not make a case for a new Eric, he just tried to give us the broad picture as free and the Ericsson so on.",

            "I mean we see more and more countries and Austria was probably the first one, but it's actually has happened where Chlorine and Daria go together and try to do things together.",
            "I'm very.",
            "Well, the fact that this is a highly political question and we do not have any politicians here so I can speak, speak frankly and without much caution in some circles and would be much more very instating these things just like that.",
            "And also we've been doing that from the very beginning.",
            "So chlorine and Aria is now called claria, as it's also the case in the Netherlands, but we were one group from the very beginning and have made very good experiences with that.",
            "Our ministry, I'm quite sure would not be very happy if you split it up or even with respect to any new Eric's that are coming up.",
            "Now thinking about the sustainability of projects such as elexis is something which we have been doing for very long now.",

            "We now as Alexis.",
            "We still have to prove.",
            "That we are worth sustaining and I just want to once again applaud Seaman and for establishing these this kind of observer network because.",

            "Those of us who are funded and work on the project, but that we we actually realized through this participation of external observers.",

            "We have 3 minutes so.",
            "No, we have an hour and a half after lunch.",
            "Remember that it's just for discussion, so if there are, but this panel will not be there after lunch.",

            "Sorry, I may be new to her whole debate about applying.",
            "For all this being including all of these networks and everything, so I might be asking naive questions now.",
            "You mentioned something about being in contact with ministries.",
            "That means that if somebody gets to be in one of the Clarion or Daria networks, you have to be in contact with the Ministry in Romania for instance.",
            "Compared to that that we have to be in the contact but for Romania for Romanian to join either Clarin Daria.",
            "It's not enough for the researchers to say we want to join.",
            "It is your Ministry of research that actually has to make the application because it's countries that join Eric's not individual institution.",
            "Difficult exactly.",
            "It is very, very difficult, very difficult.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thank you, I have actually very closely related question because yeah, I'm from that wider Europe concept.",
            "How supported could be the grassroots initiative?",
            "Because let's say I come back to Kiev, what tomorrow afternoon and make it toward to the Ministry of Education was come on.",
            "Let's join diarrhea and then say why should we say it's cool?",
            "OK, why should we?",
            "Can there be established an interface?",
            "Or maybe it has already been established with, you know, individual initiative being vetted by Daria or Clarin and then brought back to the government government institutions we do?",
            "I mean part of that's what our job is to help you guys establish your national consortia.",
            "So in case of diarrhea you can become a cooperating partner before the country becomes a member.",
            "You have you have something similar.",
            "So one step is for universe your University to get in touch with Clarion or Dorian.",
            "Say we would like to become cooperating partner.",
            "We start talking about that and then the next step is for you to start working on establishing a national National Consortium.",
            "And that's also where you get our help.",
            "I done a lot of work with our colleagues in Bulgaria and the ministry is ready and they will be joining as a new member country this year.",
            "So it's possible I'm just saying it's a lot of hard work, but you will get all the support you need from our.",
            "OK, thank you.",
            "I'm not sure about the diarrhea website on the Clarion website there is even a whole page with documents and references to use for information that can help you to prepare that.",
            "And of course you can always contact us for further support.",
            "Thank you, thank you.",
            "Thank you.",
            "I completely understand what Simone was saying about making this sustainable, and it's a really, really good initiative.",
            "I mean what we see and what we saw these days.",
            "Alexis is really wonderful and if it gets, I don't know.",
            "Maybe 1/2 of these things get realized.",
            "It will be really great, but to me it seems that it Eric is not a good framework for this exactly because it's also expensive for countries and it's very very.",
            "Card and to to discuss with politicians and to depend on their willingness to understand the importance of these things.",
            "We all know what does this mean?",
            "So I see Alexis as being independent of this as being a framework that is independent of policies.",
            "And of course it's probably idealistic, but I don't know just thought.",
            "OK, so let me just it's.",
            "The end of the session already.",
            "So first I would like really to thank you for your participation, but before the next.",
            "Then at the last session, which is basically discussion, so nothing is prepared, so I will just stand there and ask if you have some comments or questions about, but as a food for thought also on this topic that we are discussing Now, let's think about something.",
            "Let's think about concrete, concrete numbers in the sense that when you think about, let's say if you try to guess what kind of funding would be needed for basic basic sustainability of.",
            "Alexis, what will be produced?",
            "So I gave myself this kind of, you know, game job and I would say looking at things it would what would be required is something like 100,150 thousand euros per year.",
            "So if we think about the number of participating observers now, and let's say it's 50 and let's say by the end of the project it will be 100.",
            "So what it comes down to?",
            "Well, it's something in between, let's say 2000 euros, 3000 euros per year.",
            "For big institutions is not that big kind of well investment.",
            "Let's say now if we take the other number that we saw yesterday, so we have actual recorded users from 250.",
            "Well, basically universities but all other institutions do so if we divide with that number, it would come down to something like 400 or even less if we get to the desired number of 500 institutions there.",
            "So it's really like something that you give for the software that you use every day.",
            "So we are.",
            "We are actually talking about that kind of funding.",
            "If the community is interested in sustaining that.",
            "So let me conclude with this.",
            "Thank you again and see you in an hour and a half.",
            "I think at 2:00 o'clock.",
            "An hour, one hour, 1 hour OK one hour not one hour and a half one hour.",
