            "So that we can understand it and the goal is to make pipelines scale.",

            "One example is if you have an identify.",
            "Which goes to signature.",
            "And then finds twenty sources of RDF, which we did in this example that you run.",
            "And then to transform, you can download those 20 RDF files in parallel.",
            "Because, as you may see in this room, the bottleneck in downloading the files is not your local CPU.",
            "It's not your local memory, it's not your local IO, it's the remote side or somebody in between.",
            "So this you can parallelize very quickly and you get a huge speedup as compared to running them sequentially.",
            "Another reason are you can just merge these parallel downloaded files and run the query evaluation.",
            "So this may seem a trivial parallelization, but this is already quite powerful an so in many cases what you need to know is you need to know where the bottleneck is.",
            "I need to figure out if the bottleneck.",
            "If the problems are independent of each other and downloading one file is independent from downloading another file, so you can very easily parallelize it.",
            "That's one way.",
            "Another way is you can distribute it and they go together to some extent.",
            "So if you run you're identifying one machine if this identify.",
            "Plug in is very expensive.",
            "It is not in this case, but we have also very expensive plugins so the one plug-in can easily satisfy your one machine.",

            "You cut the data in some way.",
            "It doesn't matter because the map is anyway independent.",
            "This is the promise you got, so you can cut this.",
            "You give this to different machines.",

            "So this is the first part of the you have solved the first part.",
            "Let's say now you have here lots of key value pairs.",

            "It doesn't know what this reduces getting, but he knows that for him he gets all the data that belongs to the same key.",

            "By giving it the same key?",
            "So you split the data into independent pieces by giving them some keys and the keys identify the partitions basically and then this is split then a very efficiently over the machines and there is a distributed file system that tries to assign the job where the data is instead of shipping the data to the job.",
            "Because these are typically very very large files, so instead of shipping 200 gigabytes.",
            "Yeah, you can just give it to the machine that already has the 200 gigabytes.",

            "Is first of all, you can run plugins in parallel on remote machines.",
            "So you when you run your pipeline, you can register some computing resources.",
            "So for example 6 laptops in the basement.",
            "And then when you have a decider, one of these deciders that we have can ship stuff remotely, and this decider will ask at runtime.",

            "For example, signature OK, this is very cheap.",
            "Away, but still like I said, a signature identifier uses many threads in memory to download and RDF.",
            "And in another way, also signature uses distribution because behind the service signature there are eight machines sitting in Galway answering your queries, so of course.",

            "Pipeline for doing natural language recognition and this is runs also on a supercomputer, but is also inside the plug-in.",

            "Yeah.",
            "Run things remotely, then you have your local decider.",
