            "So, have you given any thought in there beyond user privacy, thought to accuracy?",
            "So if I'm interested in mining the click logs, the first thing I do once I have an idea of what queries to give.",
            "Is look at the queries that I think I'm going to actually care about.",
            "Start up a little cluster of machines, issue those queries and click on URL so that when you release them everybody else gets the wrong version of the click graph.",
            "I minus off my distribution and I get the right one and I only I have all the information to mine and nobody else does.",
            "That's a great question, and that's one of the things that we definitely intend to think about, because right now we're really focused only on the user privacy.",
            "We're not guarding against malicious people who would trying to mess the distribution for everybody else.",
            "So do you think that search engines are actually going to use your system to release data?",
            "Because I can manage and I could get the Social Security number of lawyer and spam it under multiple user IDs to the search engine's queries, and I don't think the lawyer would be very happy even if you showed him your privacy guarantee here.",
            "Right, so if you think back to the privacy definition, the way it defines that it protects user privacy is that if you personally use the search engine then the risk to you doesn't increase from the queries that you pose.",
            "So if there's somebody else that knows your Social Security number already and he wants to attack you, then he doesn't need the data set release, right?",
            "He can just publish it on on any website instead without having to go through the whole process.",
            "So we protecting from you from you not being able to use the search engine because you think that this poses a risk to you, right?",
            "And in terms of to answer the second part of your question, whether the search engines would actually go ahead and release it, well, it's kind of up to them.",
            "But as I said, there is more to user privacy, and that's something that they would have to weigh in when considering such a release.",
            "Thank you.",
            "So I have a couple of questions.",
            "One of them is if you want to keep some of the temporal information.",
            "Is there a way to do that using your framework?",
            "We have had a little bit about that and a natural approach.",
            "There would also be to sort of for perturb the time information in some way, but we don't have a provable, if private, way to do that.",
            "That's definitely something we'd like, but we don't have a way to do that yet.",
            "OK, thanks.",
            "And then the second question is, did you actually try this on the AOL data set to see how much of the data set would actually be kept if you wanted to release the data set using your.",
            "Definition yeah, so we didn't try it on the AOL data set.",
            "We tried it on a data set of another large search engine, an roughly so that to the 2.5 million and 3.5 billion impressions that I showed is from from that attempt.",
            "And roughly speaking, we can get about 30% of the total impressions that would be preserved in the release.",
            "The reason why I was asking was because in that data set, there are actually many unique queries.",
            "So.",
            "Finding ones that are frequent.",
            "This is kind of hard.",
            "There wouldn't be that many, so I was just curious.",
            "So I I had to question, but I think the first you mentioned that what you can do with the long tail, because I mean you're losing 50% the rest of them interesting information.",
            "So my second kind of question and comment is that.",
            "Even that you prove that taking frequent queries works, you may have some person asking the same personal query every day.",
            "So, So what you really want this?",
            "Take frequent queries, but done by different people.",
            "So three different IPS, different cookies, and I think if you use that you could have just one parameter.",
            "One parameter will be the threshold of.",
            "Frequency of queries produce purple or so many users and then you will need this user limit and I think will be even simple right?",
            "So we kind of doing that in the sense that we are limiting each user.",
            "There are certain number of queries, so even if you obsessively ask the same question, only say 20 or whatever of those are going to be considered and the threshold is much higher than that.",
            "But I think your other suggestions also very good in the sense that perhaps you look at fewer number of.",
            "Queries per user and then perhaps your threshold can be lowered as well.",
            "So that's also an approach.",
            "So greater sessions the sequence of credits that are issued one after another gives a lot of interesting information.",
            "And indeed, besides the viewer like frequency statistics, it's one of the most important sources of the data.",
            "In a sense, it's maybe like 50% of the value you can get from the queries is by following these sessions.",
            "So in your approach you drop this information.",
            "Is there some way to preserve it?",
            "So part of it is to baby hope that the sequence information can be inferred from the query click graph, because the same queries that are asked in sequence also lead to clicking on the similar types of URLs.",
            "But the other part is as I mentioned in the answer to unanimous question, is that that's something that we'd like to do.",
            "Would like to preserve the temporal information, but we don't have a way to do that in a provable way yet.",
            "I was also wondering how would you evaluate?",
            "I mean, you gave nice intuition, but can you just take a data?",
            "Imagine you release it as it is anonymized.",
            "Release it your way and then measure about a particular person there the way you were showing us at the beginning.",
            "That's a great question, and the reason why we give intuition rather than quantitative evaluation is that there are very many different ways that the query click graph could be used, and so in order to have quantitative utility evaluation, then you'd have to do the release for the specific purpose, and then you could say, well, if these are the kind of things you'd like to preserve, then we can quantify.",
            "What it would be so, for instance, if you wanted just the numbers, we can quantify what the numbers can be formally, but if you're doing a release for a broad range of applications, that's kind of meaningless to say.",
            "This is the utility unless you have a specific application in mind.",
            "My question was on.",
            "Hi, what is your figure to show me privacy?",
            "How much privacy you preserved because of releasing not AOL way but your way and then change parameters and show me again.",
            "I mean some of the questions you showed showed that earlier there general they are private but I was wondering like if you just measure that.",
            "Yeah we have a more detailed evaluation in the paper depending on what you choose as your epsilon Delta privacy guarantees, how much of the log?",
            "Can you get and what kind of queries you can get?"
