            "We can.",
            "And OK, so there's.",
            "So we're going to play around a little bit doing that so.",
            "First thing we're going to do.",
            "Is.",
            "Use a Gaussian filter on the image to smooth it a little bit and maybe maybe this was a little bit fast, but just do it again.",

            "So I'm just.",
            "But I'm going to take here.",
            "So I'm just going to take the 1st.",
            "So here what I'm doing.",
            "I'm taking the 1st.",
            "So I take everything in the X axis.",
            "Everything in the Y axis and then the first component which would be the red component.",
            "I smooth it with a Gaussian filter and then I hear I compute the binary image which is.",

            "See, but we can look at it.",
            "OK, so this is just an array as it has the different regions are labeled.",
            "The different regions are labeled with different numbers.",

            "Here there was a little bit of a.",

            "So this is.",
