            "OK, so we can add light in in these regions out here, so they will be recorded by the camera, but not really by your eye, at least to any significant degree."

        [
            "OK, So what I'm showing here is those cameras sensitivity functions on this.",

            "And there's another.",
            "There's very little in the visible wavelengths.",

            "OK, and the idea is that this lobe of energy will be recorded by the Blue Channel and then this lobe of energy out here will be many recorded by the Red Channel.",
            "OK, so with a single image using this flash we can actually get both infrared and UV, but just sort of different color planes.",

            "This is being measured with a calibrated spectrometer, and it turns out there are actually sort of government tables that specify the maximum safe exposure that you can put peoples eyes, which is most sensitive part of the body.",
            "And there's a sort of hazard factor here which really tells you how dangerous a particular wavelength of light is and the fortunate thing is that this hazard factor drops off dramatically as you get close to sort of visible wavelengths I mean.",
            "Essentially so you can see what Dan in this part of this wavelength range.",
            "Here, the hazard factor is really fairly low, and you know it's climbing very steeply as you get to sort of shorter wavelength.",
            "So in other words, the fact that very, very close to visible is really what saves us here.",
            "So this isn't just outside the visible range, it's when you think of UV.",
            "You often think very harsh sunlight, but sunlight is down so 300 nanometers down here, whereas we are sort of much.",
            "With longer wavelength than that, and if you run the numbers, it turns out you can have 100,000 flashes from the flash at standing.",
            "You know when you're sending me away from it, or you know if you're outside in a bright, sunny day, it's really equipment being outside for just a tiny fraction of a second, so there's not a significant health hazard here.",
            "Perhaps another way of understanding in a more intuitive sense if you are into a nightclub and they have those dark lights, they sort of funny lights that make people's clothes glow sometimes.",
            "This is the spectrum of those things, and so if you the total dose you get from each flash is equivalent to staring one of those lights for maybe about a second or something like that, and so people don't seem too concerned about the effect they might have on people's eyes.",
            "OK, so that's the safety issue."

        [
            "Now at this point I would pull out the camera having totally was safe and then demonstrate to you how much dimmer the dark flashes compared to a visible flash are the same for the same camera exposure.",
            "Unfortunately don't have the camera with me, so I'm just going to show this plot.",
            "So what we did was to take the dark Flash and a regular camera flash and place a neutral density filters in front of this thing until when we find a test subjects they felt that this was about as bright.",
            "As this was OK and so we paid around little bit and it seems you need about 220, the dark Flash is about 220 times dimmer than the visible flash for the same camera exposure.",
            "Well, if you can see it so I should say it's not totally invisible, right?",
            "What in practice happens is that you know there is some.",

            "On the other hand, fired visible flash at you set so that we get the same camera exposure.",
            "You would probably be quite painful after image in your eye.",

            "And they're going to take an ambient photograph, and it's going to be noisy because there's not enough light.",
            "Instead of green and blue and.",
            "There are two assumptions that creep in here, so we are assuming that there's relatively little ambient IR and UV light.",
            "OK, now if you're indoors then there's something very little ambient TV now that can be ambient IR, and if I can come back there at the end and talk about that kind of helps a little bit.",
            "And we do assume that it is fairly dark here.",
            "Trying to take photographs and fairly low light conditions.",
            "So therefore the flash will be dominated these images when you take the photograph.",

            "Yep.",
            "Yes, that's right.",
            "So the in practice the camera just isn't quite a sensitive to UV as it is to IR.",
            "So you know we obviously want to be careful how much energy we really dump into into UV, so yes, that's right, it is.",
            "It tends to be a little bit noisier than the infrared.",
