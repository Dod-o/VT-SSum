            "I'm professor at the University of Sheffield, Professor of Language and Knowledge Technologies, and I. I'm I'm also director of a startup company.",
            "Is the University of Sheffield Startup Company for this is selling solutions for knowledge management.",
            "Actually what I work with our large distributed organizations, in particular with the with manufacturing companies.",
            "This is both when I do applications or research at the University and as a company director there is one thing that you have to think when you when you when you talk about manufacturing companies, is there no like telecommunication companies?",
            "They are not up-to-date.",
            "They run Windows 2000 and they have been the Internet Explorer 6 and they don't do research in any of the things that yes they were mentioned by.",
            "Bye bye bye Richard.",
            "IT is a cost, so they don't want to know anything whatever they have now is fine if you ask.",
            "Let's install a new system, will take 18 months to have it on the web on their internal web.",
            "So what they ask me very often to do is to try to tell them what is that they have to face today and what is that they will face in five years time or in 10 years time.",
            "And this is what I'm I'm trying to tell you.",
            "What I tell them and I could be wrong of course.",
            "App now one of the challenges that they have now, is that typically, and this is not one company.",
            "A number of companies.",
            "You go there and they don't have a centralized system.",
            "They have lots and lots of databases, small databases, community based community developed locally by the engineers, typically because they are engineers so they can develop databases.",
            "Most of the times are actually forms in Word.",
            "So what they do they they have all these smaller kinds?",
            "Are they called them or share directories?",
            "They used to be very small, but now there's been a change.",
            "There's been a dramatic change.",
            "Storing information doesn't cost anything.",
            "Everyone has a digital camera.",
            "I have a digital camera in my pocket is actually my phone.",
            "I see that I take a picture and there it is.",
            "So if I'm an engineer working on on jet engine and I see a blade like this jet engine blade and strangely bent, I can take a picture and story somewhere.",
            "And these companies have no way to store pictures for, for example, because they just put them on the directories on the shared directory and they all the metadata is the name of the directory.",
            "So we're talking of a situation that is romantic because they have hundreds of thousands of documents or pictures or whatever in archives.",
            "And they don't have a reasonable way to story to to index it.",
            "Let, let alone sharing it.",
            "So their real problem at the moment is if they look at the life cycle of a product that goes from styling to to.",
            "Design to manufacturing to service.",
            "They don't have a way to to close the the knowledge loop so they don't know what happens in service design doesn't know what happens in service manufacturing.",
            "Doesn't know what happens in service, they don't know what they're doing badly.",
            "Very often service redesigns parts that don't work very well and don't tell.",
            "Don't tell design.",
            "I mean we're talking about over dramatic situation.",
            "This is what they need now.",
            "But there is something that is happening that is happening over the next four or five years, and it's going to cause a lot of problems to them.",
            "The problem is, while the increasing complexity of the product's car, every compact car company will have 20 different models, each of them 16 to 20 different versions of the model.",
            "They become extremely complex, so the user manuals, for example, become a kind of flow chart in which you have to go through so you have a 1.6 and is mounting this kind of ties and and the user cannot.",
            "You cannot understand how it works, but also their problem is managing knowledge that is specific to what is actually on the on the car on the on the jet engine.",
            "So did the emergent diversity in the product in the emerging complexity of the product that makes so that when the user takes the object, the object has 17 different functions with another 60 ways of setting them, and they don't know how to use it so.",
            "The real need is that the system tells you how to do it.",
            "But then there is another change that is related to the way they're starting selling things.",
            "How many of you have both occur in the last six months?",
            "Yeah.",
            "What what type of warranty do you have?",
            "How many years?",
            "Approximately 3 or 4.",
            "Not good brand, you should get a better brand.",
            "They typically should have offered you 5 to 7 years, or at least it will be in a couple of years time when they when they offer you have warranty like this, they are not selling you a car.",
            "They're not selling your car there, selling you power or service a solution to your problem.",
            "So you move from a situation in which they sell you a car, and after one in within one year they fix it.",
            "If there is a problem, but it won't happen to a situation in which they are and you pay for everything else that happens to a situation in which they pay whatever.",
            "Whatever happens.",
            "So that means that if they make things better, they will cut costs, and this is a complete new situation in the car industry, and it is.",
            "Absolutely new in the jet engine industry, so the closing the loop they were talking about before is extremely important.",
            "But how do you close the loop?",
            "The moment in which the company is organized in terms of tasks that they perform.",
            "So there is design.",
            "The design Department is design is is organized so that you design.",
            "The car, the different parts of the car.",
            "Then there is a sub, tasks, sub, tasks, subtasks in each database that they have information system they have is task based.",
            "So how do you share with the rest of the company if that is the situation?",
            "Well this is exactly the challenges that they have.",
            "They have to move from a situation in which first of all the task based organization doesn't work because most of the problems are are across the tasks.",
            "So you do everything correctly but it doesn't work together.",
            "And This is why they have communities of practice for which they don't have an organization.",
            "But in the future they will have more and more information coming from service because everything will have will have sensors and the product will constantly signed information.",
            "This is what what John said yesterday about about the web of the Internet of Things.",
            "And that means that every car will have lots and lots of gadgets.",
            "Will try to have to communicate with the cars from whatever is the chip that was mentioned yesterday by Jaune.",
            "That will constantly send information to the emergency services to the car.",
            "Sending constantly data about the usage to the car company or to your family or whatever.",
            "All these will have to communicate together and we have to communicate bottom up, not top down.",
            "You can say oh this is the way you communicate because the new gadgets come to come out too fast.",
            "So the impact on knowledge technology is from my point of view, is that while knowledge is first of all, not, documents are not equal to document.",
            "This is something we have now.",
            "Documents are not just text, there are images, but there is a lot of data, vibration data or sensor data.",
            "The information is no longer just in documents, it is sure in also the structure, the archives.",
            "But there is lots and lots of data that we have to cope with.",
            "Probably the largest amount of part that we have is data.",
            "Data from sensors, so the challenges.",
            "Well, there is the bottom up interoperability that I mentioned before.",
            "Bottom Up interoperability is not just in my in my in my interpretation as the underlying infrastructure.",
            "How do they communicate with services?",
            "Is what you do?",
            "What is the functionality that you offer on the top of it when you when you have a new system?",
            "What kind of new functionality is?",
            "What is the impact on the rest?",
            "I'm so there is a big problem of knowledge mapping what we will call it bottom up knowledge mapping or ontology mapping.",
            "Um, the information is distributed.",
            "There are all these communities that contribute.",
            "Over the whole lifecycle, and you want to make sense of all the information altogether.",

            "There are 15 partners and the idea is to approach knowledge management on the point of view of large scale and and across media.",

            "So this is the.",
            "This is my what I think is is going to be.",
            "This is the impact on knowledge on the knowledge management within the enterprise.",
            "Is is the fact that they must change from a situation in which they organize the work around tasks to a situation in which they have to understand that everyone is contributing to the product and the opportunity for knowledge technologies is in.",

I haven't mentioned it is extremely important when you work with different communities in knowledge management, is there no matter what is the effort that you do to structure the information.",
