            "OK, it did something but doesn't work really well.",

            "Still, we call this engineering science in many ways, but it's like Lego Lego blocks, you know.",

            "So I would say there are two main 2 main ways how you deal with this, so one is.",
            "Then you have vocabularies which try to distinguish, let's say.",
            "Different meanings of particular words, so this would be so vocabularies would be something where you have something ahead of time, and then you try to deal with this.",

            "Too many languages and vocabularies are not easy to get and so on.",
            "South, the most common way how we deal with this style of problems is just statistics.",

            "Very similar property as we saw before with the social network, so lots of redundancy.",
            "So one word might have a problem, but if you have 10 words over 100 words in a document, so you count it there, there is always part of the world's words which don't have this problem, so you rely on this extra information.",
            "What would be experiment which proves this?",
            "So let's say if I would take a document and you read it OK, you would understand it.",
            "So if I would remove I don't know.",
            "Random 50% of words from the document would still understand good part, or at least the topic of the document.",
            "It would most likely still understand the the topic was the document about maybe not the details anymore who does what with whom.",
            "But still you at least you would understand the topic.",
            "So this is what we're trying to do here.",
            "We take a document.",
            "This solves the problem of finding the material you're looking for by looking for similar ways and within the same document.",
            "Now using a portal like a directory access where you go, you walk through the tree using key ways.",
            "If let's say I am looking for Cookie, but I don't know that Cookie is also a biscuit cookie is the word biscuit is the weather was used in the Directory tree house, right?",
            "Then it gets the access because I'm working through.",
            "Street so we hope we hope here, and this hope is justified in most of the cases that, let's say if we.",
            "If you type in, let's say cookie, we would get well different types of cookies, so one is about cooking cream, shopping, cooking jars and so one, let's say baking and confections.",
            "But this would be probably 1.",
            "Now let's check if I'm sure they must be using also other words.",
            "Brownies.",
            "So like here.",
            "All the way up here.",
            "Yeah, so you expect and so in this case it's kind of justified that this document would include also other words for the same, roughly the same meaning and how we treat this with statistics and correlation.",
            "So if 2 words are appearing frequently enough, then it's kind of signal that they might mean something, something similar.",
            "So at this level of representation, so I said.",
            "So tomorrow Michael will talk about different level of representation where we are much more.",
            "More structured and so on, which is more expensive, but let's say here is always the balance between the costs.",
