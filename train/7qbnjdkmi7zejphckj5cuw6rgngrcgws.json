            "So, um.",
            "What I want to do here is look at the difference between the consent and write the data portability through the principle of individual control and reflects on what kind of control we need in order to protect our data privacy.",
            "So first the right to data portability is a form of control, but is distinct from consent.",
            "Consent in theory.",

            "Here's the reminder of the basic assumption of the knowledge and action that needs to be revisited.",
            "The knowledge particularly refers to the knowledge about how data is processed and the action refers to the cost benefit analysis.",
            "Let's assume that the knowledge about the data processing is necessary to make decisions.",
            "So the right data portability is supportive of consent and is even necessary for consent, because when that individual withdraw his or her consent, this act solely does not fully protect him or her from the data misuse.",
            "Actually, the right data, portability and consent bleeds into each other.",
            "The exercise exercise of rights data portability is prompted by the fact that the individual is dissatisfied with the service that she is currently using and want to switch over to another.",
            "Much likely she was full, her consent of processing her data by the original service provider, and only other hands.",
            "The withdrawal of consent is merely part of the self management of of an individual.",

            "What to do next?",
            "What service to use in the future?",
            "And this is where the right to data portability steps in there for the rights of data.",
            "Portability is the encouragement or facilitation of consent withdrawal by making a copy of personal data available.",
            "And the right data portability would further the action and put it in effect by helping individuals escaping from the user login and enabling the opportunity to further use of personal data.",
            "Another argument to be made here is that the significance of right to data portability goes beyond the concept model.",
            "And there are roughly 4 points to be made.",
            "First, it alters the way people make decisions on data processing.",
            "So when exercising the right data portability.",
            "The decision is no longer about whether and how the data is processed, but is about who can access an who is better, so the knowledge required to make that decision are different from the case of consent, and this is the second point to be made.",
            "That is, the right deportability expands the grounds for decision making.",
            "For an individual making decisions on exercising the right to data portability, not only the knowledge about the processing is considered, which is in most cases Inaccessible, explained earlier.",
            "But other types of knowledge is even.",
            "Some psychological factors.",
            "So such factors are accessed not in a purely cost and benefit analysis, but by making comparisons so accordingly the Third Point to be made here is that right to data portability, make decisions easier and more flexible.",
            "So the decision is not made entirely based on accessible knowledge about data processing.",
            "But on a good range of granular factors and it is argued.",
            "That the decision.",
            "Based on comparison and competition is fairly easier for individuals than the cost benefit analysis.",
            "Based on the knowledge about data processing.",
            "So this relates to the benefits of data, benefits of competition and multiple choice.",
            "The last point is that the right to data portability enables new reasons to make decisions in compared with the consent mechanism and therefore enhanced user autonomy.",
            "So what people make decisions about data processing?",
            "They will not make decisions only when they want to minimize risks.",
            "The row that consents plays in most cases, but also one they want to obtain benefits and better services when options are available.",
            "So.",
            "The rights did portability, enables occasions where individuals can make use of data in themselves and have their data processed by kredible controllers."
        ],
        [
            "OK. To make a summary, three points are made.",
            "The first is that the right to data portability impacts on individual control scenario.",
            "By making a shift, a shift from controlling the process of data processing, which requires the knowledge about how data is processed to controlling who can process personal data.",
            "One the choices abundant and thereby protecting personal data by competition and comparison rather than the burdensome.",
            "Cost benefit cost benefit analysis.",
            "And the second is that the OPT N is not recommendable.",
            "And opt out.",
            "Can be made more effective by exercising the right to data portability, and therefore this argue that the combination of the opt out and the right data portability is considered better than the stringent opt North and the last point is that the challenges of big data can be further addressed by exercising the right to data portability, particularly the intangible harms such as the apprehension of future homes or the uncertain T. Can be elevated, not bought information, but by actions of individuals and in addition, the GNU scenario of this system, making enabled by writer data portability does not affect too much by the information is symmetry because we would not make decisions not entirely on the knowledge about data processing.",
