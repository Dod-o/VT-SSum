            "After that, Cliff points out that he's not a statistician and that he entered the field of statistics education through the back door, and I think that the many contributions that Cliff is made to statistics education.",
            "Makes a compelling case for not only leaving the porch light on, but also the back door open for folks like this.",
            "Over the years, Cliff has written some papers with very intriguing titles such as Confessions of a Coin Flipper, and Randomness is well enough understood to be misunderstood and so continuing in the tradition of intriguing titles, Cliff is going to talk with us this morning about the virtues of building on sand.",

            "I actually like going on record that I'm on a statistician and in fact I've now been away from psychology so long they won't claim me either and this used to bother me that I no longer had a disciplinary home.",
            "But I've come to see the advantages of that in that I can't really be held accountable for knowing anything.",
