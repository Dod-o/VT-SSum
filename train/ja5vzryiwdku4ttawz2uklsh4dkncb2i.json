        [
            "So we want to study link formation in hybrid social information networks and we think that Twitter is one of these.",
            "So social information networks are like the web or directed structures with where some notes have been extremely large in degree and social networks are roughly undirected like Facebook, and they have some variation of the connectivity, but not as much as we see in information networks.",
            "So Twitter reflects both of these properties because we have some people who are on Twitter, maintaining social relations as well as.",

            "OK. OK, so the specific process we study is called.",
            "We call directed closure in is the analogous process of triadic closure and undirected networks, but in directed networks.",
            "So try to closure and undirected networks is you have two friends or two people.",
            "A&C who have friend in common be an.",
            "Then you have an edge that appears between A&C.",

            "Follows or is interested in C and B&B is interested in C, then a could sort of find out about C through B and copy that that link there.",

            "So one is that obviously this is for directed structures as opposed to undirected.",

OK, so why would you want to know this closure ratio?",

            "The numbers next to the edges represent both the label of the edge as well as the timestamp of the edge, so I'm going to show you that as one of C is just B, that means that the node B has only 1 two step, half to see through some other node, and Furthermore I'm going to claim that F1 is one.",
            "That means that the edge from B to C exhibits closure.",

            "If the set SK of C has more than 10 elements, they were going to approximate the expected value of FK, assuming that those ages arrived in random order and the reason why we take the reason why we do this, this test for each case separately is that 4K very large.",
            "The expected value of FK is going to be larger than if K will smaller.",
            "And that's just because.",
            "OK, so here in the picture if K is large, that means that a follows C and it follows a lot of other followers of see an for these edge from A to see to see it closer.",
            "It'll all it takes is that it comes after one of those paths.",
            "Since there are a lot of paths, the probability that that happens is large.",
            "Then if there were fewer, fewer.",
            "If your pets, so that's why we do this separately for each K. So what we do is the following.",
