            "What fraction of unstructured fraction of useful data in medicine do you think is unstructured?",
            "Just pick a number between zero and 100.",
            "90 OK, so the very optimistic audience.",
            "Usually I get responses between 50 to 9095.",
            "If you know someone just wants to mess with me, most people would agree that between 80 to 90% of data is unstructured.",
            "So the way all of this started was in 2010 when I got on the faculty 2011 when I got on the faculty at Stanford, I ask myself the question if features are going to get adopted so widely as presumed, and if 8090% of the data is unstructured.",
            "What should a Doctor Who knows a little bit of programming do?",
            "And so the answer to that was to look at the unstructured data and then try to do new things in medicine.",
            "So the most of the focus is on learning something about the disease, the underlying medical condition rather than coming up with fancy algorithm.",

            "Yes, there's there's lots of them, but about 15,000 of them will capture most of the case volume that you see, and you could have multiple semantic groups among them.",

            "So columns are these features.",

            "Explicit negation part is missing, so that's why we have three values, one for present, 0 for absence.",

            "You get responses anywhere between 10 to 20%.",
            "So multiply those two.",
            "There's your 4%, and so 96% of the time you're taking your best guess based on what have you seen before.",

            "We're not there yet at the bedside, but getting closer.",
