            "So.",
            "When it comes to the issue like we're talking bout with sanctions, I would say that you're actually so right that you don't necessarily need a cryptocurrency to build a blockchain, and to actually transfer something of value, right?",
            "But when I'm talking about, I don't get too hung up in that when talking about this alternative idea of an alternative system, because for me it doesn't matter.",
            "So Russia, Iran, Russia, Iran, China.",
            "They're not hung up.",
            "On crypto currencies or blockchain, there's actually some experimentation going on in both and even with Russia, it's interesting because they're creating block there, experimenting on blockchain platforms within the banking sector, but also in government.",
            "China is doing it in agriculture, they're doing it in different ways.",
            "I'm not, I'm not.",

            "Like I pointed out, like transparency, there's lots of good things I'm more interested, at least for my presentation.",
            "Is the application of trying to create an alternative that would.",
            "Impact some sort of security issue now, such as sanctions creating a so if if Russia creates a blockchain that does not have a separate token, even if they peg it to the ruble or whatever, the thing I'm concerned about and want to point out is.",
            "The risk is that creating the creating of an alternative system that will allow them to evade sanctions, you know?",
            "So that's so that's more more focus, focusing on the implications of both of these, and they will have different forms for Venezuela.",
            "They'll create a cryptocurrency if it suits them, and if they can make money, they'll use that.",
            "But if they can use some other sort of blockchain system that maybe doesn't involve just a cryptocurrency token, if they will use it to get around certain restrictions, political restrictions they're going to use it, and I think that's something to point out.",
            "But I will take the case that I will actually take that your input that I could, you know, maybe a little bit clearer about the distinction between the two, and talk about them so people don't get them mixed up.",
            "'cause I think I take take a lot of it for granted.",
            "I mean definitely they need to.",
            "In this particular case.",
            "The additional layer between the blockchain and cryptocurrency not really regulating or changing the way it works now.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Right 'cause the blockchain right?",
            "'cause in essence a blockchain is.",
            "You could say it's sort of agnostic that the blockchain is just a system, right is a system for recording data recording transactions right?",
            "You can use it for any application.",
            "That's not, there's nothing listed that you need to necessarily regulate the actual technology.",
            "Actual code.",
            "Yeah, no, I think that's that's a good relationship, should come.",
            "I'd say somewhere.",
            "In the budget and the application, yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, and I guess but the so I agree.",
            "I think The thing is, are there gaps and will there be loopholes right?",
            "Because so for 90% of people this will be OK.",
            "If there's regulation just like within the cryptocurrency space.",
            "Now most people they go to Coinbase or some big exchange to buy their crypto.",
            "That's where most people are doing it.",
            "So at that layer that's where you have regulation those companies.",
            "They follow anti money laundering, they get your ID they so this really you know I even tried to tell people when it comes to.",
            "Cryptocurrency exchanges, for the most part, there's nothing new.",
            "This is nothing new, it's a company.",
            "It's taking money.",
            "It needs to take your ID.",
            "They need to do suspicious.",
            "That's the same that banks and credit unions and hawala as they all have to do the same thing.",
            "It's not a new issue, it's a new maybe enforcement issue where you have to make sure that the regulations are there and then you go after people if they're not following the laws, but that's it's not on the blockchain, it's on the business level that you have to do it.",
            "But this is the thing though, because I'm trying to think of.",
            "All of the use cases because I like to think of what the criminals are doing.",
            "I think of OK, so if those are in place, how can I still exploit this technology?",
            "And you know, this is that's where the gap is going to be.",
            "The gaps may always be there.",
            "The thing is, we're going to have to.",
            "We should just understand that right.",
            "Crackers exist, then nobody.",
            "Right?",
            "Yep.",
            "Exactly no, I agree, I agree.",
            "Any other question, yes, OK, yeah.",
            "Group which accepts Bitcoin for buying.",
            "Arms for example, but they're paying this Bitcoin to arms producer and arms producer is paying big coin to someone who produces steel and only then this last company changes that to money.",
            "So is this still is it or not?",
            "Yeah, well, it's illicit because of the it's a list.",
            "It would be illicit if they weren't using Bitcoin.",
            "Oh wait wait wait wait wait wait, you say in there by no.",
            "It's a steel manufacturer selling it too.",
            "I think the same principle applies.",
            "The same legal principle would apply, whether it's legal or not.",
            "It doesn't make it because it's Bitcoin, because if I'm so I would just ask the same question if they're using all Fiat and a steel manufacturer sells to someone and that person, I think you just said they would sell make gun right there, making arms because they're using the steel the material so.",
            "Is the is the steel retail or is he implicit in he you know part of this I would just use the same reasoning.",
            "I don't think it necessarily makes it.",
            "Yeah, I don't think that person.",
            "I'm no lawyer, but I don't think that's where the illicit activity comes in.",
            "I think it's the same as with Fiat.",
            "Is that person participate?",
            "Are they winning of a criminal enterprise?",
            "See, this is important in the financial sector because it's when.",
            "People have gone to jail in the United States because it was proven in court that they knew that they were providing Bitcoin or they were providing service to a company that was transacting or facilitating illicit activity.",
            "So if you're you're the crypto company and you're just saying, OK, I just sell people, cryptocurrency and then someone that you're working with or who is maybe in your sort of one of your customers.",
            "You're helping them transfer Bitcoin, but they're really doing it to launder illicit money, so people have gone to jail because they provided a cryptocurrency service for someone, and they were proven, or the courts found that they were aware that they were, that this was basically illicit money.",
            "They were laundry that they were providing a platform for for money laundering, and that's crypto, currency or not, that's going to be seen as participating in money laundering, so it's another case of is that the right set?",
            "The right judgment, or whatever?",
            "But that's that's the issue.",
            "When you are participating or witting, you're knowing that you're involved in a money laundering enterprise, the show BTC E that exchange that's what they were charged with.",
            "That's why the US government work with some other people to shut them down because the legal ruling or the legal charge was that they were knowingly allowing money laundering on their platform and in Europe in the US, South America that would on the books be illegal.",
            "So, so that's where it would be.",
            "It would.",
            "Now someone could make the case that maybe the transparency of the blockchain might make it easier for someone to go after.",
            "So if I see these transactions and I find this terrorist group, I see that there they purchased in Bitcoin and they got the good.",
            "They got these weapons and then I'm seeing cryptocurrency transactions.",
            "Then I could go and see.",
            "Oh well, who is the supplier then?",
            "I would probably go to the supplier and talk to them.",
            "Doesn't mean that what they did is illegal, but as part of an investigation.",
            "I would talk to them because now I can see, oh, this is this is the Bitcoin for that company.",
            "So I now have a place to go to for my investigation, but I don't think it's automatically illegal just like it wouldn't be automatically illegal because terrorists, right?",
            "Terrorists go to here's the thing I don't know.",
            "I don't want to worry if I should say this.",
            "I'll get to your question.",

            "Osama bin Laden.",
            "So in the US.",
            "In the right.",
            "So if Osama bin Laden, if you have a lemonade stand.",
            "And you sell some of bin Laden lemonade.",
            "Or not even lemonade.",
            "Maybe I should use something different the television?",
            "Right, or if you provide him a television under US law, you're providing material support to terrorism.",
            "If he comes in front of you and he says, hey, my name is Osama bin Laden, you recognize him.",
            "You know this Osama bin Laden.",
            "You do business with him providing him services you are in trouble according to you know most laws.",
            "So that's just because you know it's Osama bin Laden.",
            "Now, right, you know.",
            "But if there's some Sama bin Laden, you know, send someone out to go purchase from your store.",
            "You don't know that, that's that.",
            "Let's say you're a restaurant you don't know, or you're an equipment equipment store.",
            "You don't know that that's assuming bin Laden.",
            "There's some proxy that he sends.",
            "That person buys your equipment.",
            "You don't know this, just you're just selling your equipment.",
            "I don't think that necessarily makes you.",
            "You know I'm doing anything illegal.",
            "That's my thought, yes.",
            "So nowadays we have several different blockchains which allow you basically different levels of privacy.",
            "And.",
            "My question is basically, do you think that?",
            "Future.",
            "Properties will be regulated separately.",
            "Or on the other hand, we also have.",
            "Going forward with atomic swaps swaps, yeah.",
            "Basically.",
            "Will get the worst of it.",
            "Final question.",
            "We should buy Monero instead.",
            "So I I will there be different blockchains that are regulated differently?",
            "I don't I. I find it, who knows, so I guess I should.",
            "Probably when it comes to predictions of you know she will, this blockchain B will only be one block chain.",
            "That's sort of a trick question in that if you ask a question like that to an expert or some speaker and they give you a clear answer, then they don't know what they're talking about, right?",
            "So you can, if I were to say, Oh yes, there's going to be.",
            "It's going to be one block chain, and then they're going to be.",
            "There are too many variables.",
            "Yeah, so it's.",
            "Tell me the future.",
            "Sure, and my answer is worth, you know, .0001 Bitcoin.",
            "My 2 cents, I should say.",
            "I think just judging from well, from what I understand about regulation though, I think my biggest hesitancy in saying that there would be multiple sort of rate boxing specific.",
            "At least now we're from where we are.",
            "I find it to be very unlikely that regulators would take such a very specific technical approach where they would be able to specify according to the blockchain and maybe part also, probably because we haven't.",
            "Blockchain technology isn't that developed yet.",
            "For it to make sense to be specific to blockchain, right?",
            "It's very likely that things will change in three to five years, so I don't think we're going to see regulation for a certain public blockchain like Bitcoin, Anna third, or one for Bitcoin and one for theory, and where we have smart contracts, I don't.",
            "I don't foresee that in in the near future.",
            "I actually think that what's more likely to happen is that in the next five years, seven years maybe as far as 10, but in the next five years.",
            "There will be so much development in a particular blockchain or set of blockchains that the regulations will make themselves clear after bad act.",
            "Bad stuff happens like it is often the case.",
            "Define, inform, inform correctly.",
            "I believe that in US.",
            "It's still not quite clear what they're going.",
            "Yep.",
            "I'm not fully because that's a definition by one regulator that says it that says it's a commodity for its purposes, so one of the regulators that deals will come out.",
            "It's like the elephant demand the blind men with elephant.",
            "You know the blind man.",
            "They all teach touch.",
            "One part of the elephant and they think oh, it's a long thing or one says, oh, it has a big, you know it's been like this.",
            "The regulator who deals with commodities says this should be regular.",
            "We see it as a commodity and we're going to use our power where we see.",
            "Commodity type activity happening in derivatives and options we're going to be looking out for that and provide regulations for that, but then you have the IRS, which for their cases will see it somewhat as property, and they've said, so you have two different enforcements agencies.",
            "Once in commodity, the other saying property in terms of tax purposes.",
            "Or you know so you have different agencies in SEC.",
            "What are they concerned about their their concern for anything that looks like a security?",
            "So they're not saying?",
            "The SEC our Securities Exchange Commission.",
            "It's not that they're saying.",
            "All cryptocurrencies are security.",
            "They're just looking for securities like activity, and they will regulate that activity.",
            "They will regularly so, so I don't know if there has to be one definition or one just one definition of a cryptocurrency until the sector evolves more and develops more, then I think there will be.",
            "I think the regulation is going to come new regulation is going to come when it's almost a no brainer.",
            "How we should answer that question?",
            "I don't think it's.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Different.",
            "Property.",
            "Used for different purposes, yeah so.",
            "Recognition is not the question here.",
            "Yes, if they go there and they say alright, we don't know what's happening here like.",
            "Harder to do it with Monero.",
            "And in that case I can see how they could like to turn the regulation of the level you know.",
            "So in that case.",
            "I'm just saying it's better to buy.",
            "I mean because.",
            "From you are going to get the same regulation, but with one you're going to get some privacy and with other little bit less so then the I guess then you know it's impossible to answer these questions without then agreeing on.",
            "Then what is our criteria right 'cause you just followed you?",
            "If I follow your reasoning it's to buy Monero from what perspective from the perspective of the privacy conscious well I'm just I'm just looking at like the pros and cons.",
            "If you have all the same cons so to speak or the hurdles that you need to go through.",
            "Orders and so on that are the same for a blockchain like Bitcoin.",
            "Yeah, I know, yeah.",
            "Oh man.",
            "Yeah, sorry, sorry for your loss.",
            "So to speak, are the same, and the upsides are better on the other one.",
            "Yeah.",
            "As a as a.",
            "So now that conversation is happening with future value, expected value and simply investment being your number one.",
            "Use right?",
            "If you don't use Bitcoin for anything and you don't use, you can use Bitcoin and Monero for the same thing which is holding onto crypto hoping that the price will rise that.",
            "So in that case it yeah maybe maybe Monero has other advantages, But the thing I would ask and I want to get your guys input.",
            "But this is the thing, I will just say though they answer me the question with why not even criminals are using so much.",
            "Well, Huawei is the market cap of Monero still so small compared to Bitcoin.",
            "And why are people who do hacking and cyber criminals?",
            "Why in the earth are cybercriminals using Bitcoin?",
            "When you just outlined how Monero is so much better, why would any cyber criminal use Bitcoin today?",
            "Trust, trust that may be the future value, right?",
            "Also, if they do want to send it to Fiat, maybe they may.",
            "There's a perception, maybe that they think they can turn it to Fiat more easily.",
            "If it's in Bitcoin as opposed to Monero, maybe they just serve more familiar with it, others that they want.",
            "If they want to get rid of it, even though it's public, you know from.",
            "If you are Siri.",
            "Like you want to be sure that there is.",
            "Want the money?",
            "You can do that, yeah?",
            "Yes.",
            "OK. Privacy the.",
            "There may be the.",
            "Yeah.",
            "OK, let's go to him.",
            "Since he turned the optics, yeah.",
            "System adapting to this.",
            "Let's say cryptocurrency.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Reflect.",
            "Development.",
            "Products or services within the existing.",
            "Or is this going to be just something that you know of?",
            "This is, kids that we're not going to be bothered with.",
            "I think it's going to happen differently in regions, but judging by the activity I see in Russia.",
            "China, where the there's less concern about?",
            "Do we need a cryptocurrency?",
            "This talk about there's debate about creating a national cryptocurrency.",
            "Even in Russia, you have one person in the central bank says Crypto Ruble in 2020 have other person saying, no blockchain is not even ready for prime time, right?",
            "So you have that.",
            "So I don't even think we could be too dogmatic about it.",
            "What what are they doing?",
            "They're trying to figure out where to where to apply blockchain in the current infrastructure where it fits.",
            "So in Russia what I'm seeing is I'm seeing several pilot programs pilot projects where they use a software such as Hyperledger Fabric, which is an open source protocol or open source blockchain software that anyone can use and adapt and build on, right, and Hyperledger is built in a way where it does not have a token necessarily.",
            "I guess you can add a token to it, but it doesn't need it to.",
            "So, but you can use it for sort of a closed system where you want to get many different parties to start transacting interacting.",
            "So I see them doing that.",
            "I see them trying to do.",
            "They've done a few bond bond track sensors where they've created a like a corporate bond for like the telecommunications Company where they issued the bond on the blockchain using Hyperledger and it allowed them to issue it so they can.",
            "I guess pilot the ownership and transaction of it, see if it works and it says you know a couple million, maybe $12,000,000.",
            "I see I see.",
            "So what are we talking?",
            "There were talking about a bank or financial institution that uses the blockchain to show ownership to increase efficiency, so it's easier to settle because usually you have all these different parties and the information flow so slow I see that I see that happening outside of the United States in the United States, like I was saying before, there's less incentive to do a Hyperledger project to float above, you know some people are talking about it, but really, in the US banks, that's not going to be their priority.",
            "So I think what may happen is Russia and China were going to see hybrid blockchains.",
            "Blockchain infrastructure even built into the banking like not even just talking about some of the other applications.",
            "But even in the financial sector another even non even non banking Institute, other financial institutions where they have ownership and equity transactions.",
            "I definitely can see private blockchains being used and being built for within.",
            "You know within limited spheres.",
            "Um, I think that's maybe more likely.",
            "Again, no crystal ball, no prediction, yeah.",
            "Is based in.",
            "Let's say let's say some sort of marketing attempt or political marketing, yes.",
            "This idea of bypassing the the cables that were going through the US and connecting directly to Africa, which is a nice idea in terms of you know, the the US dominate with the digital world, but it's not.",
            "I mean it's not viable in any other way.",
            "Mike's?",
            "It seems to me that this is sort of like a political statement slash attempt of.",
            "You know, telling your opponent you're going to do something he has no control over, yes?",
            "Like you know, will this work?",
            "Actually?",
            "Yes, so I agree, right?",
            "The the point you're saying is that just because these states or any entity says they're going to create an alternative platform, is it what we were saying?",
            "Is it going to be viable and that's why my sense is definitely no in the short term.",
            "It just doesn't make market sense for these platforms to take the place or even to compare to swift or to whatever, right these common systems.",
            "But This is why I always talk from my perspective in my lens, which is.",
            "I'm a former security national.",
            "I was worked in counterterrorism, right?",
            "So the mindset that I approach these problems is I come from the mindset of I'm not here to tell you 99% there's not going to be a bombing here.",
            "There's not going to be a bombing.",
            "99% chance there's you know this attack is not going to happen.",
            "That's not my job.",
            "My job is to tell you look, this is the state.",
            "This is where the adversary is.",
            "And this is how they're trying to adapt now.",
            "Like with terrorism right there.",
            "Always say propaganda videos all we're going to do is we're going to create the caliphate where so you have to filter that out and know that 98% of what is going on is signaling messaging marketing.",
            "So that's one thing I see.",
            "So that's there.",
            "But what I should be telling you is OK, you know that they say they want to do this, and you know that.",
            "It's unlikely because of whatever security or whatever, but what you need to know is the policy maker is OK. Now that I know that this is unlikely to happen.",
            "What are the things I should watch out for?",
            "To either ensure it doesn't happen or to have a sense of old things are changing because the assumptions we have analytically, the judgments we have are usually based on a certain set of facts on the reality of what we've been researching and the state of the world.",
            "As it is, we can say a blockchain swift know likely that this is not going to happen is so much that we need to happen.",
            "So I need to be able to tell you that, OK, it's not going to happen in here are the variables.",
            "Here are the reasons why, and here are the things that could change if this changes.",
            "Then you have something to worry about, or then you should start making proactive steps.",
            "The reason why I brought the you know this slide.",
            "Is because this is precisely what I want to leave the policy maker with.",
            "I want them to not get so excited because Russia says it's going to create a crypto.",
            "I want them to look for OK is China?",
            "Does China do something serious?",
            "There's China so all the pilot programs to me mean nothing.",
            "Yeah, some agricultural pilot pilot blockchain that's you know there's nothing to write home about.",
            "But this is what you should look for, because Iranian oil is a big deal.",
            "An oil is a big part of Iranian sanctions.",
            "I would really look out for any oil transaction with Iran that is going to be facilitated by a cryptocurrency or some sort of blockchain system.",
            "Then not saying that that means it's the end of sanctions or but that is significant.",
            "That's something to write.",
            "That's that's something to watch out for.",
            "That has not happened.",
            "That hasn't happened and you know, I think it's unlikely to happen in the near term, so I would really be.",
            "I mean, I'm very interested so I don't have a picture.",
            "I wish I should.",
            "I should have if I had more time I would have put this picture.",
            "This is great example so so you're seeing this is what I'm leaving you with like?",
            "OK, watch what China does last week.",
            "Venezuela is doing all this marketing.",
            "Venezuela is saying, you know, it's Petro.",
            "It's going to start doing trade.",
            "You're not seeing any country.",
            "I think was it Turkey, maybe only Turkey and it was like 1 low level 1.",
            "Maybe one minister for me was the foreign minister, but you know one person in Turkey said, yeah, we'll take the Petro for trade, you know, but you haven't seen anything.",
            "That's probably just seal.",
            "It's marketing, it's you know.",
            "Is interesting is the Venezuelan crypto Office or Department.",
            "They had a delegation from China last week and they have all these.",
            "It's great PR.",
            "They have all these pictures so they tweet about the Chinese delegation visiting Venezuela and they have a lot of things in their tweet where they say you know the Petro is coming because you were talking to China about Petro in China.",
            "You know this is the beginning of the Petro becoming a commodity for international trade.",
            "And what do they have in the tweet?",
            "They showed pictures of the Chinese delegation.",
            "Reading, you know, sitting at a table and reading this booklet, you know that they put in front of them the Petro and they show the picture of the Chinese are reading their Petro, you know, sort of insinuating that China is really going to buy the Petro or something.",
            "Just PR just marketing.",
            "So I don't think you know unless I hear China.",
            "If I if I hear the Chinese Bank of the People's Bank of China posts and say we just met with Maduro, the Venezuelan machine.",
            "We're going to make a plan to we're looking at using the Petro for international transactions that would be significant, so ignore it.",
            "Venezuela says if the if the China does it in China says it and steak steak steaks that claim that would be that would be significant.",
            "I don't know.",
            "I mean, why would they ever do that?",
            "Why would they use the Petro right now?",
            "But it would show that.",
            "OK, maybe their political calculation is so strong that then you'd have to look for follow up.",
            "Even with Iran.",
            "I mean, I'm very aware that Iran.",
            "Iran has been looking at blockchain technology.",
            "Even the central bank has been involved in studying blockchain.",
            "Everyone in the round around the world has right?",
            "That's not a big deal.",
            "If you look at the timing right when the when the US got rid of said it would get rid of sanctions.",
            "Then you saw Iran saying up we're going to do a blockchain where you know we're going to create a Iranian crypto.",
            "Yes, much of that is part of that is for optics, but I do think that they're they're trying to create it.",
            "I don't think you know.",
            "I don't think they're not going to launch something.",
            "I think they're going to probably launch something in a few months, and there's probably going to be a lot of hype.",
            "You could almost say you heard it here first, right?",
            "Whenever Iran comes out with this crypto, there's everyone's going to be talking about.",
            "Oh, does this mean the end of sanctions?",
            "Does this mean now Iran is going to, you know, we're going to have all this financial power?",
            "No, probably not.",
            "But it is still something to watch, because how can we assess the viability of these things if we don't understand the constraints?",
            "If we don't understand the markets?",
            "It's almost as if you have to have this conversation to layout these things, because yes, instinctively like even most of the folks folks who follow sanctions who really understand sanctions, they will instinctively say if they really understand how sanctions work, they will instinctively know that the Venezuelan Petro is not going to be a threat, 'cause they know how sanctions work and sanctions policy, the banking system they instinctively know.",
            "But what I've tried to do is show why it doesn't work, why it's not likely to work.",
            "That's the analytic framework we need to have.",
            "Because then we can analyze any changes and be more prepared to deal with things as they developed.",
            "So yeah, I'm never so my thing is it's interesting because I'm I never want to be a crypto alarmist.",
            "You know, the people who say, oh, Bitcoin is only for bad things, so you know, this Bitcoin stuff is bad.",
            "I'm not that, but I'm also not a blockchain is going to.",
            "I'm not crypto is going to be the best thing to save the world and I'm also not someone who says Oh well blockchain is going to cure cancer, world, hunger, peace.",
            "There will be no corruption because now we have blockchain technology.",
            "I try to just provide a framework of understanding this great technological development that's happening and how it mixes with the security issues that were already following and how it may change them.",
            "How it may advance them?",
            "So at the end of the day, Isis, al Qaeda, you know they're going to use.",
            "They don't care what technology is.",
            "They're just going to try to always find the best way to transact.",
            "So if crypto currencies, this is one another thought.",
            "I'll leave you with.",
            "In all those funding campaigns I showed you, those groups only made a few hundreds of dollars.",
            "Now, maybe in their Monero account, maybe their Monero count has $1,000,000 and none of us will just know and now they have all this money to buy weapons, but for the most part I would assess that cryptocurrency fund raising by terrorists is very small and has thus far been relatively unsuccessful.",
            "So even when I write an article about those campaign.",
            "Yeah, it's like normal is like like not many people are using cryptocurrency so not many terrorists are really using precursore raising much money.",
            "But The thing is then we should also think the other side which is oh so if cryptocurrency does get adopted more.",
            "Then terrorists will use it more doesn't mean that it's more illicit, it just means if it's more easily accessible for people 'cause think about if they're already in Syria in all these places where they might not even have much electricity, they figured out a way to put up again to get an address and to receive accounts.",
            "I mean, there see funds, so if they're doing it now in that way, then I'm sure when it becomes more prominent when everyone, if you know if everyone is transacting more in digital wallets.",
            "And even as this is something to think about, we haven't talked much about the.",
            "You know, not just China, Russia but the the Scandinavian countries which are very cash use, very little cash annarth talking about getting rid of cash.",
            "They're talking about maybe a central bank, digital digital currency.",
            "What is that going to do if we understand if if Sweden creates its own digital currency, it's not going to be like Bitcoin is going to be something different, but my thought is if if they create.",
            "Digital currency that sort of has a similar framework where you not in necessary may be exactly how the blockchain works, but but even if they use some of the same tools like wallets and software wallets, and you have to, you know they have to enable transitting transactions which go from an address to an address.",
            "In essence, even a central bank digital currency could increase the adoption of cryptocurrencies because if I have a choice now with you know the.",
