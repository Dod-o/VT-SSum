            "What we did there, we explicitly correct it for GC contents, and we explicitly corrected for the number of reads that mapped and the number the percentage of the number of reads that Maps.",
            "So there were a few covariates that we included, but then we render PCM and get again exactly the same number.",
            "However, we had to throw out half of our samples.",
            "Yeah.",
            "If it's still amazing to me that you can interpret this principle components, because I would expect biological variation to be smeared across many pieces and not give no it's inability to name in particular, yeah, but much less 800, but even 50 would seem very well did.",
            "The problem is, of course, with the PCA.",
            "The only thing you enforces orthogonality and maximum Lee explained variance, and of course that's not that's not how real biology works.",
            "So these components very quickly become real artifacts, but the point is, you know well you can exploit actually this orthogonality to then correct for them.",
            "So the mathematical properties make it attractive subsequently for the applications that I showed.",

            "Is this better than comparing the cancer sample with the normal controls so your point is right now?",
            "Is that, for instance, when you know you take both biopsy of the tumor tissue and then a nearby and none affect that issue and that of course it would be ideal because then you can much better account, for instance, for specific genetic effects as well.",
            "So the Q TL effects.",
            "So the thing that we right now doing so that would be the ideal situation.",
            "The thing that we're doing right now is combine the cutie.",
            "Else in these components with each other so.",
            "First, correct for all this environmental and physiological variation, and on top of that also account for you know the individual effects on gene expression data caused by genetic variants be cause the components by definition will not capture the Susie Q TL effects, because this is a cutey affects only affects few genes, so that is something that we're trying to do is integrate them to clean out the results better, but the suggestion well the thing your data or what you're mentioning, of course would be much better.",
            "I watching this suggesting the opposite, because in this case it is clear you have the normal control.",
            "Then you compare with the normal control, but there are many cases which you cannot know.",
            "Interesting to know what is the added value.",
            "Or what are you missing if you don't have the normal control?",

            "OK see you will not get the normal control because impossible to get the the biopsies of the normal.",
            "Yeah so for instance leukemia patient that is presenting himself for the very first time to your clinic would you would not get the normal control cases will be interesting to know how much is.",
            "How much are you missing by not having the normal control?",
            "I'm afraid we will miss out quite a bit.",

            "There is a biological.",
            "Select it.",
            "But a bit of expression, and in some cases we are finding.",

            "They have a higher expression viability.",
