            "So it's not something which is.",

            "You should do this work.",
            "That's my first question or remark.",
            "And and the second one is that it seems to me that using tags is basically very similar to use file system where you put things at a given place.",
            "But you have the advantage that you can put the same thing at different places.",
            "So using using tags is basically something that people do for building categories and finding things again, and using an anthology might be much more involved.",
            "You might work with an ontology which already exist that you have to work with, or you might have to build one.",
            "And my question is how do you want to or what are your views of making a bridge between these categories that people can express with stacks?",
            "And an on Perigees, expressed in RDF or or whatever.",
            "OK so.",
            "I'll answer the second question first.",
            "Which is about the tags and ontologies, and that we actually have so much already using the tagging system.",
            "First of all, most users don't know that they can put a file in two folders, even if their operating system supports that.",
            "Using links or something.",
            "So it's A kind of education we do here that you can tag a file with multiple tags.",
            "It's A kind of training you transpose via software.",
            "And in RDF model we represent tags as instances of classes, so attack is not a string tag.",
            "Is it worry and so you can change the name of the string order and it will change everywhere.",
            "And once it sorry it's also a class it can be in an ontology.",
            "It can be annotated.",
            "So we want to have a transition rule starting with a very simple wiki.",
            "But in the same technology that users can use a wiki or tagging system, we have underneath all the power of RDF.",
            "So we want to get them in with an easy feature, but have all the power underneath.",
            "So if somebody comes up with a good idea later, we don't have to change the architecture.",

            "Of course, social exchange is excellent, but we know from and we have research on that also.",
            "So there is a post project and network projected work on this social exchange.",
            "But most of these Web 2.0 websites have different phases of a user and the user usually starts using it as a when he contributes for his own benefit.",
            "So even if I upload Flickr pics on Flickr then I do it to get somehow famous, which is one way or also to keep my own photos or to show them some friends.",
            "Or if I keep delicious bookmarks then I keep them for myself so it's always a use for yourself 1st and then the social things come like this is what.",

            "OK so so quick question.",
            "I've heard rumor that this might be being pushed into KDE.",
            "Is this is this true?",
