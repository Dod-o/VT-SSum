            "In the scheme of things, you know what any individual researcher does tends to be pretty technical.",
            "You're going to be doing something, maybe very mathematical and specific, and it's not the sort of thing you're going to tell people at a party, at least not the parties are getting, and So what you end up doing is you tell them about the applications of where your work might actually end up.",
            "So I say, Oh well, you may be used Google and I'll tell them something about how Google might place ads on the search engine, or I say you know how your digital camera can put a box around the face and automatically focus on it, you know?",
            "That's an application of machine learning.",
            "An I feel a bit dishonest doing that because that's not really what I do.",

            "So in the last couple of years if you go to a store and buy a digital camera, even though it's sort of fairly basic hardware in real time, it can draw boxes around faces and so.",
            "This has now got to the stage where this is something that's routine enough that it can ship to customers who will go into all sorts of crazy lighting conditions and point it at all sorts of faces, and this should just work.",
            "So if you wanted to do that, if you had to go away and write a computer program to put boxes around faces.",

            "So you might start inventing a story about how you did that.",
            "Or maybe I saw some eyes and a nose, and you could maybe put a box around an image and say, well, I know what it knows looked like it sort of got these two dark spots in it's alright.",
