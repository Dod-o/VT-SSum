            "So first just to introduce topic categorization.",
            "Basically, given a set of classes or topics, then we want to determine what class are given document belongs to.",
            "So in the case of social media that the document is opposed and this is usually done based on the content of a document or a post.",
            "And the applications for doing this in social media are that.",
            "First of all, we can categorize existing posts for enhanced browsing.",
            "So for example, we could categorize Twitter posts to allow us to praise them by topic.",
            "The other example of an application is if we want to suggest categories for new posts on creation.",
            "So this applies to a kind of site like a message board divided into categories by topic, where the user has to decide actually where they're supposed to create the post.",
            "Because often a message boards people actually don't know which section of the site they should post in.",
            "So if you could categorize the topic of the post for them then this would help them with that."
        ],
        [
            "So the challenges for classifying social media posts are first of all, they're very short and informal, so there's not a lot of content there to base your classification on.",
            "The second point is that they very often rely on hyperlinks for context, so here is an example of a typical post an from our message board data set, and it says anyone read this worth the read and there is a link to an Amazon product.",
            "Which we assume is a book, but we don't really know what the post is about."
        ],
        [
            "Um, on the other hand, if you follow this hyperlink and look at the metadata of the object, then you can see from the title that it's about ultimate fighting and the martial arts revolution.",
            "You can see that the categories are sports and boxing and martial arts, and you can also see the author name, so this is all really useful information to help us understand that."

            "Look up the post.",
            "So our motivation for trying to improve classification using hyperlinks is that as we just saw.",
            "The post often contain hyperlinks which point to objects which are the topic of the post.",
            "So if somebody is writing a post about a movie, then they're really often linked to that movie on IMDb, or if someone is talking about some other concepts, then they might provide a link to the Wikipedia article in order to let people look that up for reference.",
            "And these hyperlinks often contain knew and useful information.",
            "So in a forum datasets that I introduced later, we looked at all of the posts which had hyperlinks to books on Amazon, and we found that 65% of the posts didn't mention the complete title or author of the book that they linked to, and at least 11% didn't contain any single word from the title or the author.",
            "So basically people enough people often post these links, but they don't really describe very well the resource that they're linking to.",
            "And even though these hyperlinks only occur in a subset of posts and we found from looking at the data that actually the posts which of hyperlinks are quite likely to be a useful source of information, because often posts are just trash like somebody says lol or plus one or I had such a bad day.",
            "But in the posts where people post hyperlinks then they very often actually have some kind of informative information there.",
            "So I think that being able to classify these posts pressure is of special importance."

        [
            "The second part of the motivation.",
            "So how do we concentrate unstructured data sources?",
            "Well, very often people don't just link to documents which have text, but they link to objects which have metadata describing different aspects of the object.",
            "And if this is expressed in a structured way, then that enables us to extract the most relevant data.",
            "So instead of looking at a whole HTML page which might have advertisements and comments and someone related information, then we can actually just select the metadata.",
            "Which is the most relevant part of the page about the object?",
            "And we can also experimentally identify which of these are most useful, because you have lots of different types of metadata, and it's very likely that some of those will be more useful than others.",
            "And recently, the amount of this data that's available is growing, so a few years ago probably it wouldn't make sense to do this, but now, actually, there's enough data that making use of this does make sense.",
            "So in our message board data set of the posts with hyperlinks, then 23% of those linked to at least one object which did have structured data available either from an API or as linked data."

            "We know that there is a structured representation available for that resource on DB pedia.",
            "We then retrieve this structured data either from linked data where it's available or else via API's.",
            "And for our experiments we also retrieved the HTML representation just for comparison.",

            "We used a naive Bayes classifier and this requires a set of already categorized posts for training.",
            "So you need to be able to learn the topics from some set of posts which already have a topic assigned.",
            "We use the post content and the external metadata as sources of textual features for the classifier.",
            "And we compare the accuracy achieved by different metadata types and this is related to studies and information retrieval which classify web documents based on fielded text from hyperlink pages, but they typically consider structural data.",
            "So for example, they take the headings of a web page, whereas we can consider semantic fields.",

            "Then the other two forums where we only got slight improvements by including metadata where the politics forum and the Atheism forum.",
            "And the reason for this is that these two forms actually contained a lot of links to Wikipedia articles, and Wikipedia articles have the title of the article in the URL.",
