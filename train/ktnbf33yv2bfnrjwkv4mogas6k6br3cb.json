            "So nevertheless for you, first of all I should maybe explain the criteria against which we can before we do custom.",
            "So the idea was to to have criteria on based on free curves one almost turning time versus test error.",
            "One was a data set, size was training time and one data set size versus test error.",
            "So I think that the curves themselves make make a lot of sense.",
            "The way the way they are.",
            "The only question that then I think is still there is whether we should should allow people to independently tune each of the points.",
            "That's actually a question.",
            "Are you sure PAL race?",
            "So basically you can.",
            "You can do whatever you want, like like choose a smaller data set subset like a smaller data set.",
            "Like a part of a small part of the data set to to get a small training time or you can stop early or whatever.",
            "You just have a certain certain budgets and you just try to be as precise as possible in given this budget.",
            "Um?",
            "This is this is 1 one question and another one is like in this.",
            "In this data set size was test error which is also a problem that you that you have seen it.",
            "Like if you if you use STD then it's like it's very good and in the end you usually it like it may but it may end in the beginning.",
            "Be not so not so good.",
            "So whether we could like allow people also to too.",
            "Do this independently for different datasets sizes.",
            "So I don't know whether that is anyone having having an opinion on this already.",
            "So.",
            "Now and anyway, so that in another another problem.",
            "Definitely in this in this curve is that some methods may require a lot more training time, so maybe maybe starting behind a certain like at a certain time point very far in some efforts maybe?",
            "Maybe like incredibly fast and only building, so there's no really no real overlap, so it could be could also.",
            "Say OK, you have to.",
            "Your method has to run until I don't know it has to run one day and then then we want the result and we want to result for like all the time points in between.",
            "But it's also something which is not so clear.",
            "Kind of like a Livia suggestion that could just be like a program with no parameters which is submitted.",
            "Yeah yeah I also I also like this a lot.",
            "Yeah so like this.",
            "Just standardized parameters with some sort of time constraint.",
            "And then you know.",
            "Pays attention straight or not, and you can choose a time constraint blindly respecting the design of the program.",
            "Yep.",
            "You cannot force people to think about optimizing well over different times and.",
            "And it would allow you to test different times points.",
            "So this this also.",
            "Yeah, I mean, I also really like this this idea, so it's like we have to.",
            "This would solve the model selection problem.",
            "This would select a solve the problem like the method can be tuned to a certain data presentation or to a certain.",
            "Make make use of summer prior knowledge on the datasets.",
            "And some principle is nice.",
            "I'm not so sure I agree because OK, well, I think that perhaps coming to a parameterless algorithm.",
            "This is the kind of thing we can do with the challenge, right?",
            "Because right here we have many examples of behaviors of algorithms, and perhaps we can learn from this.",
            "But I would say that for the time being, I'm not so sure that we are ready to be parameterized except for for some people.",
            "But, and so I think that if we don't take this into account, then there is no reward for the for the smart early stopping.",
            "You risztics would you?",
            "Would you agree?",
            "Then this is one of the things that you could measure, right?",
            "So one things you could measure is sort of the total amount of computation the program uses, as well as the time.",
            "What is performance?",
            "After that I'm wishing that you get right, so these are easy to measure when the program is running on your own machine, but admits that actually you don't saturate your constraint about your time budget.",
            "Is that correct, yes.",
            "The way that you set up the contest is sort of independent from how you how you actually measure things, right?",
            "So it's very common when you have large datasets.",
            "I think trying to migrate the code to the data rather than vice versa, right?",
            "So that's just with this idea is really giving you.",
            "So then you don't have to shuffle great big datasets over the network, perhaps only only have several one or two examples or something like that.",
            "And then you can.",
            "You can specify some sort of criteria which is.",
            "Something like, OK, we're going to pick some stuff in times when we look at the performance of stopping time will soon look at the total amount of computation that happens during that during that.",
            "So you can give some reward two programs which which actually do some sort of early stuff.",
            "I mean, I think I also think it's it may be possible to to have like some some say bonus point for for method, it stops when it is within 5% of the optimum or something of the best other device, other method so.",
            "Would be when we could somehow on grant us.",
            "OK, so so this this was just this is just about the curve.",
            "So this."
        ],
        [
            "This course we used in a challenge there were derived from these curves.",
            "So because we needed a scalar measure to actually define ranking in the end.",
            "So the way we did it as he used like from this curvy we obtained to like the minimum area under precision recall curve.",
            "Then we took the area under this this curve.",
            "Um, to measure?",
            "Like how fast can listen algorithm already?",
            "I mean, is it already the beginning going going down quite fast and will it take way too long until it reaches its convergence criterion?",
            "Um?",
            "And then for for this one.",
            "For this.",
            "For this for this curve used also the area under this data set was time of test error curve.",
            "So methods that could gain like like a lot using few data points already there had an advantage.",
            "Um?",
            "And as this, as it's usually, I mean for usually fast methods, don't don't want to go like this is a tradeoff between speed and precision, so we try to have a measure for both of these curves where you only had to be within 5% relative accuracy.",
            "So in the precision or so we looked at the time that you needed to reach 5% of the relative accuracy and the same for size.",
            "So this way basically methods that stop that ever stopping condition with which is which is not like this.",
            "I mean it's just like doing some kind of early stopping.",
            "Have also get also some points because they stop like when they reach a reasonable already reasonable.",
            "You know, test everyone.",
            "Yeah, and of course we from the from this other coffee the you got the effort so but.",
            "The problems are there.",
            "I mean the problems we had.",
            "Definitely definitely who didn't really clarify or about participant participant to do so.",
            "Some people for example submitted trained only on a few data points like say up 200,000 and then for the rest just submitted constant outputs, right?",
            "I mean this this way.",
            "This way you basically get a like curve flat and your effort is completely unnecessary ated.",
            "Then others, others here, submitted, submitted like up to certain, up to a certain point and then.",
            "And then just I mean it did not anymore right?",
            "And the problem is like other methods that tried hard to get like some more accused you using more data and get punished because the area is not.",
            "It's not the same.",
            "So this will be fixed now for the final evaluation where we basically just extend this constant up to the maximum data set size such that the X axis has the rights the same scale for all.",
            "But actually on this this curve, it's really debatable because we here also have the area and under this curve and methods, just some efforts have completely different time scale than others so.",
            "It's not really this this measure the area on the discover is just, it's just not a good one.",
            "But I actually have no idea how to how to turn this into something fair to to like.",
            "I mean basically the meaning it should have had is that you the method that is like has low test error already in in the in the beginning is is preferred.",
            "Um?",
            "But I don't see I don't see how we can do it with an area under curve.",
            "OK, and.",
            "Yeah, OK. Never will know, but there there was.",
            "There was, I think there was some problem for yeah.",
            "You could like make your method, I mean bad in the beginning and then I gain a lot but somehow.",
            "Yeah.",
            "OK, so you have to be good, OK?",
            "Yeah, I mean OK. No, actually they're not, so I mean like the most weight is actually gets gets you in the like in this in this in the right part.",
            "So so it's like if you have just training time of.",
            "Like if you say few seconds.",
            "So this is basically does not does not count at all.",
            "Basically what counts is really the last part.",
            "Select few that need 1000 or 10,000 seconds.",
            "So it's not.",
            "We didn't take the area on this lock lock, but it was not loaded with make.",

        [
            "Yeah, so then of course we we had to declare some.",
            "I mean we had to come up with some kind of score in the end here.",
            "So the data set.",
            "Basically what the way we did it with the computer to data set score.",
            "So per per method we input data set.",
            "We gotta score by taking these six values and ranking ranking them for all the participants.",
            "Um and then?",
            "So then the average rank will send the rank for this.",
            "For this data set.",
            "For this method and the overall score was than the average rank overall the ranks.",
            "Um, the problem we you know recognized.",
            "It's good that no one exploded.",
            "It actually is that you basically can create arbitrary rankings by submitting additional additional submissions.",
            "For example, if you if you have a method which is very good in one and one measure, then you just submit on this measure method, which is slightly worse, but just where you can push pull all the other methods down as much as you want, right?",
            "And so they get because of this average, they get just a very.",
            "Very low rank there and your method will in the end spinoff or it's like in the.",
            "So this is a nice nice way to actually win this challenge.",
            "But I've heard that Kennedy also had some kind of multi ranking thing and but obviously no one or maybe no one recognized that there is actually this kind of problem.",
            "So this is this is, I think this is like the most important problem we should we should solve and.",
            "Yeah.",
            "John Langford actually proposed that we we might might use the mean over overall scores, but normalize.",
            "Each of like like so we have this.",
            "If this time we have like this error, precision, recall curve and so on, we basically a normalize all these scores 201.",
            "And then take take the mean over what this is a score and based on this compute.",
            "Um?",
            "I just might just might help.",
            "Yeah, I'm I'm not.",
            "I'm not sure whether this is perfect, but it's, um, it would definitely.",
            "Give different results so couldn't be applied this to the challenge we have now.",
            "Um?",
            "Yeah, the other options would be that.",
            "I mean, there's probably probably some kind of way to to do to compute clever rankings I I'm not aware of any you have.",
            "No, I'm not really an expert in ranking, maybe tossing around some ideas on this.",
            "But yeah, so that's that's definitely an issue.",
            "So then you introduce precision recall curves.",
            "Just this is design.",
            "I mean it's it's a problem like if you design decision was to have this area over precision millwork curve just because data is so unbalanced.",
            "Usually when it's large scale, that test error or this is not so.",
            "Not so useful and he didn't just want to have like a single single point.",
            "On yeah, like in F score or something yeah.",
            "It was just more robust to have an area and under some.",
            "Another code for Pacifico.",
            "There's some ways to kind of when things are very lopsided, you could compute like best constant predictor, and you could use it to kind of normalize the scores to the interval 01.",
            "So you should be so if the Wisconsin predictor had an error rate of 1%.",
            "The feature free predictor at narrating 1%, then then you can take the score that is actually achieved.",
            "You could divide it by .01 and they would normalize the interval 01.",
            "OK. Yeah, so I mean, we definitely had these.",
            "So basically laugh at anybody who has a square rooted in there.",
            "OK, so.",
            "Basically, if you like like it's like what people said that like very precise methods are actually ranked not so high.",
            "The problem really, the only promises to the way we did the ranking cause most of the entries where their entries which were really these linear SVM's.",
            "Well, kind of linear methods and they were all very fast, but didn't have such great results and that's why this this is very accurate method.",
            "Ranked last in all these timing results.",
            "However, when you, when you looked at area where precision recall curve they actually they want when you looked at like this this time and within 5% there was no method reaching this this 5%.",
            "So we also want they actually want three of the six cores.",
            "So they would have had like a lot higher rank.",
            "If yeah, if this ranking hasn't wouldn't have this nice side effect, that's why he mark also also recognized that in the in the very beginning he was like quite performing quite well, but then getting down down, down, down down the ranking.",
            "Also, you did resubmit here so.",
            "Yeah, that's that is the reason.",
            "The reason?",
            "So then then one question that I'm I'm also have is like so we had this effort in all this, so I'm not really sure whether the effort is actually.",
            "Necessary at all two to have it as a score.",
            "So if you can deal with such large datasets, it's good.",
            "But is it is it?",
            "Is it actually cheating?",
            "If you have an effort lower and lower than one in the end because you somehow subsample?",
            "I mean, if you if you really, if you really want to get best performance, you have to look at each data point once.",
            "I mean this is clear here, but.",
            "Is it is this is like a lower to is it?",
            "Is this stupid?",
            "What we want to evaluate this decorative methods and not the engineering efforts and that's why I like the idea that is to send a program and that is ever read by the organizers.",
            "The second one is that we have different criterions.",
            "And we it's normal to a different tradeoff between the training time and quality, and I think that whatever combination of scrutiny and we get, each will always be poor for me.",
            "All the solutions can be optimal.",
            "It's depends upon your constants.",
            "An issue.",
            "Make a linear combination of this criterion.",
            "You will drive the participants towards accuracy or towards training time, and I think.",
            "Having all of the results is a helpful, so perhaps you could have several trucks.",
            "One trucks which favor training time, 1 tracks which favor accuracy when trucks, with which favors the best performance you can get with small training.",
            "Set things like that in order to have a community work in all directions and not in just one.",
            "So but wouldn't it be basically like the same?",
            "Just a single track with different categories.",
            "How we evaluate in the end?",
            "I've.",

            "Yeah, actually.",
            "OK, so actually we thought that people will take a lot more into account, are like the data representation and like also play with placement data.",
            "I mean we had this a setting in this morning and that some of the datasets had actually actually optimal.",

            "I mean, it's basically impossible to get to get the calibration done on because computers are just too different.",
            "Yeah, so like depending on the property of the data set and the properties of the method and it may be that some methods are very keep all the data in cash all the time, but on a different machine the cache size is smaller so everything can change by an order of magnitude.",

            "I thought that people really really use like try different like really different data representations.",
            "So not just just use the the data we created, but.",
            "It's really quite and and try things out as you would do.",
            "I mean, this was the one of the ideas of the change that you that you approach the problem, the way you would approach it when you when you get a new data set so you try out like you look at the data set you try out things and then you.",
            "Improve you basically select your model in a small subset.",
            "Choose like the kernel or venue and use a kernel SVM and then then go only.",

            "Could happen.",
            "But OK anyway, it's definitely easier to just use the given given format, and the question is now should we?",
            "Should we just fix the data from it or is this something it's like this engineering thing which we just like?",
            "I think the most important actually in machine learning.",
            "And is this something we should not not consider at all?",
            "It should be should be like remove this engineering part like that you can look at the data that you see.",

            "Just want to get your opinions on this.",
            "Um?",
            "Yeah, so another question also raised by John was that should we have should be low all data in memory or should it be in like in a different like different that you that data basically has to be read from like only parts of data can be read from this so you have like a memory limit.",
            "Um?",
            "This is also a decision which will change the algorithms a lot.",
            "I mean, if you can only if you only have like 100 megabyte, but you have to process 120 gigabyte data set and you simply have to adjust for this into like the number of passes you have to, you have to do through the data becoming crucial.",
            "So it's a it's a decision one.",
            "It has to make but.",

            "Always.",
            "So then then one.",
            "Another thing I wanted to ask is if?",
            "Actually, if people OK so you're always working with this submission system.",
            "I mean, if there were like 700 submissions, I mean like 700 times someone press submit.",
            "So in the end, what was what was annoying or which feature did you?",
            "Did you miss?",
            "Nothing is worse like perfect.",
            "OK. Mozilla.",
            "That's true, and actually it was also problematic to submit.",
            "To add to submit this in.",
            "Does it 160 gigabyte MB file to from from Taiwan to tubulin in without having the web browser time out here?",
            "So this is also a problem.",
            "Out from this.",
            "Yeah, but OK, but if I would do it like on if I had like for example parts of the Pascal cluster really reserved for the challenge submit just the code basically to discuss how cluster somehow run the.",
            "Run the experiment on one of the nodes and has like just a budget of I don't know a few hours.",
            "Then this is actually all these problems could be solved and then we can.",
            "We could just download the parts of the data to play and an experiment before submitting.",
            "So it's actually I I still like the idea a lot.",
            "Then so I mean this will also solve all these calibration issues.",
            "Selection issues issues.",
            "Measuring measuring wall Clock time is a lot more incentive to do something not linear because.",
            "Right now I'm understanding.",
            "Instead, you know parsing takes all the time, basically.",
            "Yeah, if you if you use the sunlight formula, which is definitely not made for.",
            "For a dense online learning algorithm for this data set, when you're doing like a gradient descent type thing, even if you have a very compressed type format and you end up being parsing them.",
            "Yeah, I mean it's true.",
            "I mean this this this I mean disks because I think if you would then be at like disk speed limit.",
            "I mean there's no passing, no real passing anymore involved because you like Rita raw data.",
            "View is sitting idle a lot.",

            "So any any other comments or ideas?",
            "Or does anyone?",
            "Everyone want to escape from this room?",
            "OK, so then now then I would say well.",
            "To give my my point, I think that we we all, we all agree that having a total order might be too much.",
            "OK, so this is the idea of having several several orders.",
            "Dictated by, say tracks or profiles of interest or whatever.",
            "There is another point which is we must be able to do when some with missing information.",

            "Right, I'm in big because because not all the curves are complete.",
            "And then the the last big issue is that we are we should be say clear about which kind of aggregation.",
            "We want.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So so so basically there is a.",
            "There is a formula which is forged ones for by by the challenge organizers.",
            "This is 1 possibility.",
            "There is another way which is repairing each individual score.",
            "Right, but but again, there were.",
            "There will be the problem of aggregating them in the end.",
            "And the other other possibilities.",
            "I mean, I'm just trying to see whether they are crazy ideas.",
            "For instance, would it be possible that someone submitting.",
            "The results would come with the given aggregation formula.",
            "OK yeah, I mean I just don't know.",
            "I'm just because because this is the big issue.",
            "If we if we want to do it again and I think that there are, there are plenty of lessons learned from this then this segregation story is really the crux of the.",
            "The challenge so.",
            "My person is there.",
            "Yes, we.",
            "OK, and you are happy with that.",
            "Oh well, actually so thanks.",
            "Thanks the organizers.",
            "Before we end, so it's actually interesting.",
            "I mean, who would compete in another challenge if you would do one?",
            "Yeah, I mean who would consider computing so?",
            "Not like yeah, you said.",
            "Uh huh.",
            "OK. Q. OK, at least some.",
            "OK so then yeah.",
            "So if you do another challenge, I think we we really do it the way.",
            "Unlike submitting it to the machine, it sounds like a really, really bright idea.",
            "And then maybe just different different categories and iterating them on like more time.",
            "More QC waited, but it's it's really arbitrary.",
            "I mean, this is like something you define which may not make sense that much.",
            "Otherwise.",
            "Thanks for taking part in coming to the workshop.",
