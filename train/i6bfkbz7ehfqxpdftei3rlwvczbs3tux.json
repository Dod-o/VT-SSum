            "OK, so that's it.",
            "So the question is a great question.",
            "The question is the camera manufacturers must know what they did an we're reverse engineering, so couldn't we just call up somebody at Sony and ask them what they did?",
            "Yeah, I think maybe if we had more connections we probably could.",
            "I don't think they really give out the information.",
            "Sometimes I think the other thing to keep in mind is this is a model.",
            "So the nice thing is our model can handle 33 different types of cameras.",
            "I have given talks to companies that had.",
            "Manufacturer cameras and I have been told why I'm giving a talk that does not exactly what we do right.",
            "It's nice, but that's not exactly what we do and I just say that's nice because I can still model what you do.",
            "It doesn't matter because my model is powerful enough as long as I can get the raw and the SRGB I can figure out what you're doing right.",
            "At least I have a model that can model that, but it's a great point.",
            "And trust me, there's many times where were so frustrated trying to figure out what's going on, because this makes it look easy.",
            "We tried like every possible combinations to figure this out.",
            "And there were times that we wish we could just call somebody up, right?",
            "You know what?",
            "Do you do?",
            "Tell me I'm reverse engineering.",
            "Your camera is driving me nuts.",
            "I have my student has to keep going outside taking more images, right?",
            "That is the great question.",
            "I'll repeat the question so the question is, can you really reverse the gamut mapping?",
            "Yes or no.",
            "So actually you can reverse it, but there are situations and it depends on your training data.",
            "So you get some training data right from the raw in the SRGB and you see how it Maps, right?",
            "You're kind of watching how it Maps from the raw space into the SRGB gamut.",
            "In some cases you'll get multiple points that map to 1 SRGB point.",
            "OK, so that's not reversible, but you can always reverse it back to one of the points, right?",
            "You can have a radial basis function that has points that go One Direction.",
            "You just move it back the other direction.",
            "Just pick one of those points to go back to.",
            "So it is.",
            "You can approximate the inverse, but that's a great question and so we approximate the inverse and it seems to work pretty well.",
            "I suspect that if we did, you know we used radial basis function.",
            "We use like.",
            "The easiest thing we could think of to do the scatter point interpolation.",
            "I think we put more effort into this.",
            "We could probably get a slightly better result.",
            "So the question is, do we encounter any problems with JPEG compression?",
            "We didn't, we didn't really focus on it, so if there are any artifacts that may come out in our errors, but we made a point not to deal with that when we could, we try to always set it in the highest JPEG quality.",
            "So we just kind of assume there was no distortion.",
            "I seem to remember once my student told me if you want to simultaneously output raw and JPEG, some of them won't allow you to do the hyest JPEG quality, but there's something we didn't deal with.",
            "And we have plans to release a nice Unix command line tool like this heroes.",
            "I can do all these things, no, but we we the code should already be on line.",
            "I think if you just Google search for the title or hiking Linda student or you come talk to me afterwards.",
            "We have all the data online or what he's done is in the Macbeth charts.",
            "He didn't actually put the original images online, he puts down the average of those squares of the Macbeth chart.",
            "We gladly give out the data.",
            "We've actually had.",
            "Some groups already get all of our data.",
            "He has all of his calibration code online.",
            "That means we have all of the gamut Maps that own map curves and the white balance functions online for all the different cameras.",
            "I don't know if we violated any copyrights, but we did that and the code is either available or it would be available shortly.",
            "Yeah, but it's a Matlab and it's not one command line, yeah?",
            "Always have to have available roll right, so that is 1 limitation that we have now.",
            "The technique repeat the question.",
            "The question is do we always have to have raw?",
            "Yes, at this stage the way our technique works to do the gamut mapping, we used the wrong.",
            "The SRGB for the point and shoot cameras.",
            "What we would do is we would use since they didn't give us raw we would actually use like an icon's wrong.",
            "We would align it to the pattern, but that's the best we could do right now.",
            "Yeah, we have to use the role.",
            "So the question is, can we we apply this to a more general color transformation like seasonal change?",
            "You mean like if I'm just?",
            "Yeah, that's interesting.",
            "So that's like the NAC, the natures gamut transfer functions, something like this.",
            "Yeah, that sounds like a great paper idea, I think, yeah.",
            "State and it doesn't work very well, but are you trying to say as a as a linear transform?",
            "Not really nonlinear ytr I see.",
            "Yeah, it seems.",
            "I mean, as long as it seems to me.",
            "I mean at that stage you really working with this stuff like my group was talking about earlier where you're just trying to do one color space to another color space.",
            "And as long as you have the training data enough samples, you should be able to build some sort of look up table to do this so you didn't attend her talk this morning.",
            "You may look into that as well.",
            "We may actually be a little bit overkill model for what you're trying to do.",
            "So.",
            "Did you try any cellphone cameras?",
            "We didn't.",
            "We didn't try cellphone cameras, no.",
            "That would be very useful.",
            "That should be the next thing, but we didn't do cell phone cameras.",
            "Repeat the question, I'm not sure I understand it.",
            "The question is determining, oh, I understand the question very right.",
            "Yes yes, yes.",
            "Yeah we thought about this.",
            "So the question is, could you use these color?",
            "I guess sort of the color space or looking the color space to determine which camera took the photo.",
            "Yeah, I think so of course is a little bit you'll pose because of the scene, right?",
            "You may be skewed to believe in if it's a greenish green or blue, you may think you know, but that's something I actually asked my student to consider.",
            "Would be very interesting to think about.",
            "Now that I kind of know how the gamut mapping works, I should be able to look at an image and say, hey, this one has a lot more blue in this space.",
            "That's very indicative of how Canon works or how Nikon works.",
            "Yeah, I think that would be very cool, especially for things like.",
            "Internet vision, right?",
            "People want to do this sort of Internet computer vision.",
            "They want to download it so one the catch with what we did.",
            "I'm going to disclose what are catches.",
            "The catch is we have to know what settings you took the photo under, right?",
            "You have to tell us that it was in landscape mode right now.",
            "Luckily there's a finite number of modes, so we could just reverse all of them and pick the one that you like, but we have to know the settings that you took it under OK, and that's why I think the Chakrabarti's paper.",
            "Is more realistic where they just say hey, if you give me an image it may be very well be scene dependent.",
            "I don't really know what happened.",
            "Right, if you just downloaded off the off the Internet, you have no idea what's happened to it.",
            "In our case, we forced it to be under manual modes where we knew it wasn't doing.",
            "Based on our experiments, we were pretty sure it wasn't doing scene dependent processing.",
            "Right, so the question is really how?",
            "Considering how they go from the raw, like 14 bit down to the quantization down a bit, yeah, actually I don't have any intuition on how they're doing that.",
            "I completely agree with you, there's a lot of high dynamic range is being thrown away when you go down to SRGB, but that's just the nature of doing SRGB.",
            "I don't know.",
            "I don't know what to tell you.",
            "I think what you see is the professional photographers.",
            "They just save everything in raw.",
            "Right, if you really want to do it right, and I remember when we were doing this we were sourcing on, you know, photography forums for white balance correction and people would say hey if you don't have the raw, you're screwed.",
            "There's nothing you can do.",
            "You have to have the raw because it's already it's too late.",
            "And so yeah, there was nothing we could do it.",
            "Even Photoshop can't really undo this, but the good guys just save everything in raw and it's very interesting.",

            "I save everything in raw.",
            "There are no settings.",
            "It's in raw.",
            "If I want to white balance, I can go back and redo it on raw, right?",
            "The raw hasn't even affected white balance.",
            "So that's he's a professional.",
            "That's another reason he's a professional.",
            "He does in raw.",
            "So then we determine this is actually lighting change in the scene.",
            "There's a light on the stage that's changed, so this is the same white balance, but the lighting is actually changing the scene.",
            "Yeah, it was bad too.",
            "Is once you go into SRGB you throughout the dynamic range of your highlights and your dark.",
            "Yeah, absolutely yeah.",
            "If I might add, but I think that in this case, if you have the raw and want to transfer it to a SRGB, The thing is that if you're adjusting the sliders like we see on his left arm, basically what you're doing while you're adjusting the sliders is your clipping the colors into the SRGB, so you can normally see them on on the right.",
            "So I think the the key is if you go to SRGB, you're definitely throwing away data and there's things you will not be able to recover.",
            "Yeah, so we're recovering all that we can recover that we know that hasn't been clipped OK.",
