            "More news written about the stock prior to his recommendation.",
            "More Google searches about the stock prior to his recommendation, more trading volume about the stock prior to his recommendation and just prior like in the five days before you see this uptick in interest in the stock, Cramer recommends the stock right, and so there's a selection bias in the fact that he's choosing to recommend things that are of interest to his audience, which makes perfect logical sense.",
