            "There is a new generation who's growing up who have a much different attitude towards privacy as we did and there is a very clear split and we did some actually hand waving at you at you can actually ask in The Woodlands for interesting questions that shows up that the bottom line is that the people who worry about privacy are typically 40 and over.",
            "The people who are using these tools actually did reach the privacy are 30 and younger, so there is a complete shift actually in that way and I think when we think about privacy we must also worry about the fact that our generation should not put our biases on the younger generation who wants it otherwise.",
            "So it's a complicated issue and I think lots of people who are really in that mindframe thinking very hard about that.",

            "Maybe if we extend the whole theory to labeled graphs can we detect these things?",

            "And all these talks, and there are largely the same patterns show up.",
            "I mean there is.",

            "Typically there is a peak, but then there's a fat tail.",
            "Peak corresponds to the fact that you know if you look at dot Edu web pages then there are somewhat highly connected in a sense that you know those are mostly University main sites you know and so on.",
            "So you don't find very.",
            "Unconnected ones, because by definition they have lots of people linking to that, but nevertheless there is a factor distribution.",
            "So overall the pattern is that you know when you put all these domains together you get a continuous factor from the beginning to the end.",

            "For instance, you have a different network, less in terms of mobility when you are mentioning your neighbors, probably for use unpredictable, but for the for apartments is very predictable.",
            "So it depends a lot on what you.",
            "No, we know, so I'm wondering if your study, in terms of selecting features on condition, which variables you can have.",
            "We would have a lot to do that.",
            "The reason why we couldn't do it in the context of the mobile phone data is the data incompleteness.",
            "So so there are in principle datasets we don't have access to that, but for example, the Paris data that I showed you this wonderful that's based on 15 minutes collected data because for that purpose that mobile phone company they recorded what they normally don't.",
