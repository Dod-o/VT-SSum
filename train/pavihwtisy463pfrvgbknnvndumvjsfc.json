            "And last but not least, thanks to the very definition of elementary risk using this algebra, but on other direction or other dimension we can conduct what we call a through thorough analysis or breakdown analysis in order to identify what is the technical element responsible to an unacceptable level of risks."

        [
            "So after this road map we have implemented a prototype which we called Sarah's composing alimentares to evaluate security.",

            "With the click of a button, this security officer can establish the new security posture of his organization.",

            "For example, in here we can see whether whether which firewall is more responsible than the other.",
            "And last but not least, we can also simulate some security measures in order to evaluate their effectiveness.",
            "For instance, this variability is responsible since the left part is red, so this this variability is responsible to a red level to such unacceptable risk for this one.",
            "However, if we Patch this variability in particular.",
            "The risk level will drops from red to white, which is 0, so this show that matching this variability is the most effective way to treat this risk.",
            "So all what I discussed is in proactive aspects, so we are evaluating and treating security before attacks occurs.",
            "However, we can use the same framework from a reactive standpoint, so we can we can take as input the alerts generated by sensors or what would you call IDs intrusion detection systems?",
            "And using our graphs, we can correlate these others and identify what is the critical machine targeted by the ongoing attacks and ultimately deploye the response measure.",
            "That should stop the attacker before attaining one of the critical machines.",
            "And therefore dynamic risk management can be wait for security evaluation, but also enforcement."

            "To conclude.",
