            "The that's just four is enough and also four is enough that if you if you lose someone for whatever reason, you know three should be enough to get you home again.",
            "The number changes.",
            "I've seen it as high as six as low as three.",
            "Somewhere in there for the initial crew.",
            "OK, so there's a lot of study going on that right now it is not my personal area of expertise.",
            "I just have to say So what they're seeing is that yes, there's this.",
            "Changing the shape of your eyeball under microgravity, probably due to the shift in fluid pressures up to your skull.",
            "It seems to recover when you get out of microgravity.",
            "So the short answer is try to reduce the time in microgravity as much as possible.",
            "The mission profile we mentioned had a couple of 100 days in microgravity, and people have done more than that on the space station so.",
            "It wouldn't be.",
            "More than we wouldn't be more than we've already done an it seems that knock on wood, the restaurants do seem to eventually recover, although it is slower than one would hope when they return out of microgravity.",
            "I, there's been as far as I know.",
            "I'm but I'm behind on the literature on this.",
            "I don't think anyone has proposed a countermeasure.",
            "Aside from spend as little time in microgravity as possible, there may be work on that I'm not aware of, so don't take it with a grain of salt.",
            "Yes.",
            "So I just the idea that there's a particular demographic that's going to work.",
            "I think I'd like to diffuse.",
            "I think if you've got the technical skills that you need, that's important, but in terms of the composition of the whole crew is more about about balance.",
            "So for example.",
            "You're probably going to have a mixed sex crew and I would just like to point out.",
            "An astronaut said this to me is, you know there is no crew composition in which sex won't be an issue.",
            "Whether it's the presence of it, the lack of it or conflict based on related issues.",
            "So don't think that by having a single sex crew, you're going to get away from sex being an issue.",
            "So with that in mind, if you're going to have a mixed crew, one thing that we've seen is you want to make sure that you're not isolating anyone, so you don't want, for example, to have six Americans and one non American bad idea.",
            "You don't want to have six women and one man.",
            "That idea you don't want to have six, sorry 530 year olds and 165 year old bad idea.",
            "Anytime you've got someone isolated, it doesn't.",
            "It doesn't seem to work very well.",
            "Another thing you want to avoid is these potential Rift lines.",
            "So if you have, let's say you have three men and three women, 3 military, three civilian, three scientists, and three engineers in a crew six, that's fine.",
            "That's how, like a nice balance, but what you don't want to have is 3 female civilian scientists and three male military engineers.",
            "Right, that's setting up an obvious rift.",
            "So unfortunately that was a really obvious one, but sometimes you see have these rifts on much on things that you didn't necessarily expect on, I don't know.",
            "Attitudes or sports?",
            "Yeah, you know, our cruise don't tend to get too worked up about sports, or at least.",
            "They do, but.",
            "Only as entertainment, not as conflict, but you can't always predict where this Rift is going to come from.",
            "Maybe their Star Trek versus Star Wars.",
            "People who knows?",
            "But you don't want to compound these riffs with other factors.",
            "So how we're observing the cruise?",
            "We do not have 24/7 video in a Big Brother scenario that is not it for a couple of reasons.",
            "One is that when you observe people like that, their behavior changes and we didn't want to be affecting their behavior in that way.",
            "But also research ethics, the nature of research ethics is that you should only be observing your subjects in order to gather the data you need to answer your research question.",
            "You can't just go on a fishing trip and gather everything and hope for the best.",
            "So instead what we did is we had one of the themes of our research actually is passive monitoring of crew state so.",
            "We've learned so astronauts are there.",
            "Any astronauts in the room?",
            "No, OK. Astronauts are highly professional.",
            "People are fantastic, but they are also liars.",
            "Because when you ask them how you are, how are you doing, they say.",
            "Great.",
            "How are you getting on with your crew mates?",
            "Great yes.",
            "Are there any problems?",
            "Are you feeling any signs of depression or anxiety?",
            "Now, OK, so the problem with self report and astronauts is you don't find out until the problem is advanced enough that it can't avoid being reported.",
            "So we've looked at passive monitoring of crew state, so this includes a whole bunch of different technologies, but one is the sociometric badges, so this they measure the distance between people and the volume of their voices.",
            "So if two people are standing nose to nose and the volume of the voice is really high.",
            "They're probably having a fight, right?",
            "If two of them never get near each other, they're possibly avoiding each other, and these are signs of potential issues coming up in the crew.",
            "Now, at this point in talks, people always ask me if you're recording the volume of their voice, why don't you just record what they're saying, and then you would know if you're having a fight.",
            "The answer is this is an invasion of privacy, but you might say these are astronauts we could invade their privacy were NASA.",
            "This the problem with that is that we've discovered through a lot of research that when you invade the astronauts privacy, the equipment that is used to invade in astronauts privacy is extraordinarily delicate and seems to break very early on in missions.",
            "Tragically, it's happened over and over again on the space station that it's simply miss malfunctions or.",
            "So if you want to affectively monitor accrue, you don't invade their privacy.",
            "So yes, we've been looking at a lot of passive monitoring systems are cruise, for what it's worth, because we're trying to validate these passive systems, they have to fill out a billion questionnaires, billion billion questionnaires, and we try to keep it to less than two hours a day, because otherwise it confounds.",
            "You know, if you're pissing people off with your questionnaires, you're affecting their mental state.",
            "So we try to keep it to a minimum, but it is that we do.",
            "A lot of questionnaires, yeah.",
            "Because we're not recording what they're saying, so it it's it's unintrusive enough that our crews don't feel that they are that it's too much.",
            "There's there's a balance there and that's part of what we're trying to do with our studies is to see if it is too much.",
            "Certainly times when.",
            "The team that does the Sociometric badges they notice that Associated Badge has been sitting beside someone's bed for three days and then they go, knock, knock hello, gonna put it back on again and they're like Oh yeah, sorry I forgot so but that is part of the research.",
            "Are these things?",
            "Visible in practice.",
            "Also, do they give us the data we need, but but one will actually use them while they continue to wear them.",
            "So yeah, it's a good question, yes.",
            "Why does not want to go to Mars?",
            "So there is there's many reasons.",
            "Of course there is expanding humanities presence off Earth.",
            "We know that at some point the Earth is going to be destroyed, whether it's through our own poor decision making or through an asteroid hitting it or eventually the sun is going to blow up, but.",
            "So it would be if you know if it turns out that life on Earth is the only life in the universe.",
            "It would behoove us to find somewhere else to put it, and so that's one of the motivations.",
            "I would say that the biggest motivation is the scientific one, which is that the I would argue the biggest unanswered scientific question that we have is, is there life elsewhere in the universe?",
            "An answer both in the positive and the negative would be change.",
            "Our understanding of who we are.",
            "And what our place in the universe is?",
            "Mars is our nearest neighbor.",
            "If we were to find even.",
            "Long dead examples of microbial life there that would change our self perception and our understanding.",
            "Because if life is in the 1st place you look.",
            "It's probably everywhere, and then that opens up all sorts of other questions about how advanced life could get under the right circumstances that I think is a huge reason.",
            "Of course, for NASA there's also there's political reasons.",
            "Um, there's a for one thing.",
            "I'm sorry I'm going to stop soon.",
            "NASA uses the space program as a means for international diplomacy.",
            "The collaboration between these agencies is an end in and of itself.",
            "Whether or not that collaboration leads to deep space missions.",
            "So there's all sorts of motivations, but for me, I think the primary one is the search for life.",
            "Yes.",
            "The age range could be an astronaut.",
            "So there is the acceptable age range, and then there's the functional age range.",
            "So in terms of accepting applications from people now this range is very big.",
            "I can't remember if it's 18 or 21 is the youngest age, and there's no upper age limit.",
            "That said, um.",
            "There at the time of selection, I think the oldest astronaut at time of selection, if I recall, was 46.",
            "Um?",
            "That has to do with the fitness requirements it has to do with.",
            "You know, if you're going to train an astronaut, which is very expensive proposition, you want to be able to use them for a few years.",
            "And so there's all sorts of practical considerations on the younger end for the education and experience requirements they're looking for.",
            "You're unlikely to be under 30.",
            "Yeah.",
            "No, I would.",
            "I wouldn't necessarily send them to the moon because anytime you're doing a deep space expedition, you're getting a certain radiation dose.",
            "So emissions.",
            "The moon would involve a significant radiation dose, and you probably wouldn't subject someone to that twice.",
            "That would be a probably a poor decision, no?",
            "I would instead send a crew to say an analog like like high seas or like the Russian facility for so they would have a good solid few months.",
            "Of working together in a small space and that way you could test out at least the low hanging fruit.",
            "You could at least see if they were immediately going to drive each other crazy.",
            "And that's an important for test and a lot of their training serves that function of trying them in difficult circumstances.",
            "Sorry, missed the beginning.",
            "Oh and oh, goodness, yes, so there's there's so much potential for unmanned mission.",
            "In fact, many of the interesting destinations in the Solar System is going to be a very long time before it makes sense to send humans to Europa or some of the other moons of Jupiter and Saturn.",
            "That can be very interesting places to look for life.",
            "So yeah, unmanned missions.",
            "I should tell you my backgrounds in AI.",
            "There is so much potential for robotic exploration, but humans are part of that as well, and I have a long standing bet.",
            "With some roboticist at NASA that the.",
            "First life that we find the first non Earth life that we find is going to be found by a human and not by a robot.",
            "That's my $50 that I hope to get.",
            "I think I've asked a few, yes.",
            "OK. Yeah, no human commander for the immediate future, essentially because the nature of command is to be, you know, the Buck stops here.",
            "A good commander relies on the expertise of the experts on the crew and also the AI defers to that expertise, but makes the final decision.",
            "That's kind of the nature via commander.",
            "So I think we're going to call it quits there.",
            "Thank you all very much for having me.",
