            "I thought I was thinking about the Guild quitting and you have the one guy go and then the Guild is left with nine people right?",
            "And it reminded me of Zachary's Karate Club right where you actually have personal.",
            "Even what happens is the karate club.",
            "Actually it's a schism and some people go on one side and other people go on another.",
            "And it didn't seem like.",
            "That was evident in your data.",
            "What you presented here, but I thought it might actually be in the data where where rather than just if one person leaves and then it destroys the Guild.",
            "It's actually that you're one person leaves, and that's just the beginning of a schism.",
            "You know, where everybody kind of agreed.",
            "We're going to split.",
            "That's also a very good question, because that's how we started our analysis.",
            "So we actually looked at what is called rating groups.",
            "So you have gilts and then you have an overlay where you have actually.",
            "A small subgroup of very professional players.",
            "They're all in the highest level, and they just go from guilt, guilt, guilt, pull all the resources out to succeed, and then they don't care about what's happening to the Guild afterwards.",
            "So we saw a significant amount of this behavior.",
            "But for the prediction, because these events are and these examples are less frequent, so we said, well, we start at the one character level and see how far we can get before we start.",
            "Mining for the structures or all the groups?",
            "I mean the rating groups, let's say.",
            "OK, there's a little bit tangential maybe, but I'm wondering if you know the destruction of 1 Guild is sort of the creation of another, and so I'm wondering if you have evidence as to whether the overall system tends toward fewer destructive Guilds or not, as this churn sort of happens and you might be able to see that overtime.",
            "Yes, so we normally observe the destruction of guilt with the guilt change.",
            "So essentially, you can assume that from the data that we are able to mind that there is always like to default.",
            "You are in a Guild and if you leave the guilt you go to another one.",
            "I mean it can be your own one, but essentially you have like a balance on this kind of level.",
            "That's the answer your question.",
            "Yeah, I guess I'm wondering if that is there just sort of an amount there that that balance is constant?",
            "Or is this system tend toward fewer Guilds that are destructive or not?",
            "Or the other way?",
            "I think that it's a system bias because you once you are in a Guild, you normally you have to say.",
            "Well now I'm in a now I go to B, right?",
            "So you kind of prefold.",
            "You go to new Guilds, kind of default.",
            "Choice as far as I recall, they could be larger.",
            "For example, deals can grow and then you have less yes.",
            "So the tendency in the Guilds is.",
            "I mean you can have several 1000 characters in the Guild, right?",
            "So you have.",
            "I mean we have also statistics where we looked into lossy Guilds and also how Guilds grow, but that's.",
            "Yeah, thank you for a very interesting talk.",
            "I was just wondering if you had looked at other methods for looking at cascades of players leaving, like maybe autocorrelation or path models.",
            "I looked into influence models, so where the influence is spreading, but the models you mentioned we didn't look into so, but we compared our models with influence models and that was actually the better choice.",
            "Thinking about data, there was another question there and then I see OK. Not here.",
            "So, OK, I think this talk is very interesting.",
            "I also have one boundary is like have you investigated some network property of this specific players like his between US central Arity or if he is highly connected user or so.",
            "So we we calculated these measures on the social graph that I mentioned but I don't know them by heart.",
            "There's some of it in the paper, but I mean.",
            "Didn't it's not the purpose of the paper.",
            "It was not to actually describe the social graph so question here.",
            "So why we just going so one is more question.",
            "Do I read 20 hours average time playing time?",
            "Speak, but this is in six months.",
            "Yes, yes, so you have.",
            "I mean, the interesting thing is that if you plot the playing time so you have some players who are online all the time, the addicted one, and then you know that government must be interesting.",
            "Yeah, do you consider the effect of friends quitting from the groups that use currently take part in?",
            "Because I think is.",
            "A very important factor in other study.",
            "In network training I didn't get what you said before.",
            "If you consider the friends quitting yes friends quitting, but that was the question before I didn't get that.",
            "I mean, do you consider when user has a certain functional friend quitting from the group?",
            "So if we model the group of friends that quits so that we have a modeling of the Group of friends that quits before the actual user creates no.",
            "So we only model it on the individual level for now, so we didn't do.",
            "I mean what you could consider?",
            "I think if I understand your question well, it's like you could cluster, for example, right?",
            "So you could say I try to cluster my my social network into subgroups and see whether a subgroup of these characters quits, but we didn't do that.",
            "So you don't have friends safe in your problem.",
            "Say this again.",
            "You have friendship network in the set of users you are studying.",
            "Yes, it's only for the user and the direct connections to the friends, so we didn't look at, let's say the overall structure of the Friend network.",
            "So we didn't use that as I mean we had.",
            "If you want we had for the prediction, we had the topological features, but we didn't use, let's say a specific modeling of the subgroups we didn't.",
            "We didn't do that off the subgroup of friends.",
            "OK, last question or before last I have a question too so.",
            "Jimmy.",
            "I'm getting drilled here.",
            "I'm like I'm going to ask very destructive question, why?",
            "Why is Xerox Parc interested in these studies?",
            "How can they map onto the real world?",
            "Well, we have actually a number of projects in that area, so we have experts that are actually doing gaming research and the project.",
            "That's the context of this is actually looking for the anomalies in human behavior.",
            "So we wanted and we don't have data sets that are for human behavior online, right?",
            "Because we have similar IRP issues as universities have.",
            "For example, you can just say are we lock everybody and everything, so we said, well, let's actually look how that looks in the game role, because we have sister projects that really looked into social science perspective of gaming behavior, and we said, well, let's actually apply this modeling on the gaming data and see what we get.",
            "My question is a curiosity while destructive behavior, 1st and constructive second, that is actually the best question where we are.",
            "I mean, for us it's any of the authors played the game plays this game.",
            "Any of the author plays this game, I don't know.",
            "Know know I have to admit I have to admit that could be part of the answer.",
            "All researchers that are involved in this paper don't play the game.",
            "This is actually a limitation I have to admit, but it's just because I think now the answer to my question is more interesting, yeah?",
            "Because that I mean, for actually the real data we want to look into, it's about anomalies in behavior.",
            "So you and we considered that.",
            "The destructive behavior is more of an anomaly, and the constructive one, so we said, well, we start with that and look into that.",
            "For normally training.",
            "OK, let's thank the speaker, thank you."
