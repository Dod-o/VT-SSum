            "That's something that we think that we are putting in a lot of 14 in noon and not only for the use of the of the toolkit itself, but also for the use of network ontologies in regular applications like like the ones that we are going to show now.",
            "So if we if we manage to stimulate a community like like this around the the toolkit, it is probably it is more possible that.",
            "But the things like the registry will be effective.",
            "Otherwise I agree with you that there's no way, yeah.",
            "I actually got this receipt, so I am obviously extremely interesting from that registry aspect is successful.",
            "We we did not have the manpower to register like that.",
            "You just know because we have lost many times that it would be wonderful to have one that people can die and that's people coming into the symmetrical at one of the problems I have is fine mark.",

            "Therefore he said nice and easy to deny it can be.",
            "Backed up by some sort of a serious community review or whatever, it's an I don't have an answer for that because we don't have that, and that's that's why I'm very curious to see how this Visa second part of the answer.",
            "So basically on the community thing I quite agree with Jose and also about the fact that it may not have worked before simply because it wasn't a good time, because now we have many ontologies now.",
            "We have a lot of.",
            "I mean better tools support so that you can have a registry that actually scales and makes sense and is useful.",
            "I am, yeah.",
            "Is your friends?",
            "OK yeah, just to add a tiny bit about the second part of the answer.",
            "Of course we also doing, you know, trying to get this diploid as unearned tool as something as you said, try to put together this infrastructure using Oyster using what's on using different elements to have this registry and to have this collaborative building of a base of ontologies for the Community.",

            "Yeah, but what makes a difference is the combination of oyster with mapping tools and search engine, at least to me.",
            "Yeah, because yeah, where was saying about the infrastructure but in some way.",
            "If we add registry, but well, as you said we key tools.",
