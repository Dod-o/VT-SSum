            "And for this you need some form of semantics.",
            "Typically you use some means of logics of probabilities or logics with probabilities, and there are a couple of very interesting mechanisms around to do this well.",
            "Clearly in the field of image processing processing, probabilistic mechanisms have been more successfully applied at the same time.",
            "You still have a lot of problems where you have to feed in knowledge out priore and their general hope is that by providing logical.",
