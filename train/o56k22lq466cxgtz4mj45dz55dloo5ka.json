            "And then the metadata can describe relationships.",
            "So whatever your sense is, you could say, well, this sense is apparent of this, or this is a sense that's related to this, or even in the when you get to the diachronic view.",
            "This sense is earlier or later than this sense that wouldn't allow you, so that's one of the principles that we had was that we kind of sort of got rid of this sort of fundamental idea of core and sub sense, but encoded it, but allow allow it to be coded.",
            "We haven't done that in the data.",
            "As it stands and we do have a lot of legacy data to deal with.",

            "Well, there's there's two answers.",
            "One is that we we their external outputs, so we deliver them to customers in various forms who use them for various search and retrieval techniques.",

            "And I mentioned it already that the work that's going on elsewhere moves at different paces and at some point you realize that that's really, really worth looking at now.",
            "It wasn't worth looking at two years ago, but now it's it's really relevant.",
            "I think the important thing for us so we have demands we have to move at a certain pace.",
            "We you know, we sometimes have to jump and do something for next week, next month, and so on.",
