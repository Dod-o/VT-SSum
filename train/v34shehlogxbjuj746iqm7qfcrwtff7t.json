            "Well in terms of the our constructs that you used, did you encounter limitations of the language we would have needed more expressive power?",

            "Like the state of the art specifically referring to GPR uses owl constraints description logic to say some specific concept is made up of these concepts together, But the problem with that is that if someone else interprets even one of the axioms incorrectly or differently, the entire model collapses.",
            "So if you say that personal data is anything that is being used in XY zed process and tomorrow use that in some other process, your entire model of compliance collapses based on that one axiom.",
