            "Actually you can show that if you don't synchronize these agents very very very carefully and if you actually don't make sure that the the way they actually come into the network is not done very carefully.",
            "It's not beneficial to have them at all, so I think there is a lot of work to be done in that area.",
            "It's it's a brand new area we haven't dealt with these issues currently because we're moving bottom up right?",
            "So it's we are dealing with one of these problems at the time.",
            "You know, one of the basic job we have to do is educate DHS that optimization and planning technology and scheduling technology can actually do something.",
            "I think they are aware of that issues because they ask us.",
            "Oh, what if I have a donor on this particular application?",
            "What is it, beneficial or not?",
            "And so that's where this studies came from.",
            "But you are entirely right, they are really sophisticated.",
            "Issues for, you know, decentralizing this thing and incentivizing the various agent to do the right thing, and it's not going to be easy, right?",
            "So because you can't tell Walmart what to do, and yet so they can make a big difference in the way they can store.",
            "You know things, then supply things and they have a good supply chain, and so you want to use the supply chain.",
            "So it's a very good question.",
            "So I think we have time for a couple more questions anymore.",
            "Did you encounter any interaction between the skill sets of the repair crews and the vehicle routing problem?",
            "Yes we have different.",
            "Yeah we have different oh So what?",
            "What do you mean that so?",
            "So I would think that you might have particularly repair crews that could do certain kinds of work.",
            "Absolutely so that's what I mentioned.",
            "So when we do, when we're going to do multiple infrastructure currently, what we're doing is solving the problem globally.",
            "Assuming that everybody can do everything which is not true.",
            "So the next step that we're doing now is actually having different crew doing different part of the network OK. And then you have to synchronize them.",
            "So it's like a vehicle running but only some sites can be visited by some of the of the cruise.",
            "But the next step is really these are different agencies, or they may belong to different States and you have to incentivize them to do the right thing because you have to find a way to synchronize them.",
            "But there's still, you know Alabama may not be willing to, you know, you know.",
            "You know, collaborate with Louisiana because they have different you know objective for their particular state citizen, right?",
            "So so in a sense, does the next issue you have only you have different crews with different capabilities.",
            "They come from different states or different organization and you have to synchronize them, yeah?",
            "Have you ever considered that that the people that you're trying to help actually you know, respond to what you're doing and take this into account in your model?",
            "Like you know your restore power in one place?",
            "Everybody goes there, then you don't need to restore power where they came from.",
            "Something like that.",
            "So I think this is OK, so this is a good question.",
            "So I think one of the things that I told you is that in so I've presented things that's mostly static problems here and in practice it's not the case, right?",
            "So they have this decision support tool.",
            "They're going to make one decision, and then they're going to revise the decision and so on.",
            "So what?",
            "So what?",
            "You have to understand here is that we don't want to make decisions.",
            "OK, so we want only to design A decision support system.",
            "It's always going to be a domain expert who is going to make the decision.",
            "So the only thing that we're trying to give them is a sense of.",
            "What they can do and the next step for us is giving them a perspective, which is a temporal perspective as well.",
            "So yeah, so they will be able to play.",
            "It's like, you know, think about the way power system organized right now.",
            "People have a lot of simulator, a lot of forecasting tool.",
            "They look at everything and then they make decision.",
            "That's what we want to give to them and try to give them a longer term perspective on what to do.",
            "So we don't.",
            "We haven't, you know we haven't taken into account the way they react to this yet, but once again you know moving one step at a time.",
            "This is 3 years of work so so we progress very slowly.",
            "OK, I'm going to close with a slightly more technical question, which is the local neighborhood search.",
            "So once you fix part of the solution aneury optimize.",
            "The other part.",
            "Are you typically using?",
            "Are you typically solving that subpart to optimality with MIPS or CP, or is it that you do local search on that part?",
            "Or no?",
            "That's a good question.",
            "I think you can do whatever you want, so typically what we do is we don't serve to optimality, but we search for a good solution.",
            "So what we're trying to do is having a balance between.",
            "So what we want essentially are problems that are.",
            "Sufficiently easy that most of the time you can solve them optimally so that you are guaranteed to have a good solution, but you don't have to solve them optimally.",
            "So essentially you try to say OK, half of the problem I can solve optimally you try to guess what is the right degree of difficulty to solve that problem optimally, and but you don't have to do that.",
            "You can use something else, or you can.",
            "Sometimes you don't go and you solve many of them, but not to optimality.",
            "And and it really is still very much of an art at this point.",
            "One of the things that I want to mention in that area is that what we do is we exploit the semantics of the area to actually find the decomposition.",
            "So we use temporal properties.",
            "Typically, we use spatial temporal properties or in scheduling, you know various machine properties to actually do the the large neighborhood search.",
            "So we have.",
            "Basically, you know the the feature that we are extracting from the problem are basically problem specific.",
            "The scheme is general, but you want to explore some of the semantics of the problem there.",
            "So it's really a very interesting scheme.",
            "In that respect you can exploit a lot of the knowledge to actually drive the drive.",
            "The neighborhood search to something efficiently, but you could imagine that inside the neighborhood you can have another.",
            "You know local search algorithm there is.",
            "It's a very general scheme, it's just a very high level conceptual idea.",
            "It just works amazingly in practice."
