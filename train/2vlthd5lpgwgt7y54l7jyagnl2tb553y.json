            "I think the arc is the need to be there when you have fundamental limits, so typically I cannot trade on my actuation power.",
            "I have maximum talks I can apply.",
            "There's no tradeoff to be done there that's that's a hard bound.",
            "So whatever I do, it needs to be respected, right?",
            "So this is fine.",
            "My contact models the same.",
            "I need to impose certain joint limit contact models.",
            "These are things that are very clear that this is something that matters a lot.",
            "My stability again, I need to guarantee stability if I say oh maybe I can move my hand.",
            "But then maybe I lose lose stability.",
            "While this makes lose balance.",
            "Stability Polygon no you can.",
            "You can put your level right.",
            "That's why we put you have enough degrees of freedom.",
            "We're both want to maybe move more to the center of the Polygon, but if you don't then maybe it's OK to stay more in the at the edge.",
            "So that's a point.",
            "That's why we do so.",
            "That's maybe something I should have explained better.",
            "The inequality constraints they allow you to define regions where it's acceptable to be so for the summer of mass we don't say.",
            "You don't necessary to say the sum of masses to be here.",
            "You can say it needs to be in this region as long as it's in this region, then the other task and move it in the region they're not allowed to go away outside of the region, but it can still move it inside the region.",
            "So from that point of view and inequalities, and that's why they didn't explain the whole thing.",
            "But that's why we need to use this kind of optimization techniques to include inequalities, because you cannot do that analytically because it's impossible.",
            "Yeah, if you define regions where performance is acceptable, then you can solve that with.",
            "This actually is designed to handle this kind of problems.",
            "Typically you control this under pressure 1 foot, so you said it's under pressure and doesn't should not hit the hedge, 'cause when you hit the hedge your food starts to rotate right?",
            "So you have a lot of space you can move anywhere in the within the foot and that's what we do when you hit the hedge then you didn't need to do something so I didn't show here, but we have videos where you push the robot and when the.",
            "So as long as as this under pressure is inside the feet, it's good.",
            "When it hits the hedge then you will see the robots to do very big motion to move it back.",
            "So as long as you're within operational limits, it's OK, it doesn't matter.",
            "So from that point of view the optimality doesn't break your other task.",
            "Thank you for very nice presentation.",
            "I have one question regarding your contact models because I assume that a lot of this work has been done in simulations before.",
            "So how do you model Contacts?",
            "Because the forces that that developed there will exceed this one kilohertz I guess.",
            "Or at least this.",
            "Within what we do handle this, yeah, that's it.",
            "That's a good question.",
            "So so there's two things that the model that showed is just to do the control.",
            "So we make very very simplistic assumptions because it's efficient to do feedback in the simulation.",
            "We use penalty methods to compute the compute the forces in the simulation.",
            "So not with the controller, but the simulator usually is running at slightly higher rate than the controller for stability, so penalty method is a spring damper.",
            "Basically very high stiffness spring number.",
            "I have colleagues.",
            "We use complementarity constraints as well.",
            "It seems to work decently as well.",
            "But yeah, getting good contact models for simulation is a pain.",
            "I don't need answer questions, it's OK.",
            "I would like to ask what kind of fast online quadratic programming algorithms you are using and on what hardware.",
            "Yeah, so the algorithm is so far we're using an active set method.",
            "And the implementation is a implementation called Quad prog that we found online and we tuned.",
            "So we basically changed some of the data structure and some of the some memory allocation thing too because we run on a real time operating system.",
            "So we need to guarantee some.",
            "You know there's some tricks, algorithmic tricks to make sure that you don't lose time, so it's kind of a modified version of something we found online.",
            "There's also we're talking about going towards interior point methods because they seem to be better behaved for kind of.",
            "Easy style problems, but we haven't done that yet.",
            "It works well, I mean nice.",
            "Works well.",
            "Do you do computer?",
            "I think that we have an I7 Intel processor an.",
            "So basically what happens here when you see is that it's all running on one core, so everything is running on a single core, so that the single core is running 100%.",
            "So that's in terms of performance.",
            "I don't know if it answers your question.",
            "OK, thank you.",
            "Any other question maybe?",
            "Thank you for nice presentation.",
            "It's very impressive you have shown here to waste.",
            "The first is based on physical loss of mechanics.",
            "The other.",
            "Is not based on physical loss, but on data.",
            "That means that there are two different ways.",
            "To describe the properties of the nature.",
            "One is the physics and the order is training.",
            "Or knowledge, do you know how to proceed to an optimal acquisition of knowledge or optimal training?",
            "How to make the robot that would all optimally train your robot?",
            "Do you have an idea about that?",
            "Answer No, I have no idea.",
            "The more complicated answer.",
            "Yeah, there's a way you can start to think so.",
            "I talk about Model 3, but we always have implicitly models, so this representation is used to treat to any representation you use to process data.",
            "Is a model right?",
            "So you don't necessarily to be completely model free.",
            "And start to think about.",
            "There's a lot of these algorithms that exist.",
            "You can start to think about what is the next step I should do such that I can maximize the amount of information that I would get out of that, so that would be a way, for example, to think about how do you explore to train yourself is a way to think about what is the way to maximize the information I would get about, you know the robots model and body environments model.",
            "These are visually very difficult problems because you end up in this kind of exploration expedition.",
            "Trend of trade off in learning where you need to decide.",
            "Are you trying to do?",
            "The best you know how to do are you trying to do something?",
            "Maybe that is less good, but it's going to give you more information about how to improve later.",
            "I think computationally these are completely open problems.",
            "I don't have an answer, it's just that you can try.",
            "I think there is something missing and these are how the nature works.",
            "Yeah, do we know the loss of the evolution if you know the loss of the evolution then you could proceed to optimal training into optimal learning and this is what I think the next step in the in the research, in fact.",
            "For the next several years or hundreds of years.",
            "So that's a good point.",
            "I mean, yeah, I mean, there's a lot of things we don't know, right?",
            "If you don't even go that far as evolution, say what's what's the law of control of my brain?",
            "Nobody has any idea.",
            "I mean, nobody knows.",
            "That depends on the on the on the data.",
            "Yeah, if you are swimming.",
            "Have to trade different yeah yeah.",
            "Evolution.",
            "Some are treated differently as yours.",
            "Yeah, that's a good point that comes to the question of finding the right metric to measure how well you are doing so that is going to change.",
            "That's basically the problem of cost functions, so you have.",
            "In robotics we have techniques called inverse enforcement learning where you try to from what you see how people train that you try to infer what is the performance cost that they have.",
            "It's also a very difficult problem, but this is one way actually to do that automatically.",
            "Yeah, but it's completely.",
            "There's still a lot of research to be done there.",
            "OK, maybe we should.",
            "We should leave others for questions that's difficult here, so any other question.",
            "Then I will have the final question.",
            "So you showed how your robots optimized these forces and all these algorithms.",
            "So can you tell us is this how humans do it?",
            "Or how do humans do this for walking so?",
            "What I have no idea first, I don't know, but let me say something I I'm interested in understanding how humans work, but I don't claim ever that what we do is is what humans are doing.",
            "Most likely humans don't have an explicit representation of Newton's Law of motion in their brain.",
            "I don't know how I would be so I don't know.",
            "I have no idea what humans do.",
            "I know that humans control interaction forces.",
            "There's been psychophysics.",
            "Experiment that showed that they also regulate their impedance at contact.",
            "Navy log in as shown or other things like that, so they control different tasks in different things.",
            "But whether they solve quadratic programs and most likely not, but I have no idea.",
            "OK, so.",
