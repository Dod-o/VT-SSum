            "That means their recruiting of the researchers.",
            "To the universities, of course, one part of technology or knowledge transfers, education and training, which is of course well situated at the universities.",

            "12 years ago the city of Grads decided that.",

            "And then they have the final presentation before they have their final exam and then they are allowed to go to the University so that the pupils which are who are 18 and 19 and a half their final project work before they are allowed to go to University.",

            "So basically whether it's a kindergarten child or or an older senior citizen.",
            "Or a resident that has an idea of what kind of service would be good for me and my fellows and friends, but the issue is that their message never goes to the region to the correct person.",
            "So basically to initiate some kind of discussion that just just to start open, openly innovating.",
            "So basically the region says that OK, if you've got something in your mind, a problem solution for something.",
            "Have you found out some errors, some bugs or something like that?",
            "And say it openly to this forum.",
            "It might be a web page or or public communications channel or something like that.",
            "We key and and then the idea would be that someone else can provide with the solution and the idea is to come up with as many problems and solutions or bad things are good thing as possible and then it's easier for a company for an individual company they might have had this same idea.",
            "This same solution.",
            "For ages, but there's no one.",
            "No one from the region has conducted then that, OK, could you find a solution for this kind of thing so so that would be a kind of forum to initiate the well, the knowledge transfer, of course, but also technology transfer in the end, because it's in the end it's going to be solved using certain technology.",
            "Yeah, thank you very much for that input, because just a few days ago I had a discussion at my Department and I said I need to, Vicki.",

            "Actually Twitter might be also good because if the region or a city has their own Twitter channel, someone can comment on some.",
