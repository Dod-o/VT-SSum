            "So my first slide just tries to make this point that the concept of an ontology has been around in computer science and actually in many other areas, most prominently in philosophy for a very, very long time now.",
            "Particularly in computer science, we've encountered ontologies or ontology like structures in all sorts of areas, from relational databases to information science to the semantic web to linguistics as well, under all sorts of names.",
            "So we've already heard about vocabularies an.",
            "We have talked some people have talked about services, our eye as well, schemas.",
            "We talked about schemas, classification, semantic networks, taxonomies, topic Maps, anyone sort of topping Maps.",
            "Yeah, these are all terms which you might encounter if you study some area of computer science and an information science.",
            "And they all refer to fairly similar things.",

            "And this domain can be anything you like.",
            "It could be something very general like the world or culture or arts.",
            "It could be something fairly specific like this swimming pool area.",
            "It could be something that has a temporal dimension, like a day in the life of a person.",

            "Where concepts change, what they are, their properties, their features and time.",

            "So no matter what that domain of interest is, you will build an ontology in terms of those things that are important to you.",

            "It will also mean the users of those software programs of those applications.",
