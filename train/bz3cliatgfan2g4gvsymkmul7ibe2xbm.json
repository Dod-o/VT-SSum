            "OK, you got full circles, but good morning I'm here Dan.",
            "Hello, how are you everything OK?",
            "Your brain is going.",
            "Yeah, good, I normally go really fast, so I'm trying to.",
            "I'll try really hard to stay slow if you see smoke coming out from that box, you know I'm going a little bit too fast.",
            "How many viewer school leaders?",
            "How many of you are heads that teaches?",
            "Yeah, quite a few.",
            "My wife has just started as a headteacher in Rotterdam.",
            "That's where I'm based now and it's her first headship.",
            "Before that she was a vice principle in Hong Kong.",
            "And before that we spent time in Chile.",
            "She's from Chile originally before that Dubai and also in the UK.",
            "So like Dave we've got this great such a privilege to have this sort of overview of global education.",
            "But what I'm seeing school leadership.",
            "I'm seeing two things now with my wife being a real head teacher in an International School.",
            "One is it's lonely at the top.",
            "Yeah, as a deputy as a vice principle it was.",
            "It was OK, but there was always, you know people around you suddenly at the top and it is a bit lonely so it's good that you're.",
            "Coming together.",
            "The other thing that I've learned about school leadership is the extent to which it involves making stuff up as you go along.",
            "And then dealing with what happens next.",
            "Jewelry.",
            "Yeah, an example.",
            "She was.",
            "She's in Rotterdam.",
            "And.",
            "Cannabis is legal.",
            "It's easier for me to get a cannabis and a phone contract in vodka, thanks.",
            "Then then, then yeah, then a phone contract so that sometimes there are issues at school.",
            "We all have these issues at school and she's putting out the fire.",
            "And she had she had this boy in her office and he was trying to be all sort of cool about it.",
            "I didn't do it missing.",
            "She's from Chile, so she sort of looked over her glasses and said don't mess with me.",

            "Sorry, miss any sort of he sang, sang like a bird so you I don't know what he thought she would do.",
            "Have his family killed maybe I'm not sure I don't know so making it up as you go along as a strategy is something that I believe in an with independent thinking.",
            "It's what we've done for years.",
            "But it also overlaps with quality leadership.",
            "And there's a book I've just finished reading all about improvised leadership, which is really powerful.",
            "And also it overlaps with teaching learning.",
            "Complexity theory jazz.",
            "An improvised comedy.",
            "So, uh, come back to that.",
            "I'll come back to that Dave and I have sat, and we've had.",
            "We've planned what we're going to do today, but we don't know how today is going to work out because there's an extent to which we're making it up as we go along.",
            "And that's a good thing.",
            "It's a good thing we teachers.",
            "Sometimes we can be control freaks.",
            "We think we have to like David saying, we sort of plan it out and we have to follow that plan.",
            "And if we don't we get stressed but it doesn't work that way.",
            "I think Eisenhower American said planning is important, but plans are a waste of time.",
            "Yeah, so don't think in terms of changes within your school.",
            "You have to know where you're going.",
            "You have to know every step along the way.",
            "Sometimes you just have to start.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, well, what you can do or think you can begin it.",
            "Boldness, bravery.",
            "Has genius power and magic in it.",
            "According to go to.",
            "So this is what you're doing.",
            "You're taking these first steps and we'll see what happens.",
            "We're not going to tell you what to do or how to do it.",
            "We can't.",
            "Often people say we want we want the system tell us the process.",
            "A lot of people make money in education selling systems.",
            "And the systems do OK and then they fade and then another system.",
            "Can governments like systems?",
            "But to control what we're saying is it's independent thinking.",
            "It's about making it up as you go along.",
            "Get your values right in Dave School when he was ahead, he didn't have school rules.",
            "He had school values 4 where you going well you there for 104 five?",
            "How much do you have?",
            "He had four 4 rules, basically four values, so all the rules instead of having wrote you should do this, just go back to the values.",
            "Are we doing the right thing according to our values for anybody can remember for values.",
            "Yeah, so with the spirit of creativity, making it as you go along, seeing what happens, what I'd like you to do is 2 things.",
            "First of all, because it's time.",
            "Just stand up and just have a little bit of a stretch.",
            "You've been sitting there for awhile, please just sort of stand up.",

            "Just take a deep breath.",
            "Shake your body down.",
            "Your own body, please.",
            "It's not a residential.",
            "Actually, just while you are, let's do the thing I like doing with children just to get the oxygen going into their brains.",
            "Everybody with your right hand go like chop chop.",
            "And now at the same time with your left hand at the same time with your left hand, go sore sore.",
            "You are good at combing your hair, not not so good at this swap hands so chop chop.",
            "OK, sit down, sit better and those four circles.",
            "Can you turn those four circles into?",
            "To be anything, let's say 4.",
            "Four things you would like for Christmas.",
            "Four things, there's no rights or wrongs.",
            "Totally up to four things you would like for Christmas.",
            "Turn the four circles into four things you'd like for Christmas.",
            "Don't mind.",
            "Don't look for rules out there.",
            "My writing demand.",
            "Yeah, when I say don't look for rules that aren't there.",
            "I'm not being flippant.",
            "We tend to think there are rules.",
            "Think there are things that are holding us back when they don't actually exist.",
            "So often we think that.",
            "The other thing is to break the rules anyway, but we'll come to that.",
            "So 4 things you want for Christmas.",
            "So if you just put a diamond on top of each.",
            "Of each one.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Very good.",
            "Yeah, I like that.",
            "And I share it with the person next year.",
            "Share it with the person next year.",
            "Think about.",
            "What?",
            "Was going through your head.",
            "Doing that.",
            "Think about it in relation to think about what was going through your head while Dave was working with you.",
            "Specially with these those activities.",
            "Think about how you are feeling.",
            "It's not just thinking feeling.",
            "Think about how you are breathing.",
            "Think about the state that you're in now compared to before we did those things.",
            "When the research that I've done over the past 2025 years looking at all this thinking, learning.",
            "Memory, creativity motivation.",
            "Neuroscience of learning.",
            "All of that stuff.",
            "The thing that comes through over and over again is it's the state.",
            "That we're in when we learn.",
            "That is the single biggest determining factor.",
            "Of how well anyone will learn anyone will learn at any given time.",
            "The look on our faces.",
            "Our breathing.",
            "The chemicals in our brain and body and they've destroyed.",

            "You can make them all singing all dancing, but it isn't going to happen.",
            "They're not going to learn anything.",
            "Yeah, one of our colleagues in independent thinking.",
            "Is a consultant.",
            "Pediatric neurologist.",
            "OK, so the children brain expert.",
            "Some of the drawings that were on Dave's slides were from his book The Little Book of Big Stuff about the Brain.",
            "Good book.",
            "I was working with him a while back and he was telling a group of educators.",
            "That if you get the state right.",
            "Children can't do anything but learn.",
            "So we've evolved.",
            "Being able to soak up information through our senses.",
            "I'm make sense of it.",
            "But it is state dependent.",
            "So how are you creating effective neurochemistry?",
            "In your schools.",
            "On an ongoing basis.",

            "I heard a leadership education leadership expert talking a few years ago saying for school leaders.",
            "That he'd notice if your face is stressed or just nothing.",
            "Learning is negatively impacted.",
            "Throughout the entire day.",

            "Research shows you can just subliminally put Smiley faces up and people start to feel better.",
            "Yeah, one teacher once told me about her least favorite group, the group she hated.",
            "And asked what she could do.",
            "So I said, well, just pretend.",

            "So she went OK. She said within four weeks.",
            "She had won the group over.",
            "They were now a good group.",
            "So I said, what did you do?",

            "Challenging though you are.",
            "Come again soon.",

            "Giving the impression.",
            "I don't want to be here and I don't want you to be here.",
            "But we have a moral, ethical, professional responsibility to look.",

            "Because we choose to be there, they have to be there.",
            "What's the last thing?",
            "The children see when they walk out of the classroom.",
            "And some teachers go well.",
            "Well, that's when I smile normally.",
            "If they if children walk out like that, they'll walk back in like this.",
            "Because back to the brain we memorize through Association.",
            "Like Dave says, it's not just about that top neocortex.",

            "Terrify of politician.",
            "Ask to see them in your office if you're ahead.",
            "Yeah, 'cause it's scary because of all the feelings and the emotions and so if you want it's the same with staff.",
            "If you're a school leader, if you want Scott staff.",
            "To come in positive.",
            "They need to go out positive.",
            "What could you could you put in place in your school beginnings and ends?",
            "That actually change emotions for the good.",
            "Maybe the music that you use at the end of the day?",
            "Maybe some teachers do.",
            "Some heads will meet and greet at the beginning of the day, maybe the opposite of meet and greet at the end of the day with a smile on your face.",
            "But you have the power.",
            "And little things.",
            "Can make huge differences.",
            "So to what extent?",
            "And it's really.",
            "You make the weather.",
            "As school leaders, you make the weather in your schools as teachers.",
            "You make the weather in your classrooms.",
            "And the weather is important.",
            "So state laughter.",
            "As you hopefully have notice with what we've been doing, just looking at each of these drawings and laughing at them.",
            "I'm laughter is a good way.",
            "Of getting into a good state for learning.",
            "There are others.",
            "But laughter is an easy one when they do research with children.",
            "What do you look for in a good teacher?",
            "And they say two things.",
            "Consistency.",
            "Which includes the rules, the structure, the being firm that all of that sort of stuff consistency the structure is there, and that's where it remains.",
            "And a sense of humor.",
            "Victor Borge Humoriste says the quickest route between two people is through laughter.",
            "There are.",
            "There are learning benefits from laughter.",
            "Students in the research who were played a funny video who laughed maybe like the bubbles and the dog.",
            "Learned better and then recalled better.",
            "Then the students in the research who didn't laugh during the learning.",
            "Probably linked to a chemical called that Dave mentioned called Dopamine.",
            "Yeah, dopamine is your friend in education.",
            "It's like the ultimate learning neurochemical.",
            "And what Dave was alluding to is you have dopamine for two reasons.",
            "1.",
            "When you receive a reward.",
            "Whatever that might be.",
            "OK and two.",
            "The anticipation of a reward.",
            "So doing something that you like doing.",
            "Gets the dopamine going, and as Dave said, dopamine improves our memory.",
            "So standing up and having a bit of a laugh suddenly remembering better what we were just doing and what we're about to do, but also the anticipation.",
            "So coming into the room.",
            "This is where the good stuff happens.",
            "This is where I enjoy myself.",
            "This is where I enjoy the challenge of learning just by walking in.",
            "The dopamine starts to go.",
            "I don't know what age levels you're working with.",
            "But adolescence teenagers.",
            "They're not people.",
            "They there are different things going on in their brains.",
            "From human beings.",
            "One of the things that the adolescent brain is one of the differences.",
            "Is they need higher levels of dopamine?",
            "Just to be awake.",
            "They need that.",
            "And they will get that.",
            "By either because the lessons are engaging, enjoyable, challenging or the positive emotions going.",
            "Or Despite that despite the teacher.",
            "And despite means they'll they'll mess around.",
            "They'll send notes.",
            "They'll be on their phones.",
            "Yeah, I heard a line recently in a conference or teachers saying.",
            "He says, I know you're on your phone.",
            "Because nobody just sits and looks at their groin and smiles.",
            "To what extent are you insuring?",
            "The dopamine friendly sorts of lessons.",
            "Yeah, and for the staff as well that by turning in by getting going to work in your schools.",
            "It's a place where the good stuff happens.",
            "To what extent could you?",
            "Make it so that when children wake up.",
            "And think about the day ahead.",
            "And think about coming to school.",
            "The dopamine starts to kick in.",
            "Yeah, I'm going to the good place.",
            "A little example.",
            "I could say to you.",
            "Tomorrow.",
            "Let's say I'm an English teacher.",
            "Yeah, tomorrow we're going to learn the structure of a sonnet.",
            "See you tomorrow or I could say to you tomorrow.",
            "We're going to learn how to win the man or woman of your dreams in 14 lines.",
            "See you tomorrow.",
            "Is I'm going to teach the same stuff.",
            "But I've got a different parts of the brain getting engaged.",
            "Doesn't cost any money.",
            "It's only a little thing, but all the little things start to start to add up.",
            "Yeah, so state is important as Dave was saying and.",
