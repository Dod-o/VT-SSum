            "So I'm going to start off by saying something quite general about the source of information that we use, especially focusing actually on observations, not merely experiments.",
            "I'll talk about a bit about experimental methods later in quite a broad brush sort of way, but I also want to stress that.",
            "An awful lot of the things we really secretly used to create cognitive models don't really come from doing experiments.",
            "There's not a kind of tight loop in which people slave away in the laboratory, discovering astonishing regularity's and then hurtle back to the computer to try and build a model.",
            "It's there's a great deal of constraint from models, which comes from just little casual, reflection and observation of the world in a way that is perhaps not surprising, but I want to just again to encourage people in machine learning to trust their intuitions and.",

            "So from the point of view of certain kinds of learning methodology, that's a very odd 'cause all your doing.",
            "If you're thinking of learning is a matter of discrimination, for example, then on the face of it, you've got something very puzzling there because I'm just giving you lots of members of a category.",

            "OK, so experiments, by contrast, involve manipulating one or more, and ideally probably one independent variable.",
            "So you just take one thing you are wondering about and you change it and you keep everything else's as constant as you can.",
            "So this would be the case where you for example take the random dots, you see them drifting left or right, and you think, OK, let's make it.",
