            "Nowadays what they do is they take a chip and put and essentially have the equivalent of a middle of 1000 or a million different reagents here, and then they put it through something and then they develop it all simultaneously using these very complex things.",
            "So in a couple of hours they can get millions of test results, each of which with a human looks at it takes a long time for the human to figure out what's going on, and is that good or bad.",
            "So they can generate in an hour something that will keep a trained human busy for a year, and they must do that every hour because what a drug company succeeds or fails by nowadays is do they find the right ones of these.",

            "Which of these cases could possibly be revealing a hydrophilic Arabic?",
            "But all the things I said before hates water, loves oxygen, has two bound, etc OK, and then let's say it comes up with 20 or 30 of them.",
            "Well, then those are the 20 or 30 of them.",
            "You want to test because now instead of testing a million, you only have to test 20 or 30.",
            "Now any extra ones the machine gets that.",
            "Shouldn't have been there, so if you had added one more piece of knowledge that could have made ten of those go away.",
            "That saves a lot of money because each of these you look at is very expensive.",
            "More importantly, if you put in something wrong that causes one of these things not to be looked at, you could miss a drug that could be the difference between whether your company lives or dies.",
            "Literally these the research labs of drug companies have to predict at a level of about one and 40.",

            "If one in less than 40 of the things you try works, you're out of business.",
            "Right, so it really turns out and again I'm simplifying.",
            "Obviously it's really a multipart process, but again, the idea is you want a lot of data pulled together.",
            "A very complex reasoner, and the whole thing to work together well.",
            "So the important thing in this model, which is very traditional AI model it, was the model that expert systems were built around.",
