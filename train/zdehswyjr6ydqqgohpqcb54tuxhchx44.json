            "So and the you know.",
            "Regardless of how much data you've got, then clients can always come up with something that hard harder to optimize.",

        ],
        [
            "So.",

            "Right, so big Data is sort of challenge number one.",

            "If we are just updating our reinforcement reinforcement learning model at interaction points, and maybe you know at some sort of timeout event at the end when we deem them not to be coming back, then these might be infrequent.",

            "Now if we.",
            "If.",
            "Between these interactions, we don't necessarily want to wait a week for them to come back before we can learn the effect of the previous action.",
            "Those sort of delays really don't work if you're trying to demonstrate learning very fast, so much as one of the earlier talks you know we need to be getting immediate feedback from our actions and not waiting until the next interaction, or some sort of timeout."
        ],
        [
            "So this is what I'm saying here.",

            "We tried to use all of these techniques, techniques and other techniques in order to speed up the learning process.",
