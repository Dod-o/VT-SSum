            "We have lightweight ontologies.",
            "We have different kinds of flexibility's.",

            "What turned out to be more interesting was they said, yeah, it's useful to be able to look at these datasets, etc.",
            "But what this is where the social comes into it?",
            "They said, well, it would be really helpful if somebody who has worked in a data set I would like to know who that person is, so that when someone I'm looking at a variable, it should tell me not only which of the variables I want to look for, correlating it with, but show me other people who have used these in a certain workflow.",
            "Show me other documents that are reporting the results from this particular up.",
