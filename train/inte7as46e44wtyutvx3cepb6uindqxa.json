            "I described a way that allows me to find some privacy breaches.",
            "If there is any.",
            "But Furthermore, in addition of that being an attack, it gives me a new definition.",
            "OK, before talking about the new definition, I want also to motivate this concept of KK anonymity and argue that it might be certain scenarios for weights this is.",
            "This might still be secure and give us sufficient Security's official privacy and security so the scenario is the following.",
            "Assume that these are data from from some hospital that they have been anonymized in this way.",
            "So.",
            "I received this data and this is the data where I see it now.",
            "So V. OK, so this this would be the patients that have been received in the hospital, so this would be the whole set of patience passings and this would be the set anonymized.",
            "So I might know that one particular person have been received in the hospital and have received treatment.",
            "Still, I might not be able to link this person with the record here and find his or her private information.",
            "But in order to do this attack with the matchings, I should be able to know.",
            "All the people that have been received in the hospital so I might have the information of 1 particular person from the white pages, but it still might be very difficult to know really.",
            "The complete set of users that have been received by that hospital.",
            "In order to do this attack with a matching so.",
            "We argue that there are maybe certain cases for weights.",
            "We cannot carry out this attack with all the possible matchings becausw still we don't have complete information of all the, so we know for one particular person the public data, but we cannot have all the public data of all the people that represented in the data set.",
            "OK, and this might be acceptable in some cases.",
            "Furthermore, as I said before, in addition to having this.",
            "How?",
            "For this idea with the matchings in addition to give us this attack, it help us to define a new concept of anonymity, and we call that the global 1K anonymity.",
            "So this really leverages this idea of the matching, so take some.",
            "Now take this picture here.",
            "And.",
            "So I have the original data set anonymized and the compatibility edges, and I compute I define the set of all possible matchings, and I look the number of pairs on the right.",
            "But it's guy is smart.",
            "On the left.",
            "OK, so for that particular example the number of guys on the right that match with this guys just one.",
            "OK, but for this guy is 2 for each one of for all of the rest is too because they they participate in different matchings and they have two partners.",
            "So the upper two they match with either of the other two and the lower two with either of the lower two so.",
            "So define this way, my concept of global 1K anonymity to be like if.",
            "Set is global 1K anonymized.",
            "If in all possible matchings.",
            "The number of different partners is at least K. OK, so it's not like maybe a feasible definition, but it's still a definition that we are free to make.",
            "So what we sold is that this definition is still a relaxation of the anonymity.",
            "So every set that is canonized is also global canonized, so this would be obvious.",
            "And also there are sets that global 1K1K minimize but not canonized.",
            "So if so, using this, if I have a data set and I guarantee this property is possible that I get better utility than a set.",
            "A data set that is canonized.",
            "So.",
            "So the landscape of now the new anonymity concept is like that.",
            "So this is what it was before.",
            "This is the new concept of global 1K anonymized.",
            "And.",
            "So again, what I said before.",
            "It's true for here all of these.",
            "ATS of nonempty.",
            "So all of these subsets UCR proper subsets the way you said it.",
            "And.",
            "Yeah, OK. Um?",
            "OK, so we're going to OK. Yeah, and this is important and as far as we are concerned, as far as we can see and think about that.",
            "The concept of global 1K anonymity is as secure as the concept of the original.",
            "K anonymity OK, so this is not really yes.",
            "OK, when I say a secure I don't have it.",
            "It's intuition is not well defined, so to me it seems like it offers the same properties.",
            "I haven't quantified it.",
            "And this is one of the things we want to continue working, quantifying, but intuitively it seems to me that it offers the same amount of.",
            "Of security properties with original key anonymity concept.",
            "OK, so now I'm going to talk about particular algorithms for all of these concepts, at least the ones that are more interesting than others.",
            "And before I (and I'm talking about a practical algorithm about the caring measures.",
            "So this is the original problem of K anonymity that I was talking in the first half of my talk.",
            "So all of the algorithms we saw there, OK, not all of them, but the one at least the one with me and.",
            "My friend, I mean propose is not practical because it has this exponential decay.",
            "So the forest algorithm proposed by the suffer guys is practical, but we're also would like to.",
            "To think about more practical algorithm, maybe heuristics.",
            "Maybe they don't have approximation guarantee, but still algorithms that look.",
            "Good for us.",
            "OK so we proposed a very simple agglomerative algorithm, so it's like agglomerative clustering algorithms.",
            "So the idea is that we start with all clusters being Singleton records, and then we made we merge the two closest clusters and if immersed cluster has size larger than K, we remove it from the pool and we stop.",
            "And what is important is how we do the merging and what does closest mean.",
            "So and here obviously.",
            "We do that by taking the.",
            "The measures of Canon imti into account, so this could be like the entropy measure of the suppressions or whatever.",
            "So we look when two clusters are males.",
            "What is the new measure of information loss from these clusters, and we take that into account, and so it's a very simple agglomerative algorithm and OK can be applied to entropy measures or whatever, and it's for generalized for unrestricted generalization.",
            "So for cell based analysis or whatever.",
            "OK.",
            "It's OK man, so this algorithm, because we're going to have some comparative study with this and the other algorithms.",
            "So the next algorithm we talk about is the K1 anonymization.",
            "Remember that this is the property that I want all nodes on the right to have.",
