            "And we don't.",

            "During the day, the ganache in by in Banyoles it's it's for a sweet wine.",
            "OK, so during the day just because of the temperature, restitution from the soil during the day, the bench temperature can increase to 4250 degrees, so this is impacting so the soil is impacting like that as well.",
            "What is minerality?",

            "She went to a wine she went to she she did with the article from the wine journalist or the article from the summary, and she did list the Attributes attributes which were associated to minerality.",
            "Just doing a survey of what they wrote.",
            "OK, and she found 20 to 30 attributes, meaning that people were speaking about minerality, but in the head behind that they were not speaking about the same thing.",
            "And she found that there were speaking about 20 to 30 different attributes to describe minerality.",
            "So what is now the definition of morality?",

            "OK, I'm just going to take what go inside.",
            "There is no consensus, OK?",
            "So yeah.",
            "There is no consensus, but when someone is telling me this wine is mineral immediately I respect that, but I'm asking.",
            "But what do you mean?",
            "And you will see sometimes people do associate minerality to freshness.",
            "Most of the time OK, and after you have some people where they know that the grapes is coming from a shorkey.",
            "So let's say I feel the shock.",
            "Why not?",
            "Did I answer your question but vacuum we can provide you the publication from demeaning Valenta and and that's a very interesting publication.",

            "That's a good question.",
            "I am going to try to answer honestly.",
            "I think that there is a market for this type of product.",

            "Nothing to do with climate change is just that it's traditional.",
            "I mean tradition is important in in our open countries, but not only sure more and more important and I agree with that.",
            "So there is no it's not wrong.",
            "To love our projects and our country, Ann.",
            "And to love terror projects.",

            "So yeah, I don't like that it's it's so and so that and there is there is there is a market for that?",
            "You know I don't think that it's linked to climate change.",
            "I think that it's just it's linked with story.",

            "It's it's a question for discussion that's bit bit complex.",
            "OK, you did mention also other products related to terror like meat and cheese.",
            "Why do you think that's still the term of terroir is the most linked to grape wine and wine.",
            "And it didn't reach such an importance with other food and agricultural.",
            "Product yet?",
            "Well, for cheese in France for cheese you have a lot of research on cheese in France, where they did show a relationship between the herbs which were eaten by the cows or the goat or whatever you want, and the cheese.",
