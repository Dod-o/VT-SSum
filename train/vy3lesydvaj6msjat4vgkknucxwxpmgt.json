            "So first model is GMP which means every every edge happens independently uniformly, independently at random, right?",
            "So I'm just like flipping coins and here there is no bias for me to connecting to higher degree nodes, so I get a flat relationship in preferential attachment.",
            "It follows exactly this relation with Exponent One.",
            "So I say I'm linearly more likely to connect to higher degree nodes than low degree nodes.",
            "OK and the last one.",
            "Is what I'm plotting here?",
            "Is the relationship for Flickr and 1st you can see it, but it's basically the same as in preferential attachment.",
            "So what this says is that in Flickr you are more likely again to connect to high degree nodes into low degree nodes.",
            "OK, and basically this is the first direct proof of preferential attachment because for the first time we were able to see the exact age arrival sequence and do these plots and see what is really going on OK and the exponents for other networks are very similar."
        ],
        [
            "OK so but there is also a bot to this story, right?",
            "So this says that you are more likely to connect to high degree nodes, but the next question you can ask is how does your probability of linking depends also on how far in the network the target node is.",
            "So what will be asking is just before a particular edge appears in the network, how far away in the number of hops were the two endpoints OK and again in GMP there's no bias for you to connect.",
            "You have the same probability of to connect to someone who's either close or far.",
            "So you get these flat relationship.",
            "Basically the probability is uniform in preferential attachment.",
            "You get some exponential relationship and and the.",
            "And this happens just because of degree correlations, because you are more likely to connect to high degree nodes.",
            "But if you look at real data, for example Flickr, you get this super exponential dropoff.",
            "So basically what I'm saying here is you are like 2 orders of magnitude more likely to link to someone who's two hops away.",
            "When someone who's three hops away.",
            "OK, so even though you are more likely to connect to high degree nodes, you are also much more likely to connect to someone who's very close and to someone who's, let's say very far in the network.",
            "OK, so the conclusion carries.",
            "I just said local and actually most of them close triangles, right?",
            "And what I mean by that is this is a triangle closing gadgets, right?",
            "I have this.",
            "This edge that connects something that originally was two hops apart, and if you just unroll the evolution of, for example Flickr, and count how many edges are there that closed triangles, you find like 66% of all the edges will close triangles.",
            "So now the question is, how can I best?"
        ],
        [
            "Close triangles.",
            "And the way we model this is the following, right?",
            "So if I know that this particular UW Edge will appear next in the network, then I will follow these sort of two independent events first.",
            "No, you have to choose a neighbor and then node V has to choose a neighbor and then this edge appears.",
            "OK, so we have basically two things to do first.",
            "Which you choose is unable and then whatever we chose, this guy chooses another neighbor.",
            "OK and we model.",
            "Basically we consider 25 different options of choosing V and then choosing W. For each of these options, we can compute the log likelihood of basically to get the score of what is the best way to close this triangles and to make the whole story short, it turns out that the best way to close such to create this triangle edges is to basically choose neighbors depending on the number of common friends and the time since last activity.",
            "So basically what this means is you want to choose friends that in a way that is biased toward people you have a lot of common friends with, and two active people, so people don't have short short time since last activity.",
            "But what also works quite well and it's sort of in some sense surprising is that just choosing a random neighbor will also give you quite good results, and this intuitively makes sense because by choosing to hop random neighbors you are more likely to hit basically high degree guys, right?",
            "High degree guys have multiple multiple paths leading to them, so this way you sort of get something like local preferential attachment if you like OK.",
            "So this basically now completes.",
            "The modeling part, and now I want to show you one application which is basically how to generate graphs that look realistically and you don't care of what underlying pro."

            "This generated them.",

            "What it is we just want to generate it.",
            "So the problem will be that you give me a real network from some domain and ask me to generate your synthetic counterpart so that now if you somehow compare these two networks, let's say you compute the degree distribution or some other statistics, these two statistics will match.",

            "OK, so there are many applications and there are two questions one.",

        [
            "And the the formulation or the OR the formalism we are using this called Chronicle graphs, right?",

            "It's a.",
            "It's a good point and I think the only sort of the the basically the work of fabric content.",
            "Papadimitriou is.",
            "I think the only one where there is some kind of optimization going on right where they say you know you want to create links, but you don't want them to be too long and then power loss naturally emerge from them.",
            "And then there are.",
            "I think there is lots of connections to like game theory and so on.",
            "Also like how to design these things.",

            "So this densification.",
            "Understand.",
            "So personally use this graph with the citations.",
            "Read the graph correctly.",
            "At the beginning you have like an average less than one citation for paper, and then this translation you're ending up with about 50 citation computer papers actually having more citations overtime.",
            "Or are the citations in the network.",
            "It's both.",
            "Actually we check both, so it's true what you are saying that if you start collecting a citation network, you will have this problem of taking a paper and not having sort of the history right?",
            "So you have to start collecting at one point and actually we're checking for that, and our conclusions don't don't change and we also have networks.",
            "For example the networks I showed this like LinkedIn and so on, right?",
            "They're complete networks there we really know all the edges that happened and they're still densifying so.",
            "It seems densification is that for to answer about papers specifically.",
            "Yeah, we also just measure it.",
            "What's the average number of citations of paper has and that also increases overtime?",
            "So yeah, our reference lists are getting longer.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Is there a difference if you look at say median versus mean so so like if I have if I have a distribution who's with the heavy tail, overtime, new samples and distribution?",
            "The mean value can go off.",
            "Whereas the media, yeah.",
            "I wonder?",
            "But the bigger question here is some of them.",

            "Type other systems, perhaps, maybe not.",
            "Do you know Princess?",
            "Is the comedian degree going up as well so the industry or you know it's been three years so I don't have a good answer about median.",
            "We definitely check like the average and that was going up.",
            "Maybe we should check median again.",
            "So this would basically tell us is it like you know, is it on the average in some sense or is it like you know, the tale Guy said no more survey papers are being done.",
            "And then for so for robustness.",
            "So what we know about networks is that you know if you go and remove random notes from the network, then you really need to remove a lot to change things.",
            "But if you go and remove high degree ones you will really change things a lot, which seems to be like a universal property of networks and.",
            "Now, of course the question is, you know how many malicious people are there that would be doing that to destroy.",
            "But I don't know if I have a better answer.",
            "I mean, in general we know that yeah, if we go and mess up with high degree people that are there for whatever reason, they are there that would mess up the network a lot.",
            "And that's probably the reason because we have these skewed distributions and then and this sort of extreme people are much more extreme than they would be if we would have.",
            "If we would have, I know Gaussian distributions and things like that.",
            "OK, so let me just end with a crazy question.",
            "So.",
            "Or so forth.",
            "So when, when, for instance, physicists, like they have models of how galaxies evolve and so forth, so there they they actually have.",

            "So that if we understand things correctly, they should be able to create these simulations in some sense are indistinguishable from the true observation.",
            "Random sequence.",
            "Random sequence, you know there should be no small tests interesting, I wonder is there is there hope?",
            "To what extent might there be hope of doing that sort of thing for these kind of networks?",
            "You know they have a model that's good enough and you could say here are two, you know, huge networks you try to distinguish which is the real Flickr and which is the fake one.",
            "So I mean, I actually want to take some sticker statistics.",
            "Happy we want to fit, so there's some hope to really get something that you know.",
            "Really works.",
            "Can't you can't tell?",
            "I mean, I'm already excited now because sort of we are able to do to sort of model humans as galaxies right?",
            "Or we see that even humans are no different from galaxies in some sense, which is sort of funny right?",
            "On the other hand, I don't think we are there yet, but hopefully we will be someday.",
            "The question is also what statistics does one taken sort of because also right.",
            "For example, one problem today is like I showed you I showed you at least two models in my talk.",
            "Of the same thing, right?",
            "So depending on what at what granularity you want to model, you choose a different model, so.",
            "We still don't have one ultimate model that would do everything correctly at sort of individual edge level, and as if I run more long enough and I take this global statistic, everything would still work.",
            "So one thing that we're doing is getting this to sort of use together and trying to do everything by single model so I don't.",
            "I don't know if I can say more.",
            "Questions on several of the boxes should be started.",
            "Next to the question, just ask.",
            "When?",
            "When you construct these Chronicle graphs, you gave some plots that said, well, the distributions look similar to what?",
            "Testing the distributions to.",
            "Test statistically whether they are same or not.",
            "Harman, when I compare statistics.",
            "No, no.",
            "I mean, I haven't done that because I'm not really sort of.",
            "So what I know like I can prove that distributions will have this particular parametric forms right.",
            "What this proves don't tell you is how these distributions are correlated in some sense, right?",
            "I can say for some value of parameters I can get this type of degree distribution for some value of parameters may be different.",
            "I can give you this diameter, right?",
            "What I then I OK then I go.",
            "I feed this through through this maximum likelihood where I just forget about these properties, try to match the matrices.",
            "And then what is sort of surprising is that I can match sort of several of them at the same time.",
            "Without actually committing to them so, but I haven't done tests then to say, oh, I really get this exactly or something so I know I know what parametric forms it will be, but I haven't done, for example, the statistics tests on them.",
            "Whether parameters are the same of the distributions and so on.",
            "But right now I just plotted and said, well, look, that's all.",
            "So on the upper right box.",
            "So it was more impressive that you know this size of this data set my eyes with the social network is planetary scale is recalling it.",
            "I was just wondering when I was looking at the things you were looking at, a lot of them were.",
            "Sort of aggregate behavior in advertisements.",
            "Just wondering if.",
            "There was anything you saw in Vernalis here.",
            "That you wouldn't have seen son say in order of magnitude with two orders of magnitude less data.",
            "So the reason maybe first I should say the reason why I was doing aggregate statistics is also because this data is very privacy sensitive, right so?",
            "Going after users you don't want to do that, while if you if you can do some kind of aggregate analysis.",
            "Then people won't object to that so much.",
            "Then to answer your question in this particular case.",
            "I don't know because I wasn't comparing what do I see in small samples.",
            "Right, so I don't.",
            "I mean, we see what we see in big network.",
            "What would I see in?",
            "I know some kind of smaller sample.",
            "I can't even say because I don't know how to get that smaller sample.",
            "Right, so I know if I would take one day of data or something like that.",
            "That could probably give me a smaller sample.",
            "So for that I don't.",
            "I don't have a good answer, but for example for this box, right I have a very good answer.",
            "What do you see when you look at small and what do you see when you look at large?",
            "Because I was actually comparing the two and I was surprised that they are.",
            "You see different things depending on what kind of network you take.",
            "OK. Yeah, question on that box should.",
            "So your NCP yeah?",
            "Is that new?",
            "People.",
            "I think there were, I think, the way we define them we're, I think we're the first to define them in that particular way, even though there were some similar things done before.",
            "But now I don't know.",
            "Connections were made to what does this mean for?",
            "Definition so you look out you can take subsets of size K, which is the best conductance you can get so that log.",
            "In operation, it might be interesting to look at.",
            "You might be interested in saying in looking at somehow you know how many.",
            "Where is are the separate office small?",
            "Anyway.",
            "We were thinking about it becausw exactly right now we're sort of plotting the conductance of the best piece right?",
            "Which is we are taking the extreme statistics in some sense, which is not satisfactory.",
            "So we were.",
            "But I was also doing.",
            "I would like maybe plot 90th percentile of of sort of taking away all the pieces.",
            "And I totally agree with you that the other problem we have right now is it's enough that there is a single piece there and the statistician will get the same plot, right?",
            "So we don't have any notion of how many pieces of that particular size.",
            "Are there we were thinking whether we could extend, but we we don't have anything yet on this.",
            "But I totally agree, yeah, you would like to know how good are the pieces and how many of them are there.",
            "The other thing is so if I start there are many like details here.",
            "So for example it also depends on what kind of pieces do you want to cut cut away.",
            "So for example it turns out that if you just care about conductance core then you will take you will start cutting away pieces that are disconnected.",
            "Right, so then you can start talking about how do you sort of regularize cuts, or how do you somehow force your cuts to be internally coherent.",
            "Which is sort of another completely different topic.",
            "So it turns out that if all you care about is optimizing conductance, then you will be cutting away several pieces and saying, oh, this is my cluster.",
            "Oh, the lower right box.",
            "So I was wondering, when you choose these, you have to create protection directly.",
            "At least connecting nodes.",
            "So one I was wondering is that even necessary to take those connecting the two?",
            "How sensitive is it to technique we use for choosing those?",
            "And I think so.",
            "The intuitively what we wanted was to choose sort of the fewest possible number of nodes to make the whole thing connected right?",
            "Sort of a Steiner tree problem, so we are using some heuristic to do that, so that's the first question.",
            "The second question is.",
            "In turn, I think we have experiments because we call one is called.",
            "The best thing to do to choose a minimum.",
            "By our choice or I don't know what, just that was that was that was sort of the the choice when creating these graphs by.",
            "I don't know I.",
            "So, so the second answer is, so we do we do this.",
            "The second answer is yes, we get significant.",
            "We get significant improvement because we call one projection and the other one connection because it's a connected projection graph and it helps becausw.",
            "Intuitively, it tells you how far away are things.",
            "It doesn't only tell you that things are disconnected, but it tells you are they like very far away?",
            "Or are they closer together.",
            "And given the sensitivity.",
            "We found these things to be quite stable actually because once you.",
            "Because the way we're doing it is some kind of sequential greedy way.",
            "We find sort of we go.",
            "We use the same node multiple times, so there are actually not so many competitors, so there are not too many different ways of doing it.",
            "And because we are just asking sort of, we hit the high degree connector nodes quickly and then either many pads go through them or they just go separately and that doesn't.",
            "And then if there are multiple separate pads because there is just one path, they don't make much difference in the in the graph itself.",
            "Question.",
            "All this work, I mean, it's it's a huge amount of work we've done.",
            "What would you say is the most significant use of machine learning?",
            "Huh, good, so I think where you can find the elements of machine learning is here for like fitting estimation, right?",
            "I think so here.",
            "The difference is that instead of comparing statistics, you are now comparing likelihoods.",
            "So it's again sort of a pinch of statistics.",
            "So yeah, I would say I would say most is here then maybe here, but this is more like application empirical.",
            "Yeah, I would say that works if I have to choose.",
            "So if I'm not sure people invoice but if not, then here's the Gump distribution for looping.",
            "20 27 would make sense.",
            "It's a week right?",
            "So so so.",
            "So it's email reminders.",
            "Also, there was a hard hard coded.",
            "Yeah, they they would like send you.",
            "You know this is the status so they have this sort of time points when they send and it's not time, but it's more like what level are you at.",
            "The question is.",
            "Milgram found 6.2 the six point 6.",
            "But the problem that ification with the diameter should be smaller but you.",
            "Home.",
            "That's a good point, even though.",
            "It's very different.",
            "It's like very different networks, right?",
            "So now we say we don't say as the network gets larger, so we say as the same network gets larger, diameter gets smaller, but we don't say you know, take any network of 100 nodes and now take some other network of 10,000,000 nodes that one of 10 million will have smaller diameter than the 100, right?",
            "So I think we're talking about two different networks here.",
            "Off who talks to whom, and write in Messenger for example.",
            "What is even surprising is maybe like we have this big holes in Africa right in Africa.",
            "Or you know, like you see people using Internet on like the Coast of Africa, but Central Africa is missing.",
            "So even like the question is, how well does this 6.6 correspond to real world?",
            "Because in one sense you could say oh you have these big holes in Africa so you have to go around Africa instead of getting through Africa.",
            "Right, so you could say you know.",
            "I mean there are like you could find reasons both for like saying in real world there should be a bit higher or saying in real world should be a bit lower.",
            "But I think what is interesting is that you know taking 4 million times more data or like 6 orders of magnitude more data.",
            "You're still around there.",
            "The picture there earlier work that found out that this is a counter implicit behavior.",
            "We want the library night that was affected by itself apart.",
            "Sure, that was that was deep, but they were using different measures, right?",
            "I mean, the question is, what do you plot?",
            "What kind of measure do you plot there and how do you find?",
            "How do you find it?",
            "And depression is also how much bias that you're getting from your clustering algorithm, right?",
            "And the difference, there was also that.",
            "I think that it was done by by section here.",
            "We're not cutting away anything.",
            "We always take the full network and we say what's the best cut of this size and then?",
            "Again, take the full network and say what's the best cut of this size so we never cut anything away.",
            "Right, because there it was made this so it was B section so it's not clear whether small pieces where do they come from, whether they come from 'cause when you do the half point cut you are like artificially creating these small pieces because you are cutting somewhere dense in the middle.",
            "The question will bring about litigation on the ferry.",
            "Set up the.",
            "Did not notice that there is a difference between the median and mean, so so I thought we need some process.",
            "We both agree this will settle the question if you plug the degree of the patterns for January 7th.",
            "Average average gross for sure, yeah.",

            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Vision yeah, do that, and definitely median is a good good good.",
            "It's a better choice than average.",
            "Sure.",
            "Social.",
            "And so I guess we can.",
            "We can go for questions for the audience, maybe a second round of the committee and then and then.",
            "Right so.",
            "For the left projection part, so other grant Rooster quality come from human capital exactly.",
            "So it's human judgments.",
            "So this was so this was done at Microsoft, right?",
            "So they have like for every query they have like 200 results and for each result they show it to a human and human has to assign from minus one to five.",
            "So what we were doing was given a set of results we were predicting what's the median score of the result in the set.",
            "So basically we're doing this set level predictions and we were also like doing not just how good is the query but also.",
            "How much spam is there and what the user will do next?",
            "So actually it's very nice because just from the structure of the graph you can say whether user will specialize or generalize a query so you can actually see that from how your results are connected.",
            "Sometimes from Batman human judgment, because I know that there are a lot of complaints about something.",
            "I wouldn't go that far.",
            "I would just say that that my algorithm can predict sort of quite accurately what humans will do.",
            "So you could use this for example, to spot water the queries your search engine is doing poorly on, or what are the hard queries and then go and investigate.",
            "So that's sort of the application of this.",
            "Can you suggest some URLs for the search engine to include in their circle?",
            "That's not so.",
            "I think what you could do is actually we went and we checked water disconnected nodes that we find that many times they were relevant.",
            "So one option would be to say oh, give a special consideration to these nodes that make your results connected.",
            "But but on the other hand our goal was not so much as as sort of as including something sort of doing cranking, meaning including new results as to say you know classifying queries or saying we're doing well on this queries, but we're doing poorly on these queries.",
            "Let's go investigate why.",
            "OK, sure.",

            "Sure, so you are asking whether whether, depending on the quality of the feet, I can find outliers.",
            "So I can definitely find like node outliers that are sticking out from for example, the feature distribution and what I see in real life.",
            "What what I was I haven't because ground that I was fitting where so.",
            "I was also trying to fit on like autonomous systems graphs and then I could for example see that sort of some graphs fitted better and some fitted fitted worse as the time went on so we could go and investigate.",

            "I mean, all all all all the intuitions that come, they say there is a sense that has lots of edges inside and the outside, right?",
            "And what is sort of the theory community?",
            "Or what is the most end, that measure or the most natural one is probably conducting, so just the ratio?",
            "What modularity does it?",
            "Does something very similar?",
            "Actually, it starts with exactly this intuition.",
            "But then he makes a twist and says, oh now let's compare it to the random graph, right?",
            "To sort of do a random graph it same degree distribution and then compare the number of edges inside.",
            "So what modularity does?",
            "It doesn't really tell you how many edges go to the outside, it just tells you how many edges are inside in comparison to this non model which.",
            "But starts with a different intuition.",
            "Starts with an intuition that are dense pieces sparsely connected to the outside, but then forgets to the boundary and just says, oh there are dense pieces.",
            "So.",
            "We decided to use this because we can't.",
            "It's more standard and more well understood.",
            "Also from the algorithmic algorithmic perspective.",
            "So I was just wondering about that diminishing returns thing.",
            "Did you find that for every example that you considered or where there's some some graphs that you looked at and we did find some kind of critical mass?",
            "So what we found is like for books, if you get more than three you don't like like it goes down.",
            "Even so, like just empirically right this adoption.",
            "So the question.",
            "So for example, for books.",
            "For DVDs we found this likeness diminishing returns for books.",
            "We found something that goes up and then goes down.",
            "So then the question is why books are different and we all the analysis.",
            "We found that sort of books are very different from like DVDs and music in terms of how people make recommendations, how eager they are to make them, and so on.",
            "So there are lots of material the statistical models in running graph.",
            "For example the exponential random graph model.",
            "So I'm just wondering if you are model Switch aiming at the real world datasets have some connection with this statistical work model or you make you some idea or something.",
            "So I think the the connection to exponential random graphs.",
            "I think there is a sort of a big difference, right?",
            "As firstly scalability, right?",
            "You can feed that 200 nodes and that's about it.",
            "Second one is sort of this disconnect that I was talking about before right?",
            "Exponential random graphs are very good at predicting single edges, but even like if you look at triangles, it turns out that they like to clump triangles into sort of just one part of the network, so they don't distribute triangles as they are in real networks.",
            "So if you are using exponential random graphs to generate net to generate the network, you will.",
            "At the end you will get something very different than what the real networks.",
            "So maybe individually you're sort of doing well, but as you put everything together and in the aggregate, you'll get something very different, so it's still a question how to put the two things together.",
            "Questions.",
            "So you can say that networks are sort of language to describe, denominated in nature, static networks, Skype, certain phenomenon.",
            "If you had to live if you stand in the language a little bit less if you have time, then we're able to discover a little bit more like in your example.",
            "So let's say if you ask you if you sent in the language even more than you would be able to discover even more complex than that.",
            "So let's say, can you comment on this for how?",
            "The area or how your work was going to future events in strengthening the language and discovering more complex phenomena.",
            "I think that's a good point actually.",
            "So for example, for this no communities, right?",
            "The question there is.",
            "For example, if I would have some kind of labels if I would know the type of the link, maybe I could find communities, cause some links are like friendship links and some other links are like work related links.",
            "So definitely adding more.",
            "Adding more data will help, so I would like to, yeah, it's sort of we started only by looking at topology, right?",
            "Like just how topology evolves and now we're adding, then we started adding time.",
            "We started getting cascade information so propagation information, so there are very natural steps of what to do next.",
            "What more information to include.",
            "So for example, some work we did on Messenger.",
            "We also had like user age and demographic information, so again you can try to start correlating those and so on.",
            "So I think it's very natural to use richer and richer networks as our understanding of them improves."
