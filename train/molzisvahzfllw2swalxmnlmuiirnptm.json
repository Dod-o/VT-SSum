            "So this event will take place once a day.",
            "This event might take take this, let's say once a week and then this says will have to be replenished eventually from below.",
            "So this event might take place once a month, for example, and this event might take this problem once, once a year, for example.",
            "So this is how it can be ensured that we can generate a continuously large number of cells, and yet the stem cells that are responsible for building this entire hierarchy go through a very small number of cell divisions.",
            "So now if we take the ratio of two.",
            "Adjacent.",
            "Differentiation rates, then we can introduce the amplification factor of gamma.",

            "That or not multiplied by gamma one gamma two will be the rate of this event, and so on.",
            "Alright, now this is an example.",
            "For such a hierarchy organization of the SAS.",
            "In our blood system, this is the hematopoietic system where indeed we have some long-term stem cells, which means that they divide very rarely.",
            "We have some short term stem cells, they divide, divide faster, then we have the multi potent cells and then even more differentiated and more differentiated cells, and these cells must divide faster and faster as we go down the hierarchy.",
            "I'm sorry this hierarchy is upside down compared to the one that I showed you.",
            "In my previous slide.",
            "Alright, so now.",
            "Let me define the microscopic events in such a hierarchical model.",
            "So differentiation can occur in two ways, either with a symmetric cell division with differentiation.",
            "Or and that can occur with probability pay key KPK at level K or with probability 1 -- P K there can be an asymmetric cell division.",
            "Now if we have some symmetric subdivisions, then some empty sides occur in level K and this empty site.",
            "Has to be replenished either by differentiation from below.",
            "With probability Q or with semantic subdivision in the same layer with probability 1 -- Q. SADF and single cell differentiation is now not taken into consideration only because those are sub optimal events.",
            "And now I'm interested in the optimal situation.",
            "We can also write up the the rates of these events, so if the differentiation rate is Delta then the rate of this kind of events is data divided by two becausw, two daughter cells.",
            "To differentiate it says.",
            "Are generated by such a single event, so data divided by two and multiplied by this ratio, this fraction B.",
            "Then the rate of the asymmetric cell division is data K * 1 -- P K. And if this is the rate at which the empty sides occur, then this rate is multiplied by QK to get the rate of the differentiation from below and then finally the same data divided by 2 * P is multiplied by 1 -- Q K to get the rate of this symmetric cell division without differentiation.",
            "Now we can plug all these rates.",
            "Into a formula I do not want to go into the details, but I just want to show you the result and the result is the following.",
            "That if we want to determine the length of the longest language in such a hierarchical issue, then the longest the longest lineage has this length, which depends only on the product of the amplification ratios and the sum of the amplification ratios and the number of hierarchical levels and the total number of says that we want to generate from a single stem cell.",
            "In our entire lifetime, so I showed you many microscopic parameters in the previous slide, but it turns out that the end result.",
            "So the length of the longest lineage does not depend at all on those microscopic events.",
            "Microscopic parameters.",
            "This divisional load or limit length depends only on these few parameters.",
            "So now if we.",
            "Fix the total number of sets that you want to generate and if we also fix the number of letters in the hierarchy, then we can minimize this function with respect to the amplification factors and then we get in the optimum.",
            "We get a uniform amplification factor, which is, which is this one, and if we plug this optimal.",
            "Value back to our formula.",
            "Then we will have the minimum.",
            "Divisional load for the minimum minimal length for the longest lineage as this formula.",
            "This is a really simple formula and now we can plot this formula here for a fixed number of total sales that we have to generate.",
            "For example in our in our skin example, we had to generate 3 * 10 to the eight says in our entire lifetime and now as a function of the number of hierarchical levels we can plot the length of the longest.",
            "Image and it's really interesting that this curve here goes very, very close to the absolute limit.",
            "The absolute lower limit, which is the limit that we get from a perfect binary tree.",
            "So if we had a perfect binary binary tree, then binary logarithm of N cell divisions would be enough to generate all these cells.",
            "And now if we have a sufficient number of hierarchical layers in our tissue, then we can have.",
            "Just.",
            "Two more sad divisions along even the longest lineages.",
