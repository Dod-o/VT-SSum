            "So I decided to take advantage of that.",
            "I come from industry and I myself has has has done the transfer from doing pure research to to industry research and from industry research too.",

            "So first, let's look at the the 30 years of PC or personal computing revolution, computing revolution.",
            "And that itself is a process of development hard nearing and that create intellectual property.",
            "Technologies, and then it's a it is coming to a adoptation adoption process.",
            "No, so those those technology then got to bring consumer benefit.",
            "So what I'm saying here is, you know for what we have seen today, the Revolution or the progression they progress we have done.",
            "We have seen in the last 30 some years are around.",
            "Personal computing is actually the process of technology development and adopt adoption process and so start from a PC when IBM.",

            "Will be sold separately from Howard so they said OK why don't we also see this little software to aces Startup Company as Microsoft so?",
            "They are so when they first come up with it, it's not a graphic interface, so all you can do is you do a spreadsheet and you do what processor?",
            "So, but that's compared to the mainframe is already a huge step forward to bring the PC into people's work workspace.",

            "And you have to think about long-term amounts of is a good example here is we, I think myself wondering is persistent is continue invest.",
            "You know, version one will not fly aversion to not fly versus three.",
            "OK, Windows 10 years.",
            "And for releases Office Word.",
            "11 years, 9 releases and Excel 10 years 5 releases.",
            "So it just look at long-term when you look at the product product pipeline today everybody everybody.",
            "Most people think Microsoft only have two part wrong.",
            "Can Microsoft get the Windows right at the office, right?",
            "Got Windows Server right?",
            "Gotta Xbox right and now I think we are.",

            "Search right.",
            "So they are, but you see it's it's one is consistent long-term investment and it's baking vessel.",
            "So today you also look at, you know, here on the left side you know Microsoft is in.",
            "It is investing in thermal vertical application areas, education, healthcare and.",
            "Core and technical computing and robotics and all those things.",
            "So.",
            "Another aspect you know we talk about, at least on the bottom money.",
            "A lot of investment and I know I I surprise this this this slide for you to ask for more money for multimedia research, and I, you know, I I should have put another number is.",
            "The the any revenue or the number of employees and to see to to show even more that is a company that Microsoft invest a lot on R&D and per I mean in terms of the total revenue percentage in terms of number of dollars per employee and.",
            "The company would argue there more innovative.",
            "And but it is on the on the side.",

            "Remember last year at White 09 for Microsoft fiscal Year start from July 1st?",
            "Basically for lot of white there and I was.",
            "July there, 2008 which is.",
            "That crap when the crisis started and we still put a 9.1 billion dollar into R&D and this year.",
            "Start from July this year weight is increased to 1.5 so it does require a lot of money.",
            "For company to continue.",
            "Lead in their own field.",
            "So the key point.",
            "I like to say you know any technology or knowledge transfer is hot and take time and of course to take along a lot of money.",
            "And thank God you to product and services.",
            "Is is is usually comes along way so.",
            "And those of you who you know.",
            "That was my work.",
            "You have to work, but I made myself aim is that video thumbnail, which I did.",
            "You know 17 years ago and sorry just to see how old I am.",
            "Finally, in the making into mainstream is in the in the Bing search engine and images similarity search and in search engine.",
            "So in terms of the Articuno mass market, the pervasive use you finally see the light of it.",
            "And although the technology itself has been here and there.",
            "Add method and they are the content based video editing.",
            "Yes we use some of that there and we use it in the Microsoft Media Center and other places.",
            "But really mass market daily use.",
            "Compass search engine.",
            "And there.",
            "The.",
            "There are.",
            "Also think about it.",
            "Take take a lot of time to find the right opportunity.",
            "Not not.",
            "Not to mention technology itself.",
            "Need time to mature and need a market to provide a lot of feedback.",
            "And another thing I would like to point out here and share with you the case.",
            "I think I'm qualified to say that because I consider myself as a researcher and download research and today I'm a AA executive.",
            "Really look at the bottom line on top line.",
            "The company that is you have anything came up.",
            "You have to make money for the company and so then I also run the incubation team and but my incubation team is very different from people in the University.",
            "They may think you know I have a technology like to look.",
            "Where can I use this technology?",
            "So you basically have a heart, have a hammer?",
            "You're looking for Neil and but in my case now I look at the what market?",
            "We want in two to three years.",
            "And then.",
            "Come back to see what technology that I can.",
            "Use in this three, 2, three years timeframe and then build a product or service felt in that intent at the starting point is very different from where I used to be and.",
            "It's a it's from market from consumer, so I'm not saying you should all go to marketing to do market study.",
            "My my point is you'll never underestimate the complexity of market.",
            "And I think it today.",
            "The talk we heard earlier on the year.",
            "Quality of experience is actually another reflection.",
            "If you have always think about using mathematical models to describe the signal to noise ratio.",
            "Work on the wrong target.",
            "Really, you want to raise the quality of experience.",
            "And is that just a few?",
            "Equations of numerical matrix.",
            "So also I think if you look at the success of iPod and.",
            "You, I mean people give a lot of credit to Apple.",
            "Say you know they are.",
            "Very innovative but MP3 player has been there.",
            "Much longer than iPod, and that's why you know, I I I. Apple was forced to pay 1 billion dollar to this small Singapore company called Creative Labs.",
            "And because they those are companies that really this, this is the company that really invented a lot of those MP MP3 players.",
            "But it is.",
            "The whole ecosystem is the iTunes.",
            "That's the system that made the iPod success.",
            "Successful, so that allowed to the iPhone 6S.",
            "So the success of a product or service.",
            "Is far beyond just enough.",
            "So I'd like to stop here.",
            "Thank you very much.",
            "Just remember this.",
            "If you have any questions reserved for the shooter, couple minutes.",
            "So I'm going to.",
            "I'm not going to be able to hold the so as long as you did, because I'm sure that you have the whole Microsoft activity.",
            "I have a much more modest.",
            "Sphere of activities.",
            "So I I will be.",
            "I will be much shorter too.",
            "First, yeah.",
            "What actually Alan asked us?"
        ],
        [
            "Not as wait as he he asked us a he pretended he did.",
            "He actually asked us two slides.",
            "And he said talk about needs, possibilities and bottlenecks, which is 3 topics.",
            "With emphasis on bottlenecks, so I try to manage Anna mixing a little bit Nissan bottlenecks and one slide and then possibilities, maybe 1 second and I do not definitely pretend that this is covering the whole area.",
            "I'm just looking at it from a very small or window.",
            "With narrow not very very narrow view.",
            "So what are the bottlenecks?",
            "In multimedia knowledge and technology transfer, I suppose by knowledge you also meant included, so I know that my good member here doesn't like Killer applications, but.",
            "Or maybe we don't agree on definition of killer applications, but I think that's really one of the reasons.",
            "This transfer of technology I know how into into industry and into market has been limited in multimedia has been in fact because there have not been enough killer applications or now actually you correctly mentioned that it's not because somebody put the technology that could store in MP3.",
            "Audio, it was actually because there was iPod, iPhone and iTunes together and a few other things that made actually the success.",
            "Of of Apple and I will I will call it like a good killer app.",
            "Although I fully agree also that that it's not the technology that made it a killer app, it was something else.",
            "A social media also, although it remains to be seen.",
            "Apparently Facebook and YouTube both now make money.",
            "But social media also, in my opinion is a good a good example.",
            "Maybe search also definitely one 3D cinema maybe?",
            "Surveillance also these are areas where we have potential or maybe have had already experienced some killer application.",
            "What we need more?",
            "We really need more now.",
            "Maybe people don't like killer application because maybe it's a little bit overwhelming and exaggerated.",
            "It doesn't kill anybody, yeah, or it doesn't kill any other applications, but.",
            "But we need more applications and we really don't.",
            "Maybe one of the reasons that is related to that, and this is my second point, is the lack of maturity of multimedia tools.",
            "It is true.",
            "It's a fact that multimedia by many, many measures is not mature enough.",
            "We heard Arnold.",
            "He mentioned 100 years before the between the.",
            "WhatsApp and pump and and the first locomotive.",
            "We are not 100 years yet through multimedia, so it needs a little bit more time to become mature, but.",
            "Let's not get this perceived.",
            "Lack of maturity.",
            "Stop us.",
            "From going to marketplace.",
            "A good example of that is Picasa by many many measures.",
            "The face detection that is used in Picasa.",
            "I'm not even sure if ACM Multimedia.",
            "If somebody had, you know, submitted a paper on the face detection that is on Picasa, ACM multimedia would have accepted it because it was maybe even rejected.",
            "We know don't know that right?",
            "Somebody has to trace it back.",
            "But Google Founders paper to cigar.",
            "That's another very good example.",
            "That's another good example.",
            "I didn't know about so, but but you know the bottom line is that.",
            "You don't have to wait until your technology, in your opinion, is perfect.",
            "For the same reason technology is not all, sometimes even less than mature technologies, in your opinion are very good.",
            "And very needed.",
            "To try it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "The last bottleneck I would like to talk about is is.",
            "Legal complexities that are around IP.",
            "In fact, one of the reasons probably that we haven't seen as much.",
            "Transfer of technology.",
            "Into the marketplace has been IPR and multimedia.",
            "It's a very special case because there are actually 3 type of legal and intellectual property problems.",
            "One is like anywhere else, it's the patents and licensing and things like that.",
            "The second one is that multimedia is about content, right?",
            "Media is content and content is not free as opposed to what?",
            "Many think and there are Copyright issues.",
            "There are ownership issues and this is that makes it even more complex than just technology, intellectual property and on top of that we are now witnessing a third problem in multimedia peering and this is the question of trust and the question of privacy.",
            "So there is a lot of you know issues that are preventing deployment of.",
            "Of the of the technologies and transfer of technologies, and they know how into marketplace.",
            "Only because of that.",
            "A lot of people of course, are enjoying this.",
            "More lawyers are having a great time.",
            "Maybe that, but you know.",
            "That's a side effect and.",
            "Nevertheless, this remains remains the bottleneck.",
            "Now, what are the possibilities to improve?",
            "Again, please have in mind I'm really talking from a very very narrow window, and definitely none of this is meant to be to be universally applicable.",
            "I believe that more and more we have the capability and we should have what people refer to as experimentally driven research in multimedia.",
            "And we had some good examples.",
            "Price by the way, by you with the two billion images.",
            "Well at least you have done 80 million.",
            "I'm, you know, and these kind of things should really happen more.",
            "All day to do it, but you're right, yeah, data driven.",
            "You call it yeah I called it experimentally driven, but it's definitely whatever they name the essences.",
            "You want to have it and actually you know it has.",
            "Two good.",
            "Outcomes if you do it, one is that it is going to identify actually what the real problems are.",
            "She will be astonished you will discover maybe the problem is not very.",
            "You think it?",
            "Is it somewhere else?",
            "It does give you even knew challenges to you or to others.",
            "And also it's always nice.",
            "It gives you visibility and a showcase right?",
            "How can you know if if you have 100,000 and million people using something you have developed and you are benefiting as you are designing it?",
            "From there you know, use and they are benefiting from you.",
            "What kind of better if you do a good job?",
            "Of course.",
            "What kind of better visibility would you would like to have this perfect?",
            "On the same.",
            "You know length, but but maybe it is much more.",
            "It's a limited way.",
            "I think that there are and there should be more and more evaluation campaigns.",
            "Actually, I have one disable this video clip 2010 so this kind of initiatives are very, very important, because these are basically what.",
            "Low US to do, you know, compare and and if it is done well to to move forward and benefit from different strengths of different players.",
            "And it is a technology transfer to.",

            "That is going to last.",
            "Much, much cheaper, but last much less so I can every month, let's say buy a new one for the same price, you know.",

            "Exactly, that's exactly what I'm getting at, right?",

            "First we have to have a certification.",
            "Somebody and authority says it's OK, and then we go out and buy it.",

            "Second, we need to understand what the level of the maturity is.",
            "I mean, I'm seeing similar to now talk about the multimedia community.",
            "So for example, when I see efforts that now revolve around track, weird, right?",
            "So it is excellent that record has provided common data and everyone can work on it.",

            "You could shoot it because it can always be implemented wrongly, so there is.",
            "There is the concept and and then you have to implement it the right way.",
            "And I wouldn't really mix, because standardization and certification are not the same.",

            "So let's not mix them.",

            "One way which is.",
            "I don't really even qualify that certification, but if you want it, it could have been indeed that social networks they take around, right?",
            "It's it's a way.",
            "It's a very loose way, not for my taste.",
            "It's called certification, but it's a way.",
            "Let's, let's say, for the purpose of discussion, that is, to it's a way of certification.",

            "Maybe it's a.",
            "It's a it's a better way of implementing it so.",
            "So let's not mix two things.",
            "One is the concept that you want to certify something.",
            "And you want to really have it.",

            "And this is fulfilling this, this, this this this certificates?",
            "They have received these certificates.",
            "Now how exactly the process of?",
            "Having this certificate is concerned it's a it's another debate.",

            "Definitely a process for that.",
            "As I said, you know I I don't personally think that the process of just having the into in the jungle and you know just it appears you know by itself, it's.",

            "Right, and so there is a little more added and so forth.",
            "Yes, so that's so.",
            "That's fine, but but all I'm saying though, is that you can still see papers being published where people are not necessarily using the latest data.",
            "So so so.",
            "So what I'm saying therefore is.",
            "That whenever you have this sort of her.",

            "I can point to very concrete instances.",

            "Do just.",
            "Directly attack track with or anything, but I will point out that.",
            "Depending on which part of the multimedia industry you are in track with, May or may not cover exactly what it is you're trying to do.",

            "So.",

            "And the the the the the real evaluation even further research should go before the open system or the.",
            "What is the?",

            "What are the part that are useful to take advantage of and what are the things that are less maybe efficiently done and maybe have another way of having it so so going back to the to the to the track we door.",
            "Any other evaluation campaign?",
            "I think each of them they serve a purpose.",
            "But beyond that purpose.",

            "You know, because not everything is also breakfast, right?",
            "So there are cases where you cannot do that right?",
            "And and in this case you know you did it again.",
            "You know another way.",
            "So I like the introduction of competition.",
            "So basically, what is a competition competition is that people agree to do research on the same data set.",
            "For that for for an instance on the same purpose.",
            "And if you look for instance at the tracking algorithms, I've been looking into lately that everybody carefully picks the algorithm it's suited for.",
            "Its so sorry, the data set to one data set, sometimes even two datasets.",
            "Or its own algorithm.",
            "So and even very serious journals except this practice.",
            "And there are in all the tracking papers, there are very, very few which explicitly name the limits of their algorithm.",
            "So then I prefer if that is the practice which was the practice, then I also in search, then I prefer competition because you agreed to do research on the same data set for the same purpose.",
            "But if you take that as a whole, but then I.",
            "Notice the door back in my research group that people start to focus on the result of the competition and they had this small margin of improvement over the other student and I completely lost the purpose of doing research, namely to understand why this is the case.",
            "So the Y has gone out of the window and the number improvement increases.",
            "Whereas so, but all of this that so by now, here's another advice.",
            "If you write a good white paper why it works or why it doesn't work, you get more attention than improving the incremental competition data, so to say.",
            "And to complete spectrum.",
            "That very few papers are hitting these days.",
            "All I've trained it on data set a of the BBC and I've applied it on CNN data.",
            "That was a real serious test.",
            "I know case probably knows from hard how many papers there are in this respect, but it is.",
            "But this is the real the real Sammy.",
            "Say me open, but sufficiently controllable that you can measure progress, so to say.",
            "I I I I'm 100% agree with you is we come back to the point that I was making on the impact standard.",
            "I think we even send that completely stopped after impact two.",
            "I think.",
            "I think everybody will say they downgrade job but they continued on the door.",
            "More research into it and started define impact 7 and they start even defined.",
            "How do you?",
            "How do you describe color histograms?",
            "And then we all know those things are not present.",
            "The novel present content well, so so you know it was in the very early stage of content within the retrieval why you want to put it another.",
            "So I think I think again, I'm not against the standard.",
            "What I'm saying is that you lossed direction.",
            "Really forgot what you started.",
            "So what's the original idea started with?",
            "So come back to generalize better, better than in the in the in the research community of people.",
            "Now you know trade the conference is a computation so so they they they start to think about the research is for the sake of publications.",
            "And that's where the danger come in.",
            "I think it's the same thing when when the impact community it just keep looking for what what next thing to standardize and so have the impact to that is that you end up four of them back four and even before intercourse closed and under any relocation they.",
            "Not at 7, and knowing that only the universities and research, research and communities is doing that.",
            "Really, before the things even came out of the batteries, you started standardizing and so today who's who knows what antisemitism is about and who use it.",
            "Because this is, this is a good debate and I think that we have to stop.",
            "Let me see.",
            "For the sake of also completeness, and I think that it's important to know so so you know there has been a lot of a lot of allegations about impact, whether it be good or not.",
            "Let me just tell you, I'm not a defendant, but you know, let me just set a few facts straight.",
            "A the most successful impact standard.",
            "Is MPEG 4 video.",
            "If you measure it in terms of codecs and stuff so you know, I think it's unfair to say.",
            "That after impact two, there hasn't been anything that has been good.",
            "And in fact, a number of respected companies on this panel.",
            "They are involved.",
            "If you are so so so strong.",
            "Opinionated about that.",
            "Convince your companies to stop contributing to it.",
            "Pick seven, however, that's correct, which is.",
            "I think it is.",
            "It's not a secret that then pick Seven has been.",
            "There has been a mistake whether.",
            "After that then pick 21 has been or not?",
            "Well Peter debate.",
