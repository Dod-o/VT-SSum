            "So this was Reid Anderson Fan, Chung Graham and Kevin Lang.",

            "But before I get to it, let me just explain what personalized page rank is so the page rank vector, the page rank distribution is related to a Markov chain on the nodes of the graph and so this Markov chain describes a process that.",
            "With probability Alpha follows a particular link in the graph, so it's a random surfer or random walk on top of the graph so it sits on nodes and then with probability Alpha it follows a link, so it moves two and two to an adjacent node.",
            "Alternatively, we have a probability of 1 minus Alpha of doing something else, and so from the perspective of personalized page rank, when you do something else, you're going to return to what I call a seed.",
            "So what a seed?",
            "The simplest case of the seed is just a single node you're interested in, so we'll see a couple of examples of seeding from this vertex.",
            "So if you seed from this this over text, you'll you'll restart.",
            "Their betaseed doesn't need to be just a single vertex, it could be a distribution over vertices.",
            "It could be a subset over vertices, it could be all sorts of different things, so this is oftentimes called a random surfer model.",
            "It's also called a random walk.",
            "With restart.",
            "The cool thing about this is regardless of your input graph, there exists a unique stationary distribution of this Markov chain, so.",
            "No matter how crazy the network you throw at me is, this thing always exists and is unique so everyone can always agree on it.",
            "So the idea here essentially is that if you actually compute a personalized Pagerank vector, so you look at the stationary distribution of this graph where you restart on this node, what you find is that with high probability, this random walk will stay in this group of nodes down here.",

            "It's 7 / 11.",
            "One way of interpreting this is it's the probability that a random walk leaves that set.",

            "I'm showing a demo here, here, here in Matlab.",
            "The only thing that exists in Matlab right now is just a pre cashed copy of the live Journal Graph.",
            "So this is a 5 million node 100 million edge graph.",
            "We're not going to start with that will get there in a second, but.",
            "Let's show how this algorithm works.",
            "So the first thing I'm going to do is show what this page rank algorithm does and how it behaves locally.",
            "So this is sort of an illustration of how the algorithm works.",
            "You'll see some pseudocode or you'll see some actual code in a second, but this is just a quick illustration, So what we're going to do is look at the behavior of this algorithm on that same graph, and what the way this procedure works is it stores for every node.",
            "Two different Val Val values.",
            "The current approximation of of the Pagerank vector is going to be indicated by the color of the node and then above each node is going to be a value that you should interpret as a residual.",
            "If you're a linear algebra test, you could also interpret interpret it as the amount of rank it has left to propagate to the rest of the network.",
            "If you're not a linear algebra.",
            "But what this algorithm does is it does a coordinate descent procedure on the linear system.",
            "Again, that's the sort of linear algebra procedure other if you don't like that, what it does is it squashes this rank and distributes it to all the neighbors of this graph.",
            "So when I squash this node, what happens is it distributes some amount of the mass that was here to the node.",
            "So this node went from black to red, and then it caused the residual on all of the adjacent nodes to a change.",
            "So every step of this method.",
            "Just touches all of the neighbors of the node, so then it picks another node.",
            "In this case it happens to pick the same node again and squashes it again and just keeps walking around the network squashing nodes.",
            "So how does it pick what nodes to ask?",
            "Wash?",
            "Well, it maintains a set of all the elements of the residual that are bigger than than some threshold that you pick, and so it picks anything that's not squashed enough and squashes it and just keep the distributed in rank all over the graph.",
            "Answer To couple steps of this method, you can see that it spends most of its time in that cluster, but it does jump out.",
            "And then it squashes a couple more so.",
            "Every step of this method just touches the neighbors of a node.",
            "You don't actually have to store these values for the vast majority of the graph 'cause they're going to stay zero throughout the entire run of the comp computation, so you can use a hash table or something to implicitly store all of the zeros.",
            "OK, so let's just run this a little bit more.",
            "So if I run it just a whole bunch more steps, you can now see it just wandering around the graph and spending most of its time there on that cluster that we're interested in.",
            "OK, what do you do next?",
            "Next you have to extract the community.",
            "So the way this works is here's the.",
            "Personalized Pagerank vector.",
            "After we've run it and the algorithm is finished with it, so the only nodes that ever touched in this graph were about this half of the graph here, so it never touched any of these nodes that aren't colored, and the way we do do the Community extraction is we just look at all of these nodes.",
            "Every node has a Pagerank value here and we sort the nodes by the the valve by their values in a related version of the stationary.",
            "Distribution page rank vector.",
            "Look at them in order and just compute the conductance of all of those sets.",
            "So at every step what we do is we add another vertex in an update our conductance.",
            "So here the conductance of the first set of justice single vertex was .8.",
            "If we add in this next one it goes down to .5 four.",
            "And what did we have to change their?",
            "Well we just had to adjust our estimate of the cut for these two edges here.",
            "So again every step along this way just touches those those neighbors.",
            "So these are very efficient.",
            "Operations and they are very easy to to update.",
            "So what happens is we do do all this for the entire vector.",
            "And then pick the best.",
            "So I think we're just about done.",
            "If you look at this, there was a set of conductance.",
            ".51 here and if I do this again, we can see what happens when that's actually .51.",

            "If the seeds of this procedure are in a set of good conductance, then the output from this procedure will find a set.",
            "Of almost as good conductance.",
            "So given any seed vector for this procedure, you're going to find a community that's almost as good as the best community that that node is in, or that set of seeds are in.",
            "OK, so the goal here is to find good seeds for four of this.",

            "So the thresholds are sort of how accurate our final vector is.",
            "So what I did was I just ran this 20 times on live Journal starting from this vertex here, and so we found a set of conductance .8 that's not particularly good, but we found that in .02 seconds so I can keep doing this all day, and periodically we find 1.",
            "Of good conductance.",
