            "It's kind of an all or nothing thing, and then we can evaluate it also continuously.",
            "So the idea is that sorry, the idea is that intuitively, if an alignment system misses a match that the experts had .9% point 9 confidence in that should be, you know, worse to miss that match then to miss one that they only had .51% confidence in.",
            "So we can have a metric that takes that into consideration, and this is described more in the paper.",

            "So like from .9 to 1.0, and that's all the confidence values that they're generating.",
            "Think if this were stressed more as a means of evaluating systems, we might see them developing ways to produce confidence values that more.",

            "And how well will those agree with with the experts?",
            "So I used Amazon's Mechanical Turk.",
            "I did this over Easter weekend, got my results in two days and spent $135.",

        ],
        [
            "So if we look at again, if we take the performance of the Mechanical Turk people and consider them in alignment system on the current version of the conference reference alignments, they would have an F measure of .90.",
            "And if you ever called the expert F measure was .89, so this is really similar performance.",
            "If we evaluate them against the discrete version of the expert generated alignment that measures .88.",
            "If we use a continuous version, it's .9 Seven.",
            "So the reason for this discrepancy is on the hardest of questions where there was the most discord.",
            "That was where Mechanical Turk in the experts disagreed the most, but the confidence the percentage of Turkers match very well with the percentage of experts that that agreed on these matches.",
            "And then finally this.",
            "This could be argued.",
            "This is a little bit misleading because these results include the 141 trivial matches and just assumed that everybody would always get those right if we leave those out and evaluate, we get an F measure of .91.",

            "I only ran into two people who are spammers, but I think that the reason that happened was because before I started this experiment, I got advice on a Mechanical Turk forum and then the lady who gave me advice got all of her friends to answer all my questions so they were really high quality users.",
