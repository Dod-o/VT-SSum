            "So let's start with the definition of psychedelics well.",
            "The best way to define them really as in terms of their their pharmacology.",
            "We can see three different psychedelic drugs.",
            "Here we've got Dimethyltryptamine in the top left corner.",
            "There we have LSD, semi synthetic compound derived from a fungus that grows on Rye grass and we have Silas in the bottom left corner.",
            "That's the active metabolite of psilocybin, which is a compound found in magic mushrooms.",

            "The naturally occurring neurotransmitter neuromodulator, serotonin so you know if we look at DMT, for example Dimethyltryptamine.",
            "It's remarkably similar, so just a subtle alteration in the molecular structure here.",

            "So what do we know about the pharmacology of psychedelic drugs?",
            "Well, a milestone discovery occurred in the mid 1980s when Richard Glennon found that there is a strong positive correlation between psychedelic drugs.",
            "Affinity for a particular serotonin receptor, the serotonin 2A receptor.",
            "And their potency.",
            "So the higher the affinity, so the stickier the compound, the more potent it isn't.",
            "To help illustrate that, LSD is a good example, because it is has a very high affinity for the serotonin 2A receptor acting as a as an agonist, or really partial agonist, and it's incredibly potent, so it's psychoactive in doses as low as 20 micrograms, which is.",
            "Pretty pretty remarkable really, is one of the most potent psychoactive drugs that there is.",
            "Now if we look at #2, there further evidence for the importance of the serotonin 2A receptor was found by Franz Vollenweider in Switzerland and his team, and he showed that if you block the serotonin 2A receptor will be at non selectively with a serotonin 2A receptor antagonist or blocker kit answer in then you will significantly attenuate the characteristic psychedelic or hallucinogen IK.",
            "If you want affects of.",
            "Psilocybe and incidentally, they've more recently shown that the positive mood effects of Psilocybe in are also significantly attenuated by pretreatment with Kate answering.",
            "So there's two A receptors clearly important for the characteristic psychedelic effects of psychedelic drugs, but also their potential positive mood effects, which is interesting and will come on to that later.",
            "In the context of therapeutic potential, therapeutic applications of psychedelics.",
            "So you want to know where are these serotonin 2A receptors?",
            "Well, pet imaging shown that they are very heavily expressed in the cortex, much lower expression in subcortical regions and a relatively homogeneous distribution in the cortex, particularly high actually in the visual cortex and also in high level associative cortex as well.",
            "So if.",
            "If we think of the brain in a hierarchical way, then they're being expressed in the higher level regions of the cortex.",
            "What about the the lamina distribution of serotonin 2A receptors?",
            "Well again there are there expressed that if we think of of the the cortical layers in a hierarchical way, then there being expressed on on the higher level cells in the cortex and those are the serotonin rather there.",
            "Those are the layer 5 parameter neurons.",
            "It is very high and reliable expression on layer 5 parameter neurons essentially all more or less all.",
            "Lefi parameter neurons express the serotonin 2A receptor.",

            "And So what are these psychological effects well?",
            "They have, as I've said, these these drugs have profound effects on consciousness.",
            "They they alter consciousness in a in a dramatic and novel way.",
            "And these effects also seem to be in during in some respects in terms of alterations in personality, so some particularly important studies were carried out at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and a particular study found that people naive to psychedelics.",
            "I've never taken a psychedelic drug before they were administered psilocybe in a single dose or high dose 30 milligrams.",
            "And.",
            "A large proportion of these volunteers rated their experience with psilocybin as among the most personally meaningful of the whole of their lives.",
            "So when they were encouraged to put that into context, they would say it's up there with things like the birth of their first child or or the death of a important family member.",
            "So clearly they had very profound experiences.",
            "Now they also found that these effects were in during so.",
            "When they followed up the volunteers over a year on a large proportion was still maintaining.",
            "That's their single experience with Psilocybe and remained among the top five most meaningful experiences of the whole of their lives.",
            "The study team also found that volunteers well being reports of well being were increased, so increased well being after after this single experience with Psilocybe.",
            "And that was again over a year on from from the experience itself, some 79% and incidentally there weren't any reports of any decreases in well being in these psychedelic naive volunteers after their single experience with Psilocybe in.",
            "Also interesting, the researchers looked at personality using the neopia, the classic personality inventory with the big the Big 5.",
            "It's referred to as.",
            "Five traits and one particular trait trait openness was significantly increased over a year on again from just this one experience with Silas Ivan.",
            "So that's quite remarkable because personality should remain stable in adulthood.",
            "There's good evidence that it's it's.",
            "It's a stable phenomenon, and the new API, for example, has high test retest reliability in adults, so this is unusual and it's interesting people are changing their not just having profound experiences, but they're also changing in some respects.",
            "So what about the the application of these drugs?",
            "It's all you know, good and well to study their psychology with A view to understanding consciousness, for example.",
            "But perhaps more importantly, how can they be applied?",
            "How can they be made use of, and so an increasing number of studies are being published showing quite impressive therapeutic potential with psychedelic drugs?",
            "And I've cited just a few of these so.",

            "Also decreased drinking behaviors at nine months after psylocybe and treatment again.",

            "But if you sample a large population, as these researchers have done, then you actually find the opposite of what most people's assumptions might be.",

            "With some improvements in mental health and psychological well being incidentally, this trend was specific to psychedelics.",

            "What about animal research?",

            "So repeating behaviors you could think of that as kind of cognitive and behavioral inflexibility.",
            "Now LSD and also other serotonin 2A receptor agonist.",
            "Have been linked to increases in cognitive flexibility and also low level learning, so associative learning has been found to be enhanced by LSD, so that's interesting and it leads one to think you know what are the mechanisms so people have looked at PDF expression and other markers of neuroplasticity with serotonin 2A receptor agonist and have found a one study found a doubling of BDF expression specifically in the cortex with a serotonin 2A receptor.",
            "Agonist that's not true in the hippocampus, so there's this interesting discrepancy between what you see in the hippocampus and the cortex, but nevertheless there is a increase in markers of plasticity, particularly in the cortex with psychedelic drugs, which is where these serotonin 2A receptors are most heavily expressed."
