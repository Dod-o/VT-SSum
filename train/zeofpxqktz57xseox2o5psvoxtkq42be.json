            "I must say lots of people were on their way to attend reveal.",
            "Probably I would like to get feedback on that and there will be another one tonight.",
            "So one of the things that we somehow was talking about was to get more industry people involved.",
            "So this is one way.",
            "So we tried that.",
            "Can we please, you know, send your comments or tell us what you think on that.",
            "We also introduced the sort of nights and weekends version of registration.",
            "First time we've departed from the all inclusive so someone could come to the tutorials and workshops and the evening sessions along with the very valuable poster sessions as well as order so that option was signed up for by 80 or 90 people here and in a city with a large industry population you could go to work.",
            "And then come to the conference as a new way to try it out.",
            "So we're going to hopefully that will do well in Washington, where there's a huge number of people that might appeal to, and so hopefully next year that will.",
            "That will get a try again, but we'd love your feedback.",
            "There was a question, yeah?",
            "What wait a second, we just think excellent.",
            "Two days, I'm not just blaming Conference 70 short.",
            "Yeah, that's the 2 1/2 days too short of just a conference that's the ever growing debate of.",
            "I think it's sort of convergence over the last 15 years of deciding on that on that length.",
            "Should we do a poor instance?",
            "Paul Gregory.",
            "You're the master.",
            "I think.",
            "Well, we can do it, but I agree that it's it's too short.",
            "The problem is that three days is too long, so we've tried different versions and many people say that they cannot go to three day conference is doing 1/2 days was designed so that people could live on Wednesday.",
            "The other question was why does a conference start on Sunday?",
            "It's not not because you know the organizers said Jewish and they don't work on Saturday.",
            "I think this torical reason that many, many years ago in the last Millennium in the US, The airlines had a discount refused fly Saturday night.",
            "So that's why this whole thing started.",
            "Now it's no longer relevant.",
            "It's possible to consider conference that doesn't start on Sunday, but you know, have some other options.",
            "But I think you know, having cloned the conference will have equal number of peoples unhappy, but actually, I mean we might as well.",
            "Run, run the poll.",
            "If anybody think that the conference should go longer than 2 1/2 days.",
            "Anyone think that it's right at 2 1/2 days?",
            "Anyone think it should be shorter?",
            "OK yeah, they're gone by now, so it's a biased.",
            "Are there other questions or suggestions or things we can do for the field?",
            "Yeah please.",
            "Microphone on the way.",
            "So there are several research problems that can only benefit.",
            "One can do experiments on life graphic, then that is something which is not available negatively.",
            "On the other hand, there is a section in the news right now that says whether or experimenting, predictable or not ever.",
            "That kind of person just feel research.",
            "It's not possible to provide details that could be produced such scenarios, so I got the solution to that, but.",
            "Yeah, access to datasets that are particularly hard to have access at in.",
            "In academia in particular, and sort of maybe have a way for the conference to provide these.",
            "Live.",
            "Or more alive data, set large datasets for publicity yeah.",
            "Peacock this absolute more presence inside console.",

            "Or basic.",
            "Electorial great great suggestion on featuring KDD, more prominently inside the conference itself.",
            "The Kennedy Cup.",
            "Sort of has been taken this approach that we're trying to do is publish your data set and for science to go forward.",
            "Repeat ability is completely different than publish all your data, so it could just be as simple as asking for commitments you say you know.",
            "If you have a private data set to work with, another author wants to re code and run over your data set privately and integrate with that version 10 weeks for repeat ability that could be exploited there.",
            "Yeah, I mean.",
            "A way to do this also is we don't necessarily have to force people to publish their datasets, but we can encourage it by at least having the infrastructure and the services to enable it to begin with, and then sort of graduate to the next level.",
            "Last question or suggestion before we run out of time before.",
            "Oh OK. Yanga board.",
            "Only invited speakers.",
            "I think it's a hit this time from year to year, so just want to mention that wants to really stay on the importance that having really, really, really good keynotes.",
            "It's 1 kilos created tables with it all worked out for coming over, so I'd like to emphasize the organizing communities with huge investment, huge effort into scrutinizing the speakers.",
            "I have to check out their slides before they come.",
            "You know Yang?",
            "Did you have any particular speakers in mind?",
            "Suggestions to the chair.",
            "OK, last question, my keyboard.",
            "Take ownership of their concept around Eagle Mountain.",
            "For example, I want to find a classic paper on Association books and every Wikipedia about that.",
            "I'm not even my regret asking so we could begin the begin morning looking very nice and get the key concepts and then put the.",
            "Classroom, September Howard Publishing was all these papers for conferences, but there will be other information is lost in paper PDF files.",
            "So you mean like heatmaps of topics or?",
            "You up for demining would be run by switching the for each of those things you have the classic papers.",
            "I agree with that.",
            "Actually, exposure and Wikipedia is huge to also get visibility in search engines, so we have done a poor job.",
            "Excellent suggestion.",
            "OK, I'd like to thank you all for attending the lunch and for your suggestions.",
            "And please email suggestions if you have him afterwards.",
