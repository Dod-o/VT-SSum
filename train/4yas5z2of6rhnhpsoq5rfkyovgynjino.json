            "I was researching historical vocabulary of jazz, but I found sentences with no dates, no sources, just crawled in 2018.",
            "And for this questions it's difficult when no metadata are available.",
            "The second question, where did those lexicographers get their information from and the third one is if you have material from Colunga.",

            "So you will have a date and you will have the URL where the sentence came from.",
            "Most times this is all we can provide, but yeah, this will be there so.",
            "For the.",
            "Google search strategy.",
            "And yeah, we we really tried that.",
            "So this is yeah, this bootstrap approach also used in foods like boot kit for example is a very promising approach, but we found it very difficult for lesser resourced languages typically.",
            "So you query a few of the words of the language you found in text, send that to the search engine and hope to get back.",
            "The documents containing the language, but what we learned was typically that there will be other documents very often which are ranked higher by Google and which either by mistake by pure coincidence or by citing the language rank much more higher because there are, for example, in English language.",
            "And then yeah, Google rank some very higher because they probably have a higher page rank.",
            "Are much better linked in the net and we really had difficulties to get good results or results at all.",
            "For smaller languages, what was the second question?",
