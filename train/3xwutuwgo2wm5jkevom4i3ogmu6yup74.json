            "About soccer into this system and the system then was.",

            "This is really it's a web service.",
            "So the what we're looking here just for humans.",

            "Or what's the ID?",
            "And while the system tries to perform also disambiguation?",
            "So let's say Brazil has many meanings.",

            "Also with the name Brazil movie is called Brazilian so on.",

            "So this one and this is the country in this particular case.",
            "So this is this is introducing a little bit more powerful representation into text itself.",
            "Um?",
            "Up OK, so this is.",

            "Something more sophisticated, so now I'm showing the.",

            "We put the search.",
            "And.",

            "Small piece of text which kind of summarizes the contents.",
            "So this summary was generated automatically here on the right side you have such points, so we will use it where you can move this to particular topic and you will get Articles Re ranked and also the summary will get reformulated.",
            "Then here we have geographical map.",
            "We can say well show me what?",
            "Is being published from particular site of type of the worlds and here we have also sent him and show me just negative news or show me just positive news.",
            "Now let's let's move this dot.",
            "So this Microsoft topics would be one of the topics is about Microsoft Surface.",

            "Internet will work so this.",

            "Yeah, I see results got re ranked and now summaries getting calculated and this is the summary of Microsoft Surface articles.",
            "If we say show me just what's being written.",
            "Inlets in Europe.",
            "OK. Now we get just European news you see from UK and couple of others and also it's appropriate summary if we say show me just the negative news about about Microsoft Surface being published in Europe then.",
            "We put the negative so now the negative news would come up on surface and also the summary would get.",
            "Adjust it.",
            "So this is 1 demo which uses now many elements or some elements which.",
            "Link data only people positive.",
            "No, this is not a.",
            "These are just news articles from last year.",

            "Performer offline and how much is performance?",
            "So.",
            "If you want to reorder the collection.",
            "So the current version of the system works on the live feed, so like a few articles per second comes on, the input gets are put.",
            "All the articles are put into enricher, the system which you saw before.",
            "So we get all this structure out.",
            "And so all these three ranking and stuff happens online, so it's real time or semi business real time.",
            "So it's maybe deley.",
            "Forget what?",
            "Yeah, so here currently.",
            "Yeah, in the in the system which leaves on the live feed will be probably will be some like maybe a few weeks of news.",
            "I think currently parameter we have like maybe one month or two months, yeah?",
            "Yeah, so so this is the current iPad app operates like this, But this is really just a parameter.",
            "It's really just a parameter.",
            "So because sometimes you wouldn't want to see the old particles, yeah?",
            "How do you?",
            "How do you guarantee that the news about Microsoft Surface is diverse if you don't get the same article in different newspapers of what we do?",
            "So we crawl.",
            "So this is another system.",
            "Oh it's called news feeds.",
            "So this is a system which is again it's a web service which you can use.",
            "So this is the visual demo.",
            "Basically this crawls.",
            "Here we have.",
            "Oh, we have like 40,000 mainstream news for each source.",
            "We know the location where it's coming from.",
            "Genre and so on.",
            "Then we have 250,000 blocks active blocks, also with some metadata.",
            "Now I see.",
            "So now it's the network is a little bit slow, but somehow here you would see how news are coming into the system and then if if the new story has some kind of location information then we place it also on the on the on the map.",
            "But generally it's on average would be.",
            "Fuel, fuel, fuel fuel use items per second would come in.",
            "Yeah.",
            "If there is any information about the location in the news, you use it, otherwise you don't.",
            "Kind of entity.",
            "Recognition like location.",
            "So whenever we talk about geography, there are two aspects, either from there the information is being published about, so where the publisher is coming from.",
            "Let's say if it's New York Times, it's New York.",
            "If it's Guardian would be London and so on.",
            "Kalamaki news, I'm sure it exists would be from here.",
            "So so information about publisher.",
            "So this is from where the information is being published and about which locations the information actually talks.",
            "So there both aspects.",
            "Here we use just the.",
            "Oh, I think very is being published from the Dutch and Spain and so on.",
            "Yeah, but this is the other aspect is about which location.",
            "So this is another demo which is kind of related and now I'm just trying to put bit by bit into more complex 5 minutes only.",
            "So this is a.",
            "This one is also part of the.",
            "Projects called acts like here.",
            "We want to concentrate on events so the idea is the following.",
            "Are the.",
            "The idea is the following.",
            "So we get news and we would want to identify events and what publishers don't have.",
            "And this is actually requirement which came from in this case from New York Times people.",
            "They said OK, we have all these ontologies and taxonomies and registries which have all nice entities nicely labeled, but we don't.",
            "We don't have registry or taxonomy of events and so this is now the.",
            "Kind of testing testing system prototype system which would have registry of events where each event would get get its own ID with together with its description so.",
            "So this is still just prototype, but works nicely, so let's put.",
            "So.",
            "Chicago.",
            "So Chicago means many things.",
            "Let's say we can say just Chicago Bulls show me results about Chicago Bulls.",
            "We say search.",
            "So and so.",
            "Sorry.",
            "Yeah yeah, yeah.",
            "Not of some kind, that's important, yeah?",
            "Yeah, Chicago Bulls you don't know about Chicago Bulls you they used to win NBA year by year now then there's still NBA.",
            "Michael Jordan, yeah.",
            "Uh.",
            "So let me think it came results came already.",
            "Yeah so.",
            "We found 84 events related to Chicago Bulls, so let's say this is the first event, 2nd event and so on.",
            "OK, let's check about events.",
            "So the idea is also since I mentioned before the crossing reality, so events could be described in many languages.",
            "Currently the this version works only per language, but in the next month or two we will have coverage.",
            "So events will be identified from roughly 50 languages, so so.",
            "Oh, so there's a an event which probably is no point of no particular relevance for us, But for this Chicago people, when I was showing there for the move was a big thing, you know things like this.",
            "So one guy was fined with $35,000.",
            "And now we press this.",
            "And we would get description of events and all the corresponding.",
            "Oh articles.",
            "So this is the title.",
            "This is the well here.",
            "We have eleven articles for this event.",
            "This is description from the center it from the central article on it.",
            "These are the entities.",
            "Describing that particular event and on the right side we have also the and.",
            "Here we have keywords, keywords which are so entities come from Wikipedia and a couple of other registries keywords are more like free free keywords and these are articles.",
            "So if we click one we would get texts.",
            "And we can browse.",
            "So for instance here now you see we are adding more and more.",
            "Information and in the whole thing, and we can obviously come with more sophisticated services.",
            "So I have plenty of demo said, but John is trying to say that it sent yeah, but please question.",
            "Yep.",
            "Do you have any mechanism to put this twice a month?",
            "I see, yeah, so actually this is meant to be the same article at the same, see because it's it's an event which is described by several publishers, Miami Herald and so this is national Public Radio and basically we get all these articles into our feet and then we try to squeeze all the all the articles which talk about the same event into the same events.",
            "And I mean.",
            "Here I'm showing the event, not the event list.",
            "So this is the events on the previous screen you saw.",
            "Oh so these are different events or.",
            "So anyway, so.",
            "That is the whole point of event register that everything was related to a particular event.",
            "It's clustered thrown images, articles in one or the other languages and so on, yeah?",
            "Or you can find.",
            "An event.",
            "Yeah, so so in the way.",
            "You set event if we looking for any kind of place in the web.",
            "So we we have this few 100,000 RSS feeds which have some relevance and we crawl this RSS feeds and this is the source so we don't go to.",
            "I don't know some search engine and crawled stuff randomly so we get information from feats and we post process this fits.",
            "So this is the way how it's being done.",
            "And our machine machine everything is automatic here, so description of event this is very relevant question.",
            "What is an event so the way how we try to define event here is something which has same topicality, sound the same topic and also the same social parts of the same name.",
            "Entities would appear, let's say earthquake can be here and there.",
            "But earthquake and the third dimension is that time, time, time, social content.",
            "So these are three dimensions.",
            "And this is scalable.",
            "And it works pretty well.",
            "So what we are adding now is also hierarchy of events so that we can.",
            "So you have.",
            "I don't know war in Iraq or as I'm bombing in Iraq, but this is part of bigger bigger story which is war in Iraq and also the timeline.",
            "So the sequences of events which are connected.",
            "So this will be also added.",
            "Did you say that?",
            "We can do next.",
            "That's appearing.",
            "Subway is stupid.",
            "I mean.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Hello.",
            "So if I understand the question right, so here what we do, so we use this in richer which I showed in the previous stage.",
            "The to preprocess the documents and so this is more like I would say lightweight semantics so we recognize them entities.",
            "Name entities have links to let's say DB Pedia and other places.",
            "And this is the level of semantic.",
            "So what Giannis is doing for instance now is also relationship extraction.",
            "So how to extract relationship between entities?",
            "But this is not part of this system yet, so eventually we would like also to understand at least for some domains in what relationships.",
            "Entities copier let's say for business documents this would have sense and for some typical topics, but there might be topics which are more harder actually.",
            "But yeah, relationship extraction is also one of the topics which eventually will get covered since we try to be cross lingual then this adds a little bit more complexity to the whole thing.",
            "Yep.",
            "Yeah, we have already working system.",
            "It's not good in that enough yet so that we would expose it here.",
            "But so basically what we do is so as long as the feed is coming in so we are maintaining the taxonomy of topics and from very particular one to the higher level ones.",
            "Now here this is more like clustering works by itself, so Dimas is not good for labeling events when you can label any document with this, but event, like Iraqi War, it's not in demos, it doesn't exist.",
            "From from the well.",
            "Yeah, from the news and then using hierarchical clustering, we identified the taxonomy.",
            "Yeah because.",
            "These are so you wouldn't have a place on the web where somebody would tell you how hard this is.",
            "The the abstraction of particular event stories you need to identify it by by itself automatically.",
            "I have many more demos, but I'm brutally.",
            "OK.",
            "So thank you very much, thanks."
