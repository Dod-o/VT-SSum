        [
            "There's also some reasons why newspapers can actually be a pretty terrible source to work with.",
            "It's a little bit less I could think of more baby, but I don't want it to be too scary.",
            "But if you want to work with the text, you can expect, at least currently, that the text quality is usually.",

            "We did some performance evaluation we found with the technology we've been using back then, we could detect about 70 to 80% of the words correctly.",
            "So that means if you're doing text analysis, you have to be very careful that there is a lot of error in the words and you have to somehow think about how that influences your research or how your method can actually deal with such defects.",
            "Another thing that is an artifact of digitisation is that in the newspapers you have these different articles and one important step in the digitization is to do layout analysis and separate these articles and that sometimes can go wrong.",

            "So yeah, just to emphasize this is from talk I gave with a colleague at the age conference in 2012, so this is already seven years ago.",
            "But back then we did had the European newspaper project, and in the project Archive we assembled something like about 12,000,000 pages of newspapers from all over Europe, which we thought was pretty much so at the time it was the biggest collection of digitized newspapers from Europe available online.",
            "And we did a survey to find out how much newspaper pages were already digitized in libraries, and that's the second column here.",

            "So that's also something to be aware of, and there was a study here from disk on academic service in the UK.",
            "If you continue to digitize at the current pace, it will take us another 1800 years to complete the digitalization of our newspapers.",

            "This is done as well.",
            "So the first thing they do they start with ironing the newspapers.",
            "So of course, these historical newspapers newspapers were not printed on very valuable paper.",
            "It was a resource that people used for a day and then it was thrown away.",
            "So it was not very much invested into the paper or the ink.",
            "So you see a lot of deterioration of that and that of course can also impact the quality of the digitalization.",
            "And then you typically you have two ways to do this.",
            "Um, since newspapers in the past have very often been already microfilmed, I know if any of you have already worked with a microfilm viewer, it's very old fashioned, but this was the standard way to work with newspapers in the past in the library, so this was done, of course, for preservation.",
            "And the nice thing is, when you do this digitalization, now that's in the middle picture with a microfilm scanner you just enter, you put in the film.",
            "And then it just runs through automatically and then you have usually within a few hours you have digitized the whole year of 1 newspaper.",
            "That's of course very efficient compared to what you see in right bottom picture.",
            "The classic way of digitizing from paper original where you have big overhead scanners and then you have to turn every single page and flatten it.",
            "And of course it takes a lot more time, so usually the quality of the microfilm is not so good like the paper original, so the quality of the digitization is also a little bit worse.",
            "But at the same time, you can do much more in much quicker time and with less money.",
            "So these are two ways we use both.",
            "We decide, usually based on the quality of the microfilm, whether we do that, or whether we take the paper original.",
            "But of course it also has a bit of an influence on the data that is becoming available and how."
        ],
        [
            "So yeah, this was I said the first thing.",
            "Then when you have scans, the image of the pages that you do, layout analysis and this is already still one of the fields where a lot of research is currently happening in computer science and computer vision.",
            "And this is a very challenging task, so you try to hear this is actually a fairly simple example but just two columns.",
            "You will see newspapers can have as much as.",
            "56 columns and then you have a mix, for example of big headlines, an maybe an image and then the text beneath.",
            "And it's very challenging for the computer to determine what elements belong together and what form one content unit.",
            "So usually you start first by detecting these columns.",
            "Then the columns are grouped and you try to identify what you see here in the third picture on the top where the headlines are, so where knew.",
            "Article, for example, starts and then the most challenging finger that sometimes even we humans we cannot decide is to determine something like a reading order.",
            "So that's what you see in the in F in the bottom column and on the right.",
            "So where you start, for example at the top left and then you continue in some direction.",
            "This is as I said, a fairly simple example.",
            "Of course sometimes you can also have these.",
            "Articles where you have say a teaser on the first page and then it says.",
            "Continue on page 5.",
            "So this is quite difficult to model that of course in the digital, so you need to detect that you need to provide a link.",
            "You need to find the correct place.",
            "Then on that page to link to let's all very challenging, and so usually in the past, since this has been not been possible to do very well in an automated way.",
            "It was a lot of user correction when this was done, which means usually the cost for digitising a page with articles separation is about 6 times the cost.",
            "If you don't do it.",
            "So a lot of the collections you see they won't have this article separation, they will just have text and then it's basically a bit of a question of luck whether the sequence of the text is correct.",

            "That's an XML format.",
            "Standards are maintained by the Library of Congress, where you have different sections, where then you can provide references to the actual images or text and to provide a bit of a skeleton of the of the organization of a document that.",

        [
            "Well, next thing, of course, once you have determined the layout is you want to do the text recognition, the optical text recognition, OCR and as I've said, it's usually the quality of the paper, the quality of the ink is pretty bad.",
            "Then sometimes I think this is an example here from the British newspaper Archive that was done from microfilm.",
            "You will see also for yourself.",
            "It will be very difficult to determine here on the top.",
            "Actually what is the text here and you see the results on the left hand side of what's the?",
            "The computer, the software, so to say, determined the text to be and it has a lots of errors in it.",
            "So there was a study also that I recommend.",
            "It's also the link here is in the slides by Simon tenor, analyzing the quality of OCR in the British newspaper Archive and they found you can see it.",
            "Of course it varies a lot, but there are some interesting things to look at.",
            "For example, usually optical character recognition uses character accuracy for evaluation, so it means how many characters are correct on a page.",
            "But this is not very useful for end users who want to analyze who want to read these texts.",
            "You're much more interested in how many words are correct.",

            "You're looking for a particular information.",
            "So the good thing is if you look at significant words, so excluding for example stop words like articles or words like end or those are usually much better recognize.",

            "Usually the much better is recognized because then there is more context for the software.",
