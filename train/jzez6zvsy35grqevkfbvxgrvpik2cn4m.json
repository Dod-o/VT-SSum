            "I personally work on a lot to change that.",

            "Semantics contained data directly encoded for human perception, and that will be audio, images, video touch and its associated meta data, and natural text or computer encoded data.",
            "So the point here is what's interesting about this is that if you have web pages and they are encoded in text in HTML and so on, it means you already encoding something.",
