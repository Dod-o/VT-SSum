            "So what do we do in our lab?",

            "One is actually to introduce new genomic methods into the diagnosis of rare congenital disorders and not say a few things about the clinical applications of these techniques in the past has been comparative genomic hybridization microarrays.",
            "And now it's next Gen sequencing in particular exome sequencing and I'll try to justify why.",
            "We work on the rare congenital disorders, in fact, 'cause you could actually ask the question.",
            "Is this an interesting field?",
            "I mean, you'll save a lot more lives if you solve cancer than if you work on these diseases where only 100,000 people are affected by those diseases and I'll come back to that in a moment.",
            "So one part of the work is really focusing on clinical applications in building prototypes that are about to enter routine clinical applications, and this area has been really an area where our mix technology so CGH arrays in particular, and now exome sequencing.",
            "Have been making a huge difference, so this being the kind of killer applications for these genomic techniques, this field has been truly revolutionized by first CGH arrays and now exome sequencing, so next to the diagnostic work.",
            "We do another thing and that's going to be the focus of this talk, which is that when we collect patients, so basically we collect patients mostly in the past with deletions and duplications in the genome an in.",
            "That way we can take patients that show similar disease symptoms and group them together and realize that there is a bunch of patients sharing similar symptoms that actually have anomalies in same regions of the genome.",
            "OK, so basically this is 1 technique that will actually I'm sorry.",
            "That will deliver here patients that have related aberrations.",
            "Let's say it's deletions in some part of the genome and they have a bunch of phenotypes that are actually are quite overlapping OK, and so you can actually refine this.",
            "So for example, you can see very well, but somewhere there's seizures three out of the four patients have seizures, and actually these three patients share this small region that the 4th patient doesn't have.",

            "Sorry, is a containing a gene that causes seizures now this is an oversimplification.",
            "If the biologists among you, you could criticize that because there's things about penetrance and things like that.",
            "But roughly, this allows you to delineate the region where you think that mutation in one gene typically desired Mendelian or Mendelian like disorders will cause your phenotype.",
            "So you might have a region with 10 or 100 jeans, and then you ask which one of those genes want to invalidate.",
            "OK, so basically, in this setup, the CGH microarray setup.",
            "What you would do is you would take that region.",
            "It has let's say, 100 genes.",
            "You're going to pick a couple 1, two or three, and then you are going to take other patients that don't have.",
            "This division headboard application but that have a very similar phenotype.",
            "OK so they have the same subclass of seizures, an associated other phenotypes, let's say, and you're going to re Re sequence in each of these patients your kandadji.",
            "Nor can the jeans if you take several of them to see if you can find mutations in your candidates.",
            "OK, so now if you can find convincing mutations, let's say a stop codon where it's not supposed to be in a couple patients, let's say 2 out of 200 patients, then you'll make the claim and this is a goal Center for Human Genetics.",
            "That disruption of that kinda gene causes disease.",
            "Bronze Standard is actually to go and look in model organisms.",
            "Whether you can reproduce that phenotype and if you can reproduce that phenotype, you'll say while I make the hypothesis that this is a disease causing gene for Human Genetics is does not qualify as proof.",

            "Now you could say well now, with exome sequencing we just re sequenced a whole bunch and the problem is solved and that's a discussion I don't want to go into, but in fact it doesn't change too much to the task for your money if you select good candidates, you're going to get more hits out of your screens then if you just take them a trend.",

            "If you tested offer candidates, you have to do a lot of multiple testing correction.",

            "The answer I believe firmly is no.",
            "We will still have to select good hypothesis and that allows us to map the new disease causing genes and to explain their function and in a very deep way.",

            "POV That's reversed genetics.",
            "So basically what you would do in fly as you would do mitogenesis, look for a cool phenotype and then to map the gene back.",
            "Well in humans were not going to do random mutagenesis in humans to see what happens, but you can actually collect patients from the hospital and see what their problem is.",
            "Big advantage of this is that you get an annotation that's very deep.",

            "I'm telling you that disruption of that gene may be at week 15 of developments where it's supposed to be expressing in not expressed anymore will lead to congenital heart defect, for example.",
            "So it's a very very deep form of annotation that we get from from Human Genetics, and that's a very interesting part of it.",
            "So in a sense, we use patients as a model Organism for human biology and human pathogenesis because this also explains the functions of these genes in this very rare diseases.",

            "It also affects their families.",
