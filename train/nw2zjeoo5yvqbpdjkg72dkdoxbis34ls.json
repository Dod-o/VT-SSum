            "The sources of the neon toolkit and we will also be using a Eclipse platform as development environment.",

            "Yeah, but OK, but I mean you have this idea and I will just briefly explain what you find in.",
            "OK. What you will be needing in the morning is this archive that is called Neon Toolkit 11 Bin, so this is the binaries of the neuron toolkit.",
            "This is a complete configuration.",
            "What you can do is you can just copy this file onto your local machine, unzip it, and it's a completely functioning virtual workspace.",
            "You don't need to do any insulation in addition to that.",

            "Neon toolkit plug.",

            "No OK, good so then.",
            "Let me go back to the presentation.",
