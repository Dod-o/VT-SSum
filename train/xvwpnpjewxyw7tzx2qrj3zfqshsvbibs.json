            "Whatever the purposes are.",
            "But now about simulated people.",
            "But.",
            "What about real people?",
            "And then you know analyzing that.",
            "So you know my my first first response is absolutely we should.",
            "We should look at at any examples we can for people who have successfully engaged with social scientists.",
            "The second response that I've heard from a fair number of social scientists is that's nice, but where the heck did you get all those numbers and their distressed at the number of assumptions that go into those models and the certainty with which at least some.",
            "Some of the community that build those models says oh, we're confident now that we can generalize back what social scientists call the external validity of of agent based simulation is relatively low.",
            "That is, we don't know whether we can generalize to real, real social environments.",
            "What I see, though, is an opportunity for this community and statisticians to actually provide the underpinnings of those models with data analysis, because right now what's happened is.",
            "People have sat down and said, I think that people navigate in an urban environment the following way.",
            "They haven't actually gone to the data and said, how is it that people navigate in an urban environment?",
            "And I don't know what your experience has been, but my experience has always been that my assumptions end up being radically wrong.",
            "Whenever I actually sit down and start looking at data, and I expect that that's going to happen with the with the agent based modeling community as well.",
            "So by looking at feedback by looking at spatial and temporal.",
            "Relationships.",
            "I think we're going to merge with that community, but be able to ground the underlying agent behavior in data rather than assumptions.",
            "I think that's incredibly exciting.",
            "Possibility is that we could get to the point that it's all one seamless world where we're doing simulation with learned models.",
            "Yeah, so I was just wondering.",
            "So what do we bring to the table that statisticians don't?",
            "I mean, in a sense they've got a big head start.",
            "They've been working with social science scientists for a lot longer, probably so scientists listen to them a lot more.",
            "I mean, we're kind of these strange people to decide when we bring to the table.",
            "That's a really good question, and I when I've gone and given talks, for instance at at our Statistics Department, I've sort of said, Oh well, you know you folks really, really know what you're doing and we're sort of, you know, posers as statisticians.",
            "And they've come back at me and said, Oh my God, we're so hidebound in statistics that we don't actually think about how to come up with new representations, how to come up with new algorithms.",
            "We're just in these sort of fine grained estimation problems, so I think there's actually a lot for us to learn from statisticians, because we often need that those fine grained estimation problem solved.",
            "But also we tend to go out, create new representations, take on problems, and be satisfied with approximate solutions.",
            "Ora Ora community that tolerates that, at least at first, I think what's wonderful is that we often will tolerate approximate solutions and then value exact solutions when we get them.",
            "And the sense that I have in a lot of the statistics community and statistician friends of mine have confirmed this, that you can't get by with an approximate solution, even if it's the first time anybody's come close.",
            "You need to have that absolute ironclad sort of thing.",
            "So I think our willingness to be a little bit more.",
            "I don't know what the right word is willing to take approximate solutions, an willing to innovate on languages, and what I would call what Jeanette Wing is called computational thinking about systems can really, really helped.",
            "It's a great question.",
            "Thank you hard Sciences like biology, chemistry.",
            "They also used causality as the one for major I mean method.",
            "So how the computational social science different from those hard Sciences?",
            "So in most of those Sciences, astronomy aside and a few other areas aside, you can do experiments.",
            "And if you can do a controlled randomized experiment by God, you should do it.",
            "You know, no question about it, but in social science and economics, for instance, you can't run the Great Depression over again.",
            "You wouldn't want to if you could, so you've got to take the observation.",
            "ULL data that you've got and make something of it.",
            "And in most of the hard Sciences that just hasn't been something that.",
            "That they've they've attacked because they didn't have to.",
            "They can run experiments occasionally in some of some areas that we would call hard science.",
            "Like, you know geology, astronomy, a few other things.",
            "You can't.",
            "You can't do experiments, but Jon Snow's pretty close social science, or lack of medical science or hard science.",
            "I'm sorry, medical in the snows case.",
            "Is that related to the social science or hard science?",
            "So it's interesting actually, because Johnson says at the tored, the middle of the book, he says Snow succeeded because he was a sociologist at some level, not just a doctor, not just a medical researcher that he went out to try to figure out what the conditions were that led to this.",
            "This outbreak and talk to people and went out and actually worked with, went into the.",
            "Heart of this epidemic.",
            "With some, you know some risk and investigated the details of it.",
            "And Johnson explicitly says he succeeded because he was a sociologist, so not that his medical training didn't didn't help.",
            "Obviously, I also want to point out that many of the Sciences, social Sciences are now doing limited forms of experimentation.",
            "So, for instance, criminologists have done randomized trials of sentence Ng.",
            "And it's always been the case that the individuals who are assigned to sentencing either get the sentence they would have gotten otherwise, or a lighter sentence.",
            "OK, so there have been very carefully set up randomized control trials of things that we would be a little shocked by.",
            "But because of the way that those experiments are constructed ethically, there are reasonable, as long as it's really important to get the right answer.",
            "However, we ought to use those sparingly, and if we can do it from observation, ULL data we ought to go ahead and do it.",
            "And leave those those expensive, difficult and perhaps ethically borderline randomized trials only for those cases when we absolutely have to do that.",
            "Because of time, we have the last question.",
            "David, can you tell us your thoughts on how the work done by scientists studying other non human social communities like ants or termites or even pods of whales might relate to this?",
            "Because certainly one advantage there is that the privacy concerns are not as strong.",
            "You don't find many people walking around human society with a big collar on their neck.",
            "Yeah, right.",
            "Absolutely I think that you know anthropology has gotten an enormous amount from animal behavior, and you know, the more we've looked at it, the more have realized that human societies operate very frequently, much like at least the higher level organisms, and sometimes even the lower level ones.",
            "I actually think of social science as being a much broader field than just covering human society because I think the question of how do you organize a complicated system with local control is a fascinating and deep question, and computer scientists have looked at that for a long time, but we're now getting these kind of hybrid systems.",
            "the Internet, where we have, you know, artificial agents operating doing things like making routing decisions and increasingly handling our email and doing other kinds of things.",
            "And human agents in there and we want to build these complicated systems and have the function well, so at some level that's all social science and we ought to learn from all of those pieces whenever we can.",
            "OK, well let's thank David for this fascinating topic."
