            "Is are we not heading to the conclusion?",
            "There must just be 1 standard, and if we're not, what are we going to end up with it?",

            "As he shared with the please, if you haven't read business relationship between a subcontractor in transportation and and a contractor, make sure that the invoice is much more refined than you had ever thought off.",
            "That's what he said.",
            "Yeah, he said the contract should be much more specific.",
            "I just repeat what he said.",
            "That means that by the time your standards are ready, here's a friend is something you.",
            "Yeah, here's the proof and and, and rightly so.",
            "He should.",
            "I just think this.",

            "So if his solution is large enough.",
            "2 little standard that will happen great.",
            "No problem, that will adopt A standard, but why force everybody to wait for that?",
            "Let's also find solutions for the for the situation where the standards are not yet there.",

            "I mean kind of standard is always too late to some extent because the pressure was there before him.",
            "But then again, I mean don't we have any mechanisms that would allow us to kind of adapt or to kind of further develop these kind of standards with, for example, the questions that were raised here.",
            "So there there we have a new kind of a new kind of contractor ship where we have new map, new kind of of attributes that we would like to see there.",
            "So is there a migration person?",
            "I think the the model that you gave with the Mr Semantic framework that could be very very used in order to for example say OK for.",
            "We have kind of using this standard you we are using kind of this tender communication but on top of it we also offer other opportunities right?",
            "Of course if there is a standard and parties agree to use that standard, great.",

            "Standardization bodies, standardization efforts in many fields at take a huge effort, especially if you compare it to what actually has been implemented.",

            "On the other hand, that what is communicated is most probably our value for other parties, but we don't have any means to access I. I tend to think strongly differently about communication and about to say maintaining consistent data.",

            "For communication and.",
            "If you sometimes you want to have to keep persistent data on the communication itself, that because you want to keep track of what has been confirmed or what has been stated.",
