            "She took the risk to pin it to herself and then we turned it on to see how warm she would get and she got very warm so we knew was working and so now these heating pads are actually incorporated.",

        [
            "I'm near the end, but one of the last things was also looking at the way they designed the sleeve cuffs, so this was very interesting to me because at first when you know they when the team started off they thought were going to make a jacket that looks like this and they're going to be little mittens that attached to the jacket and they will look like pockets, but they can be taken off and act as mittens and so this is the first prototype of a mid and you can see here, but the team wasn't happy with how it looked.",
            "And so they said, OK, maybe we make it look just like a pocket and will stick into the jacket.",
            "But just before they were going to try this second prototype, they put the product that sleeve jacket with the sleeve on silver and they just happened to realize that the sleeve cuff with the rib knit was actually long enough already to cover over his hand and so did it.",
            "Send it.",
            "Oh, we don't actually need pockets.",
            "We accidentally found our solution and now.",
            "We can just take this sleeve cuff and pull it over his hands and will keep it warm.",
            "So I thought that was kind of an interesting part of the design process, but you never know what you're going to do, what's going to happen, and you just have to kind of be lookout for solutions sometimes and be surprised."

        [
            "Right so at the end of the day, they ask Silver for his feedback on the jacket and you can see that in every single one of these metrics, Silver gave very high marks.",
            "I believe so.",
            "You don't really give 10, so you.",
            "So you can.",
            "You can see that there sometimes, but I think they've done accidentally and the most wonderful partners, so we're seeing that the time it took to put on the jacket was very, very comparable with the rest of the checkers he's currently bearing.",
            "So I would say it's been a fabulous success and well done to the team, alright?",
            "So maybe will.",
            "What we're going to do is just a Gentoo question and answer session, so if anyone has questions for the team for the design process, we will take questions.",
            "Maybe does it work?",
            "Yet maybe grace?",
            "Can you go over here and show the jacket also with the team?",
            "Or if somebody of the team can stand up and take their jacket and show it?",
            "Jensen so Jensen if you are.",
            "If you're talking the one who is talking has to hold the mic, otherwise it won't work and my colleague there is has a mic.",
            "So who wants to talk should hold the mic, otherwise we won't hear you.",
            "OK, who will talk?",

            "Come talk.",
            "Yes.",

            "So are there any questions?",
            "Where exactly?",
            "So it's underneath and all the wires which only comes out here.",
            "And the battery should be on.",
            "Not not right now.",
            "On this one, but it's not attached to this one yet.",
            "I mean, it's attachable, but it's not here actually there about the size of the silver fabric that you see here.",
            "Sorry, the heating pads are about the size of the silver fabric here, and this fabric is conductive, right?",
            "Fabric is cool tidbits silver, so silver is just kind of melted and the fabric is just dipped into the silver.",
            "I mean this is already done.",
            "Fabric wouldn't do it here, but this is a kind of more conductive fabric that that can make silver.",
            "Still was buddy more heated so it's kind of microfibers an the pet says micro wires, so that's the kind of padding heating system.",
            "Not to get burned, Are you sure?",
            "How to if that was a possibility that you could get burned on this?",

            "Can it happen that he?",
            "He burns on the decade.",
            "There is one of the metrics that we couldn't really test 'cause we weren't quite sure how the jacket works, but right now that has a threshold for how hot it gets.",
            "And so I think it's just too hot right now.",
            "So while we were testing it today, we found out that the highest heat level is pretty warm in Silver, got worn pretty fast, so we did turn it down.",
            "It didn't burn him, but I think in the future you'll probably design a jacket that has a lower threshold.",
            "OK.",
            "Sorry, electricity also in the battery on the wheelchair.",
            "Is it possible?",
            "Oh the Mike.",
            "It is possible there is.",
            "We actually tested today.",
            "We can plug in the Bluetooth device that will control the heated jacket right into the back.",
            "It's a 5 Volt outlet so it's simple USB connection.",
