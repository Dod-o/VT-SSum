            "So we talk about Interactive Data mining applications or most business applications were never really talking about a static system.",
            "The sitting in a corner doing something does classification, and then you measure its performance right.",
            "In a practical application, there are a lot of things that are very important.",
            "They are often ignored in research, right?",
            "So text to take some examples of things like data quality.",
            "You know there are very few papers and data quality because it's hard to evaluate it.",
            "Hard to get 10 year.",
            "Hard to write papers?",
            "What about things like you know?",
            "How easy is the system to deploy?",
            "You know how easy is?",
            "Are the parameters to tune of an algorithm?",
            "Again, not many papers because same, same issues.",
            "Evaluation criteria.",
            "Normally you know it's precision.",
            "Recall RC accuracy, right?",
            "Again, fairly simple things.",
            "In practice those exact things are never really used.",
            "They are useful as guidelines, but that's not how decisions are made.",
            "So along those lines you know, let's take an example of a problem.",
            "A lot of us have been working on and a lot of work on which is fraud detection, right?",
            "Fairly simple problem.",
            "So what's a typical talk about fraud detection in a conference looks like, well, it sounds like I got some data.",
            "Has some examples of fraud and examples of non fraud.",
            "I do some feature engineering I come up with a new algorithm.",
            "I do classification an measure, accuracy, precision, recall, RC, right?",
            "So that's a pretty standard talk.",
            "Now, what's the gap here, right?",
            "The gap in my mind here is that the goal of these systems in most of the research work is to improve this metric of let's pick one right accuracy or RC.",
            "Now the real goal of the system, which most practical applications are looking at, is not to improve.",
            "The accuracy is to improve the productivity of the expert who's already doing fraud detection.",
            "So what Barrett was talking about, right?",
            "Doctors are already doing some work.",
            "Just because you're 90% accurate doesn't mean you're useful.",
            "It's not a new problem.",
            "These people have been doing this work for a long, long time.",
            "They their job is to find more fraud cases.",
            "Just because a system exists that has 95% accuracy doesn't mean that their job is any any easier or did, or that they're getting any more return out of it, right so?",
            "The point is, sort of.",
            "I'm going to give you a lot of case studies of this, but the point is trying to make is that the goal of a system or data mining system is often.",
            "How to make a team of people who are doing their job a lot more productive and how to increase sort the return on what they're what they're they're costing you instead of improving classification accuracy.",
            "So that's sort of the Interactive Data mining setting, which is you've got a system that's making some predictions about some information, and we've got a user whose primary job it is to do something useful with that information, and this interaction between this human expert and the system is what I'm calling sort of Interactive Data mining.",
            "So Flowers are really good example, because that's it's a classic case where you've got a system doing classification.",
            "You've got a human expert whose job it is.",
            "To really find more fraud cases and when these fraud cases are found, the user is happy if you start giving them examples where it's not fraud, the user isn't happy.",
            "So now think about a lot of the research that happens in active learning, right?",
            "So active learning is in a way almost the opposite of Interactive Data mining type things or practical business things where the active learning system.",
            "If you take the most common sort of uncertainty, sampling type approaches.",
            "Now if you get an example from an uncertainty sampling approach, that's the exact example that is, the system is released, confident about so the human who's sitting there trying to find cases for fraud is very confused.",
            "Why are you giving me this example when?",
            "When you're actually confused about it, once you give me something that's you know you're very sure about 'cause that will help me and I'll be happy.",
            "Now the opposite cases.",
            "If the system starts giving these examples that are that are very it's very confident about in a matter of days to two weeks, maybe months.",
            "It's going to exhaust itself and plateau an it's not going to be useful anymore.",
            "After a month, two months, three months.",
            "So the user will be very happy for the first three months or the first few days.",
            "But then the user will start complaining that I'm not getting anything out of it.",
            "So basically, the idea behind a lot of this, the things I'm going to talk about.",
            "It's OK. Slideshow."

        [
            "Is managing through these three tradeoffs right?",
            "So there is the one over here, which we are all familiar with exploitation, which is what I want to give to the user.",
            "Is it has to be useful to the user right now?",
            "Then there is this sort of exploration tradeoff which I'd like to give something to the user that I can learn from as a system and improve overtime because I know the user is going to want something later on that's useful as well.",
            "But then any information that passes through these two also has some sort of a cost in the medical domain, so it's office often feature acquisition caused the constant talking about here is mostly about anything.",
            "Anytime a user gets an example and says is this fraud, there's a cost to auditing it as a cause to manually reviewing this thing, and that cost can vary based on how it's being presented, just the user interface type issues, or what's being presented, or what's being asked of the user.",
            "Is it fraud or not?",
            "Or do you?",
            "Are you asking for why is it fraud?",
            "And would it always be fraud?",
            "Or what if I remove this feature, is it still fraud so you can make the queries infinitely complicated and that affects the cost.",
            "Ideally what you would like to do is manage all these tradeoffs at the same time, right?",
            "So we're doing some work that we're managing all these things and we're working towards it.",
            "What I'm going to do is give you guys with some examples of things we've done that kind of span the spectrum of all these things.",
            "So to put things into context.",
            "You know this is sort of a standard relevance feedback ranking.",
            "You know you're maximizing relevancy, right?",
            "So standard classification, you do some classification or ranking and you present things to the user you're trying to optimize the relevancy to this expert at any given time, so that's that's the standard setting here.",
            "If we look at.",
            "If you look at the this site exploration only, this is standard active learning where the goal is I don't care how much it cost me.",
            "I don't care if I'm relevant to you or not.",
            "I'm going to get you something that I think this as a system.",
            "It will help me learn the most in the future so that standard active learning here.",
            "This combination is again exploration, exploitation tradeoff, starting initially from reinforcement learning, an have been used in sort of other situations as well.",
            "The part over here I'm talking about is sort of a more recent working cost sensitive active learning, so I'll give you some example that I would like to know about, but there's a cost to it and I'd like to manage that cost.",
            "This one is more expensive.",
            "This one is cheaper.",
            "This feature requires slightly more more expensive test to do that.",
            "One is a little cheaper, so how do I manage this tradeoff?",

        [
            "So I'll start with with one example here, which is managing the tradeoff between exploration and cost.",
            "So this is some work that we did a couple years back.",
            "This was around looking at descriptions of products and discovering attributes in this in these product descriptions.",
            "So one why is it an important problem?",
            "Well, every product company, every advertising company, pretty much everybody who's dealing with any product.",
            "They have a product database.",
            "Typically this product database doesn't have much information in there.",
            "So if you look at this laptop is an HP laptop.",
            "HP has a pretty good database about it.",
            "Now that's for the best case scenario.",
            "If you look at the database of whoever made this this T shirt or whoever made this carpet or this piece of the screen there databases are very, very impoverished.",

            "In this case they might say it's a shirt.",

            "I might be looking for something that's trendy or something that's classic or high brand appeal or conservative.",
            "So they're very, very impoverished.",
            "That extreme case in this impoverished databases, in my mind is eBay, where eBay is selling hundreds of millions of products on their website, but they actually have no idea what they're selling.",
            "There's no catalog for eBay.",
            "People go in and put whatever they want to put there, and they fill in some forms.",
            "They'll say this is the brand is the thing, but often that information is incorrect because it's it's game to get higher search listings and more often it's just not filled out completely.",
            "Because there's no requirement to get filled out, but they'll put all the words in the keyword so that anything comes up in the search, so that's that's a big problem in a lot of these companies face, so one of the things we and I'm not going to talk about too much detail about the basic system because there's lots of papers and have given talks before about that, but the system we built was able to sort of automatically look at the descriptions of text of product descriptions and extract his.",
            "Here's an attribute.",
            "Here's an attribute.",
            "So in the case of if you're looking at.",
            "Used car listings, it might say.",
            "Logo appears on the item is an attribute that Sonnen attribute.",
            "You would have thought about in the beginning because it's not an attribute that occurs in product listings, but for an an auction listing for a used thing.",
            "Logo appearing on so if it's a BMW tire.",
            "If it's a logo appears, it's value is much higher than if a logo doesn't appear so it does affect its selling price and that's why it's an important attribute, but ideas you can go through all sorts of these descriptions and automatically discover that this is an attribute and this is a value and extract those things.",
            "Now that's a static system, right?",
            "And there's a one time you build a classifier.",
            "You run the classifier and then it gives you the results.",
            "Now what you want to do is is there are again.",
            "Let's take the example of eBay.",
            "There are people in the eBay who are whose job it is to build these catalogs and they've been doing instead of mostly manually or semi automatically where they do some searches and they find some attributes in their enrich.",
            "So that's mostly searching and then and finding these attributes.",
            "Now what we would like to do is make a system that they can improve overtime themselves and their byproduct is they're looking for long term results.",
            "So they really care about a year from now.",
            "I'd like to have 10 of my categories.",
            "Done so that I have a catalog for these ten categories today it takes them about, you know, three to four months, three to four person, months per category.",
            "They've got hundreds of categories.",
            "They're never going to finish if they keep going manually.",
            "So what we experimented with was a system that's in the beginning, very static.",
            "But then whether it's able to do is start doing active learning, but sort of cost sensitive, right?",
            "So active learning when you start getting examples.",
            "Turns out most of the practical most of the.",
            "Active learning algorithms aren't really that interactive.",
            "Typically in the active learning experiments, the way they run in most papers you read are you get a bunch of data that are all labeled.",
            "You hide the labels, you set up the experiment overnight, you go home, and the experiment simulates active learning, so you have no idea how long it actually takes to actually do these iterations when you put it into deployment, something like this turns out a lot of active learning algorithms we tried, including the ones I wrote, papers in grad school.",
            "Took about 15 to 20 minutes of time in between each iteration, so you label something you wait around for 15 minutes and the user is waiting there waiting for something good to come out.",
            "15 minutes later you ask them for something else.",
            "That way, interactive, not very useful, not deployable.",
            "So what do we have to do?",
            "We had to come up with.",
            "Approximations to the active learning algorithms that were not as accurate.",
            "So then we have traded off a few percentage of accuracy, but we were able to improve its time from 15 minutes to 15 seconds.",
            "And that's really another tradeoff that that was extremely important.",
            "The users.",
            "And if you look at if you calculate the economic value of that time, those 15 minutes that you wasted, you can bump up your accuracy but much more than the few percentage that you lossed because you choose an inferior algorithm.",
            "But it took so much faster you can get a lot more examples you can order of magnitude more examples.",
            "And those are worth the extra two 3% that you lost in terms of accuracy.",
            "And again there are some papers about that I can point you guys to later.",
            "I'm not going to go into the details here.",
            "So second example.",
            "For which is now sort of exploitation exploration.",
            "Trade off and form filling.",
            "You know we all fill forms all the time, and none of us like to fill forms.",
            "The the place where people who don't fill forms very well are actually doctors.",
            "Doctors hate fill in forms.",
            "So what do they do?",
            "They dictate things and somebody else fills out the form for them and lot of errors occur right there.",
            "The example we review is not we didn't apply it to doctors, but that's some of the things we're looking at is how do you.",
            "The things that was talking about about the quality of the measure, all the measures you could think of it as a form filling task with this form needs to fill out which it is, and doctors don't fill it out.",
            "It's their nurses who fill it out from the notes of the doctors.",
            "So if you can make the notes more interactive so that they're filling out the form as you're writing the notes, that becomes sort of an interesting problem.",
            "The problem will be titled here was around filling forms about.",
            "This was an internal problem we had.",
            "We have a large number of people submitting documents to be shared internally.",
            "An every document needs to have a set of fields filled out in a structured way so it can be searched, indexed, all that stuff and we have people today who sit down and do this manual thing and they fill out about 25 to 30 fields.",
            "Now the task here was that today they're going.",
            "They have some ordering that's fairly random and ad hoc that somebody came up with that made sense intuitively to humans.",
            "They go and look at the actual piece of content, which is the document.",
            "And they go fill out for no field.",
            "1234 up to 25.",
            "And they spend a lot of time doing it.",
            "So initial thoughts to fixing this problem was we thought, well we can just build a classifier for each of these fields, 25 fields and that way you know they can just fill out all of those themselves.",
            "Again, not a very deployable system, because if you just predict those things are going to be wrong, you have to design the user interface that it really helps them do this thing.",
            "You can give him a rank list for each each thing and all those things that the solution we ended up with was basically a approach to do ordering different classification tasks.",
            "With an optimal order so that the first task helps the second task, but the first has to be correct as well.",
            "So there is the explore exploitation thing where you predict an answer for task one or field one that has to be correct or reasonably correct.",
            "But it also has to be useful to predict the rest of the 24 things, and this optimal ordering is really hard, and it's an NP hard problem.",
            "So again, you come up with approximations that let you find the optimal order for each form differently.",
            "Now again, the solution we came up with and we found this optimal order worked really well in theory.",
            "But if the order changes every time, the user isn't happy again, so there's this annoying user sitting there saying what's going on.",
            "I don't know what to do.",
            "You keep changing the order on me.",
            "I liked my my static order, So what do we end up deploying?",
            "The solution that is again less than optimal.",
            "It doesn't change it every example, but we can take an entire corpus and find a static ordering that works.",
            "That's on average optimal for the whole set, but not optimal for individual things, so we lose again a few percent in accuracy.",
            "But the predictability of the system the user is comfort enough and fast enough to do this so that they get the right.",
            "They do the right thing and then they're happy and we get on average better results than we would have otherwise.",
            "So again, the user you know these trade off.",
            "So the third example is 1.",
            "I'm going to not describe the basic system too much because I have another talk tomorrow.",
            "So if you're interested in that and it's a really interesting cool topic that we're going to talk about tomorrow, so come to that talk.",
            "But the idea there is we're dealing with in the US right now.",
            "It's a very big problem, and in the US.",
            "For these this thing we call health insurance in the US right?",
            "And the way it works is you, as a patient have some sort of a benefit plan insurance company officer probably employed still, so we have an insurance plan.",
            "You go to the doctor, the doctor does something to you.",
            "The doctor sends a bill to insurance company.",
            "The insurance company pays the doctor, right?",
            "So that's the process you go to.",
            "Doctor Doctor Pays and ask for money.",
            "Insurance company pays the doctor.",
            "Now it turns out.",
            "Like any company, insurance companies also make mistakes and a lot of mistakes and mistakes worth a lot of money.",
            "So according to some estimates you know about an average, I think.",
            "There have been some companies typical large insurance companies waste about half a billion to a billion dollars a year on mistakes.",
            "They probably make processing these claims so they either pay more than they should have or they pay less than they should have.",
            "If they paid more, they have to then find, figure out they paid more.",
            "That's hard for them and then get money back from the doctor if they paid less, the doctor complaints them call them up all the time.",
            "The patients called them.",
            "I haven't you paid my bill.",
            "And they have to pay money back and then they have to pay interest.",
            "So on average there about.",
            "A third of the administrative staff of a typical insurance company in the US health insurance.",
            "Is their job is to fix these claims once they've been processed, so once the error has been made, a third of them are just exist in a company to fix these claims, which is a huge amount of money being wasted in our healthcare system.",
            "So a project that we recently started and have been working on is how do you predict the errors in these claims before the payment is made?",
            "And if you can predict these errors, how do you help humans whose job it is to audit these claims?",
            "How do you make them a lot more efficient?",
            "And so we built the basic system again.",
            "That does usually have data.",
            "We do a lot of feature engineering.",
            "We come up with classification algorithms.",
            "We do the prediction and great good good.",
            "But then the real interesting stuff starts right after that.",
            "Once you've made these predictions, there's a user the user wants to find their job is to find as many errors as possible.",
            "They get rewarded on the number of errors they find, not how much they train the system to do the right thing.",
            "And so when we start doing active learning, you know again, not not not a very good thing.",
            "So what we started when we did a pilot with these people.",
            "Turned out you know when we so the standard problem off we do classification.",
            "We given ranking of the slides about that probably so we do rank these these claims in order of likelihood of being errors and the user start going from the top.",
            "Then we talk to these users after the first pilot they said, well the accuracy is, you know, is reasonable.",
            "When I get down to the bottom, so because there were used to about 5 to 10%.",
            "Precision in their cases because they were doing random audit, quality control things and some rule based things and things like that.",
