            "The material will bunch up in the front door.",
            "It's too short in the back.",
            "And then if you can imagine as well because you're in a sitting position, the amount of fabric over the knee becomes stretched.",
            "It becomes too tight, and so most of the time Katerina had to wear sweatpants."

        [
            "So what the team was trying to do was to create something aesthetically pleasing, comfortable, high under Beck, fits well around the knee, and will allow for easy access to the urine bag."
        ],
        [
            "So here's the final solution you came up with.",
            "It's really elegant piece of work, so Katarina wanted something that looked like jeans and then they also put in this high back end or front as you can see here."
        ],
        [
            "And then they decide wrinkles at the side of the knee.",

        ],
        [
            "Better.",
            "In addition, they put a long zipper in the lower leg so you could open it up to access to urine bag very quickly in the initial sketch, I think they were thinking about putting a little pocket in the side of the pens as well to hold the urine bag, but eventually I realized that the Velcro for the urine bag that usually attaches urine bag to katarina's leg worked well enough so they didn't put in the pocket in the end.",
            "But here's the zipper."
        ],
        [
            "And finally they found this very soft, stretchy material that looked like denim, and so that also made it really comfortable."
        ],
        [
            "So at the end they were very very successful in making something that was attractive, comfortable, high in the back.",
            "Sorry, that 4th metric is shouldn't be there an it was allowed for Katarina to have easy access to urine bag, so that was the first project."
        ],
        [
            "The second project was a lot more complex and it was for Katarina to be able to put on and take off a jacket by herself.",

            "She isn't able to use her fingers too well.",
            "And so it makes putting on and taking off a jacket difficult.",
            "You should issue as a personal assistant to help her.",
            "Also, she can still drive wheelchair with the joystick, so she needed to make sure that the sleeves were not so long that it prevented her from using the joystick on a wheelchair.",
            "And so sometimes when she bought jackets with sleeves that were the right length, the shoulder width would become too small and so that will make it very difficult for dressing.",
            "So she needed something that would balance well between the length of the sleeve and the width of the shoulder.",
            "And then again the jacket needed to be cut for the sitting position."

        [
            "Right so.",

            "So here's the final jacket.",
            "You can see it's black, purple and pink, which are all katarina's favorite colors.",
            "The team managed to find a very beautiful wool is a natural wool.",
            "That purple layer in there is a natural wool, so it's very soft, very comfortable and very warm, and is also very thin.",
            "Sorta.",
            "Jacket didn't become too bulky and made it easier to be put on."
        ],
        [
            "And also it's cut for the sitting position, so is shorter in front and longer behind, but a few of the I'm going to go through the most interesting features in this jacket.",
            "The first one is that they put in a zipper in the front of the jacket.",
            "We actually brought it over from America with.",
            "Invented by an American occupational therapist and engineer, and is actually licensed now by an athletic company there.",
            "But what it is is that usually is the first is very difficult to fast and the bottom and so by putting in magnets at the bottom, it becomes a zipper that will fast and by itself.",
            "Um?"
        ],
        [
            "So they tested it with Katarina to see if it was going to well, if Katarina would be able to use the zipper.",
            "Ann I'm just going to play the video here.",
            "And so that's a zipper.",
            "At first they traded just alone outside of a jacket, but he realized it was too difficult.",
            "So then they pinned it to her jacket.",
            "To see if she would be able to use it better if she could hold on to a jacket to do it, and you can tell her sleeves are getting into ways.",
            "So had we had to roll her sleeves back.",
            "And so Katarina still has some hand function.",
            "And she was trying to use a zip, but then that piece of fabric got in the way so they had to pin it down.",
            "Then he tried again.",
            "And it it went together, it went together.",
            "So do a very excited about this and so decided to loop a piece of fabric to see if Katarina would be able to pull it up.",
            "And then we realized that we needed to anchor the bottom of the zipper down.",
            "And so that's when they put in another loop at the bottom of the jacket.",
            "Right there.",
            "So you will not see it here, but eventually Katarina was able to pull it up."
        ],
        [
            "And so this is the jacket with the zifa.",
            "Sorry, maybe you can show it later.",
            "I think we ran out of camera space and then yeah, so at least we have a video of her.",
            "Unzipping, does it further, and So what you see is that the team also put in loops, decide to zipper so that she could pull it all the way down like that.",
            "And it could open up.",
            "So unzipping was very successful."
        ],
        [
            "OK, so that was more about putting it on and then we thought about how is she going to take it off.",
            "And if you actually breakdown whole process, there are a lot of steps to taking off the jacket, but one of the things we noticed was that if someone held on to the side of his sleeve, Katarina could pull him out of the sleeve and so we thought.",
            "Well, what if we put, you know, a loop on the sleeve and then this loop could catch onto the armrest of her wheelchair and then she would be able to pull her arm out and so that's what he did.",
            "They put a loop in there, it took them a few tries to figure out where to put the loop."
        ],
        [
            "Anne again.",
            "You can see the end of her taking that arm out.",
            "Katarina was a really good sport and trying and trying.",
            "This.",
            "I'm.",
            "And we almost got it out except for the little bit.",
            "Yes, so I believe in that version it wasn't able to pull out completely, but what the team is going to do is to open up the width of a little bit more so the jacket will be able to fall off.",
            "More in should be able to pull it out, yeah?"
        ],
        [
            "Alright, so then you know the other small features like for the pocket they put in these loops so Katarina can actually open and close the jacket pocket by herself and they put in a sleeve cuff that was ribbed knit so that it wouldn't interfere with her use of the joystick and they also made a detachable hood for her so she could use it in the rain or keep warm."
        ],
        [
            "And so at the end of the day.",
            "They did wonderfully well.",
            "I thought this was extremely complex and difficult challenge and I actually didn't think it was going to be possible to be able to put on and take off a jacket independently by gosu to show how independent how creative they've been.",
            "And so they did really well.",
            "These metrics Auto 5 and almost everything was successful and I'm pretty sure once we tweak the jacket to show be able to take it off independently as well."
        ],
        [
            "So that's the end.",
            "Ann will love to take questions for Team Katarina now.",
            "So maybe Hedwig, you show the and Mya, can you show the jacket and trousers?",
            "And the one who will talk should use the mic, because otherwise we cannot record you.",
            "Yeah, so you saw on the pictures.",
            "So we this magnet Cypress really cool.",
            "With a bit of little time, she managed to pull it down and then we got this idea of doing loops.",
            "After a while it was actually today we got no.",
            "Yesterday we got the idea of the loops so it comes like every time we met Katarina with the new prototype we got another idea and another idea and also this reducing her wheelchair because she's always on the wheelchair when she has the jacket on so we could actually really design this jacket and use the wheelchair as.",
            "As a help too.",
            "To get the jacket off, and this was also really nice to get this idea with the so it's actually this one.",
            "This loop is on on one side of jacket, the upper part and this is on the lower and this is regulated so she can with one arm take off like that and the other arm she take off like that.",
            "So it's like really for Katarina.",
            "This jacket, every solution.",
            "So what else?",
            "Yeah, it has.",
            "She wanted to be warm in the next, so we have a high neck for that.",
            "We got the opportunity to use laser cut.",
            "Also here, and this is only aesthetics.",
            "The pocket was important.",
            "She bring her mobile phone and card and things that she told me like if she has a bag in a laugh, maybe someone can just take it from her.",
            "If she's in the city, so the more valuable stuff it would be nice to have a pocket and to reach the pocket she want to reach the pocket with the right hand to the left side.",
            "So that's why we have one pocket on the left side and she can open it herself.",
            "And it's like a straight pocket so it doesn't fall.",
            "Out the stuff.",
            "It's not that was the idea with that.",
            "And yeah, detachable hood.",
            "So also you can have like two different looks.",
            "Also, in an it's actually a spring jacket, so if it's warm like today, she maybe doesn't need to have the hood.",
            "And yeah.",
            "Yeah, the Cavs Cavs you say.",
            "We wanted to have slippers or Catherine.",
            "I want to have separate so she even easier get out from the jacket.",
            "But then we thought also the Super can interfere because Catherine has two different wheelchairs.",
            "An one when she dragged herself with on the wheel and then we also thought the secret can be a bit annoying.",
            "Annoying to have it like it can touch her hand so we skipped the Super an we only have stretchable cups inside.",
            "It's a very slippery material, so Katarina is here.",
            "Get out so it slips off is here and this jacket is the idea of being in leather.",
            "Leather holds is very holds very long.",
            "Have a very long life time and it's safe from rain.",
            "And it looks cool, so let's see I guess.",
            "Depends Katrina, where a lot of like jogging pants or like really soft pant that she want to look more like now these occasions like jeans she preferred jeans and she wants off jeans comfortable.",
            "So we tried to find the really stretchy material that.",
            "Is look like denim and we have this super four to reach the urine bag and it has a safe so you don't see on the during back because Katarina want to feel safe that the urine bag doesn't.",
            "Nothing can happen to the urine bag also, that's why we took away the pocket idea to sit on the jeans because it's somehow a part of her body, so she doesn't want it to be on.",
            "Yeah, like that did something could like get to it or is?",
            "Yeah and.",
            "We had a bit of.",
            "Difficulties with the back.",
            "We thought wow, this will never be.",
            "It looks really high, but actually when Katrina's it's it's, it's a very good height.",
            "It comes not high at all.",
            "It's so this is a good design for Katarina Ann and Denise.",
            "Maya did really well idea with the extra material underneath, so it's really good in sitting position.",
            "Yeah, and the Catalina want tight jeans so we did it as tight as possible for the urine bag also.",
            "That's it, thank you, Katrina, can you share your experience please in Slovenian.",
