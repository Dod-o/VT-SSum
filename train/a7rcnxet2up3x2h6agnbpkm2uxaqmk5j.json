            "Interesting.",
            "OK, as I have already well maybe I tried to explain a little bit that one dimension.",
            "It's quite different than two or three for some particular reasons, so there are reasons to expect that that if you go to some higher dimension, maybe you will have some effects which are not visible in 1, two or three.",
            "Or maybe that's some approximations that are not good, let's say in 1, two or three will be good in 4 dimensions, and so on.",
            "So mean field, for example.",
            "Yeah, so this is one of the reasons why I think this is an interesting another reason, let's say in photonics that we have looked into is that maybe you can do some.",
            "Optical devices, which would be which would have more.",
            "More versatile input output characteristics than standard optical devices, and so on.",
            "So I think it's to me also actually to be quite honest is interesting person.",
            "Do you have some reason why you like more little model than other integrable models?",
            "I mean or can you also do similar description of this quench dynamics?",
            "Exact description of mixing other internal?",
            "Actually this is a good question so we took Lib linear model because it is actually the model that describes really well this one dimensional ultracold gases, but for example at injure Liquid is actually a bit easier.",
            "To solve to the best of my knowledge, and it can also be used to describe this system, so this is another interesting model that one can use, and you can also find in condensed matter systems and so on.",
            "We can focus on these systems because they.",
            "Describe well the experimental systems that people were.",
            "Having so, this was the reason I guess would be more general.",
            "I mean it can be it can be more general and it answers all of the problems better and that's it.",
            "Yeah, there is a really vast number of models that one can attack with veterans that send that one can use to understand the problems that I have talked about from more general viewpoint, not just ultracold atomic gases gases but more general theoretical.",
            "Let's say questions which one can address, like nonequilibrium dynamics, questions of integrability and integrability, and so on.",
            "OK, I already asked you, but once again I mean, do you think you can include description of noise or dissipation somehow in this actually?",
            "Then what kind of noise do you have in mind?",
            "So any OK, any different thing?",
            "OK, yes, so, So what we were interested in was understanding dynamics in this system, not just dynamics.",
            "Actually, the state of the system.",
            "A very important problem is that the founders and localization here and people are debating whether there is or isn't understand localization.",
            "If you would be able to exactly solve the Lib linear model with some random potential.",
            "So we have been analyzing this problem in the tongue Gerard case, but there it's relatively simple.",
            "I have to be honest, there is something that is essentially non interacting or it is strongly interacting, but you can map it to noninteracting fermions.",
            "So essentially it's not interacting so it's much easier.",
            "Yeah, so we looked into correlations there.",
            "This is something that's let's say new, but Lib linear model people are still debating over this and I will be Frank.",
            "We tried to actually solve this problem and we failed.",
            "We did not succeed.",
            "So it would be very interesting to understand dynamics in the Lib linear model if you have some small static but random potential or even like random Delta functions in space.",
            "This is actually that we tried to do.",
            "By hand and failed to do it because the system becomes non integrable even when you place 1D function inside your space.",
            "It's non integrable anymore and.",
            "Yeah, so we just doesn't work, but maybe you can do something by mapping by gluing some internal systems together.",
            "Like a standard standard map, you know.",
            "You can do kick Trotter like kicks and free.",
            "Revolution which is making.",
            "We tried a number of things, but it turns out that it just doesn't work.",
            "Maybe you will have some better idea than we had, but understand localization in the Lib linear model.",
            "This is a very important problem, so this is some noise, but we actually analyzed wash Mitt echo dynamics.",
            "This is something that I didn't understand, didn't talk about, but dynamics when you have some small random noise, but this is in a strongly repulsive case and we compared this.",
            "Where you have a Gaussian behavior of this loschmidt echo in time with this is also this is a nonlinear Schrodinger equation which describes weakly interacting case, so we compare strong interactions and weak interactions, and we see quite a big difference.",
            "Both of them are integrable without noise but with noise.",
            "We see that this one.",
            "It's essentially one and very suddenly drops to 0 for weak interactions and for strong.",
            "It's always the Gaussian decay.",
            "So we did investigate dynamics with some.",
            "Purchase small perturbation inside, but only in this limit of very strong interactions or just a little bit below it or weak but not Liebling agree this would be.",
            "This would be really nice if somebody would know how to deal with this.",
            "More questions.",
            "I have another question, so you said that when confining particles into traps created by lasers, you can do 1D confinement and 3D confinement that this is obvious.",
            "What about 2D confronted?",
            "How do you do that?",
            "You said that you can do it, I just don't know.",
            "We do not do it, we're theorist, but there are people that can do it.",
            "What they can do create is really really flat really flat like pancake type potentials by using.",
            "Like laser sheets, but also magnetic trapping.",
            "There are different kinds of trapping.",
            "Magnetic and optical trapping and combination of magnetic and optical trapping, and they can do like pancake like potentials and observe transitions like specific for two dimension like.",
            "Brezinski, thoughtless, kosterlitz transition and yeah.",
