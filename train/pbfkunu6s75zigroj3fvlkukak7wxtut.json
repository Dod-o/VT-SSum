            "All the stakeholders were not playing together, so that was the idea.",
            "And also to showcase innovative and promising practices in new year policies and initiatives from around the world.",

            "It's not moved forward that dramatically.",
            "Yes, it is much better than what it used to be when we did the first conference, but.",
            "There's a long way to go.",
            "And the objective, therefore, are significantly different from the First world or your Congress.",
            "This time round we have decided to have three objectives.",
            "And I think you will really concerned because the regional consultations are going to be based on the objectives and the sites that we have set.",
            "Firstly, examine solutions to meeting the challenges of mainstreaming or your practices in education systems worldwide, and this is absolutely crucial.",
            "As long as we are remains in the fringes as long as it's just one more way of delivering education and access to educational resources, it won't work.",

            "And Thirdly.",
            "Provide recommendations for the mainstreaming of we are with links to best practices now.",
            "We have identified.",
            "Several challenges, in fact, 5 challenges, and I hope all of you are aware of these challenges and that this regional consultation focuses mainly on these five challenges.",
            "The first challenge identified is the capacity of users to access, reuse and share here.",
            "There seems to be major gaps in this area.",
            "The second challenge is language and culture issues.",
            "Most languages do not have or your content and therefore it is absolutely critical that we keep in mind that when we encourage Member States to develop your content that they do it in local languages.",

            "Absolutely of the essence here, and I hope you keep that in mind.",
            "4th one is the whole issue of changing business models.",
            "Because one of the reasons for which applicable years is has been limited has been the fact that the business models don't seem to be.",
            "Suitable number one and #2.",
            "I think there's a lack of understanding as can be the relevant business models to make it a success.",
            "And the last challenge is the development of supportive policy environments, and this is where, of course UNESCO an called player major role convincing our Member States to adopt or your policies create the right enabling environments and so on.",
            "So let me finish by saying that this regional consultations are absolutely critical for the success of the Second World or your Congress 2017.",
