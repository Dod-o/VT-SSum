            "Well, they are generally tools that are able to access one or more data source.",
            "This is one of the things so you don't have to think about one database or one whatever we are talking about, a number of databases as well, so link data if you want, and especially they are not search tools in the in the sense of completely automated tools performing for example sparkles.",
            "Sparkle queries we're talking over tools they have are human in the loop.",
            "You can.",

            "There are two points.",

        [

            "Once the query is being fired, what you get there is also can be used to do that.",
            "So effectiveness and user satisfactions are very close to close by together and efficiency of course is again efficiency.",
            "In two terms, one is once you have the query, how fast the system is, but also is if the user in the loop.",

            "Another is scalability.",

        [
            "Ocean has been done in a way so that you can evaluate all these things are the two levels, so the level of actually from the from the user to the query and then from the query to the result so.",

            "Now in the in the campaign you can choose which of the two?",

            "So how well does the underlying engine interpret the complexity of sparkle, scalability and performance and quality and documentation of course, but for the user in the loop we test usability and again query expressiveness because I said that can be a case when the user interface doesn't allow you to create a very complex query."
