            "And then you shake it up.",
            "And.",
            "I tried to fool your intuition that if I lose energy in the collisions where then you inject energy and then you basically thermal again and I'm trying to violate that because in the thermal case the following would happen.",
            "You have 50 particles.",
            "Chuckling here, 50 particles tracking there and they change places.",
            "And in terms of fluctuations there is no conceptual problem saying I fluctuations or 5540 five 6040 so they can exchange and volume fluctuate.",
            "And in a thermal system you cool down if we cool down the room here, there would not be a corner over here where all the oxygen molecules gather.",
            "So this is a truly non equilibrium structure formation effect if you like.",
            "And the reason is the following.",
            "So the particles are not thermal.",
            "I have a high energy throughput because I lose energy upon collision with my other particles and the wall.",
            "And I inject energy and here I have an asymmetry because.",
            "Let's say if I have 48 and 52 that's allowed, but if I now lower the driving, I have the effect that at the place where I already have more particles, it's harder to push through energy.",
            "And then I have a lower energy content where I have more particles.",
            "And it's easier for me to push energy through a particle system where I have a lower number of particles.",
            "That's actually the same mechanism in principle.",
            "If you have things solidly in space that at a place where you already have a higher density, you dissipate more energy, and you have a higher likelihood of further particles agglomerating there.",
            "And this is a truly non equilibrium runaway process, and this is a nice demonstration of that.",
            "Shake things and they behave like thermal.",
            "Is not the right way of thinking about granular materials, so if you repeated the experiment then you would maybe next experiment.",
            "You will get more particles in the other compartment so but always there will be one compartment, one compartment that wins.",
            "And if you always have the particles on the left hand side, your apparatus is not symmetric.",
            "But if you do that 10 times you have you have the particles ones left and once right.",
            "Thank you.",
            "So thanks for very interesting seminar so that condensation phenomena.",
            "It happens also with any compartments, right?",
            "You can do that with more compartments.",
            "Yeah, people have done that and then treat it as a statistical physics system and even get to a critical point like physics when you address in which compartment you gather more particle smoke.",
            "But in this case I mean in general.",
            "Yeah, that's the role of temperature.",
            "Is the intensity of the drive right?",
            "Yeah.",
            "And do you have something like coming?",
            "I am sure that it should be attempts to define something like Boltzmann measure for them.",
            "Yes, there's a fully worked out theory for even multiple compartments, and I can point you to that after the talk, where you can find that.",
            "It's not really an isotropic hydrodynamics, because it's essential that you have gravity for picking up energy and for coming down, so the geometry is highly UN isotropic.",
            "It's not a homogeneous system, but it is a system where you can understand the energy throughput and make a nice model of how it works.",
            "OK thanks.",
            "So the candy question.",
            "Yeah, so so why do they cluster the in the ISS experiment?",
            "So first of all, the msor, the ellipsoidal candy as I'm supposed to say.",
            "Have additional rotational motion which makes them more interesting.",
            "I claimed early in the talk that if I have a sphere and a bounce it off or I bounce it off from other particles, I can clearly identify if I run the movie backwards or forward, which is an easy and illuminating way to distinguish equilibrium for nonequilibrium dynamics.",
            "If I have a.",
            "Non rotationally symmetric particle like let's say this laser pointer.",
            "I could shoot a particle against even a wall and translate.",
            "Transfer alot of energy from translation into rotation.",
            "So if I throw that against the wall.",
            "I can have that thing coming back with very much rotational motion and that's why we found it interesting to also look at the motion and the evolution of nonspherical particles.",
            "In the end, you find they all cool.",
            "There are certain interesting aspects about the equipartition of energy which no longer holds in such a situation.",
            "And for the density you see in those.",
            "Compartments we seem to have few enough particles that the.",
            "Relatively higher density sounding rocket experiment calculation is no longer valid.",
            "So what you can do if you look at the hydrodynamics of the granular system is you find out that the first mode that goes unstable is the sheer mode and the share board needs a certain wave number, and we probably don't have the wave number in our system.",
            "If we look at the M&M's.",
            "And we're trying to understand that it's an open question why they cluster.",
            "You could even argue I, I'm not even convinced that I have the right structural visual impression of what's happening here, and you could say if I have such few particles only 60.",
            "Any impression of the human brain must be heterogeneous, but we do find that we do have.",
            "Denser and less dense patches and we do that over and over again, so it may or may not be a nonlinear way of stability that we need to address to look at this.",
            "For that case, the explanation I gave earlier that where I have more particles, I have more energy dissipation, of course still holds.",
            "But you want a numerical description of how does it go?",
            "What's the unstable mode and stuff like that?",
            "We don't have that for the nice estimate experiment yet.",
            "More questions.",
            "If I may just one one more out of curiosity, and these the drop tower experiment and the sounding rocket experiment.",
            "The experiment is supposed in the drop tower.",
            "For example, right.",
            "The experiment is destroyed or not.",
            "No, it's not destroy, it's not destroyed.",
            "So how do you arrest the service?",
            "What you do is you put it.",
            "On top of a catapult.",
            "And then you you shoot it up and that needs to be very precise because you shoot it up by 100 meters.",
            "And then it's coming down again.",
            "And what you saw in the movie is that.",
            "After the catapult has thrown it up.",
            "You don't want your instrument landing on the catapult, and that's why a big box 5 meters in diameter of a big container of polystyrene granular materials is swung underneath.",
            "And if you wouldn't evacuate the container or the drop tube, those particles would ignite by the sheer energy deposition from the impact.",
            "But since we have a vacuum of a couple Pascal, there's not enough oxygen to.",
            "To ignite anything, So what comes in here is a big splash of granular materials where we land our drop capsule and then you can nicely recover everything that's inside.",
            "There is no lateral control.",
            "That's what I meant by the wine glass impact wise.",
            "If you put a wine glass on the drop tube it would be so.",
            "The catapult is very accurate so there it would not destroy the wine glass.",
            "Then it would come down straight.",
            "But as soon as you splash it into an arrangement of granular media it would tilt.",
            "So you would probably spill some wine.",
            "Until the glass, but you're not breaking it by the accelerations.",
            "Thank you, Matthias, very much.",
            "Thank you."
