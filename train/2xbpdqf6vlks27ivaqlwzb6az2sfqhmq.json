        [
            "And once we have done that, then we can start our counterfeit EPC detection.",
            "So what we do is we look at each and every event we check if the if the business type essentially EPC counterfeit EPC direction is checking is checking that something that was commissioned or given an EPC appears in the aggregation an anything in the aggregation which has an EPC which was not seen in the object event is supposed to be counterfeit.",
            "So based on that we check the packing event and see if the event which was seen here the EPC which was senior.",

            "We use sparkle queries to do all these checks and we have an implementation that is running on top of stream processor to direct the count of it and this is an easy approach.",
            "So one thing could be that as soon as you there is an event you check for counterfeit because the EPC is already encoded in the event.",
            "But what we do is we wait till the pedigree generation time to check for the EP to check for the counterfeits.",

            "Particular part of the algorithm I would like to highlight, which explicitly shows how the events are being extracted from the graph.",

        [
            "The end what we had is this is just a representative example of how we manage the various steps in the steps in the evaluation process with the different volumes and basically overall we did a run of 404 hundred algorithmic exercises to evaluate this particular pedigree generation."
        ],
        [
            "For them, this is the architecture that we use so that you can see over here that we've used in RDF stream processor to actually do the counterfeit eventually EPC checking."

            "So.",
            "Yeah, yes, just two minutes.",

            "But actually this turned out that was not the case.",
            "It actually depends on the rate at which the events are commissioned, so the which the products are Commission.",
            "So depending on the commissioning event rate in the graph."
        ],
        [
            "Ladies in this way, so typically it's, uh now after after doing the analysis it was pretty obvious to us that in order to have a faster pedigree pedigree generation time, you need to actually manage the number of objects you are commissioning and therefore the number of EPC's in every commissioning event."
        ],
        [
            "So to summarize, what we've done in in this process of doing, tracking and tracing within the pharmaceutical supply chain is actually try and understand that if the paper pedigree trail was to be replaced by a linked data powered pedigree trail, then what would be the implications?",
            "So what would what would be the kind of pedigree generation time that we were looking at based on these realistic volumes of EPS events and what would be the counterfeit EPC detection time which is?",
            "A very important part of within these within the specifically within the pharmaceutical supply chain.",
            "Having said that, this particular approach is really domain agnostic, so if one were to put pick this approach up for the even let's say for the Agri food supply chain it would pretty much work the same, except that what you would need to change are the times the number of pieces per event and the aggregation and the decommissioning steps in the process.",
