            "So let's start with target tracking.",
            "So imagine you have a set of agents.",
            "In this case, they are moving cameras, so these cameras can do some movement, pan tilt and zoom, and what you want to do is to target track targets which are present in the scene.",
            "So in particular, here you will going to have two targets, so they're very suspicious guys, which is called diabolic.",
            "And then they also very suspicious woman which is called ever the first thing you should ask yourself when you try to.",
            "Model A problem using the copies.",
            "Why do you want to decentralize?",
            "OK, because from an optimization point of view, to decentralize solution process doesn't make too much sense in terms of efficiency or in terms of effectiveness you decentralize because you cannot centralized usually.",
            "OK, so for example, in this case a very good reason for the centralization is that you want to be robust to failures, so you don't want to have a central point of failure.",
            "So if you send all the information to a central system, that will compute the solution and send back the actions.",
            "If the central system fails.",
            "Of course, you're going to be stuck in this case.",
            "You can even if one of the camera fails, you can still have the great performance, but you can still track some of the targets that are present in your scene, and this is a very important thing.",
            "Now going back to the problem addition, assume that cameras that you have can do only two actions, either look left or look right and assume that this is a very common assumption in target tracking problems that if two cameras are looking at the same target, you will have a better estimate of the target position.",
            "OK, so you have a more more accurate estimation of the position, So what you want to do in this case is basically to have the most accurate estimation of all the targets position and so.",
            "Optimal actions in this case would be these two camera pointing to the Bolick and the other one pointing to Eva.",
            "So how does this problem look like if you?"

        [
            "To formalize it using a dig up from the group.",
            "Framework.",
            "Sodeco has three main ingredients, one variables, second one is the domains of the variables and then constraints.",
            "So variables in this case, usually in a target tracking application, the variables represents the sensors, so in this case you have three variables T1T2 and T3.",
            "That represents the camera, the domain of the variables represents what the camera can do.",
            "So in this case there will be 2 possible actions for each node, which is either look left or look right and then you have constraints.",
            "Constraints are probably the most interesting part of the D Cup because they encode knowledge about your domain and in this particular case you have a constraint.",
            "Between two cameras, if their field of view overlap, so you have constrained between T1 and T2 constrained between T3 and T2C that notice that you don't have any constraint between T1 and T3, so they don't influence each other directly, so there's no constraint between them and also constrain relates to target.",
            "So for example, the constraint between T1 and T2 relates to diabolic and is going to give you basically a function that evaluates how well you are tracking their Bolick, and the unary constraint.",
            "Top there, which is the 143 is going to give you the performance measure for how well you're tracking Eva.",
            "OK, what you want to do at this point is just to maximize the sum of the constraints, because in this in this way you are maximizing the estimation of the position of all the targets in the scene."

        [
            "OK, now let's see a completely different problem which can still be modeled using the Cup which is meeting scheduling.",
            "Again, first question is why do we want to decentralize in this case?",
            "Well, we want to decentralize because of privacy, and I will explain this a bit more in detail in a moment.",
            "So imagine that you have these three agents, which probably you recognize.",
            "So we have Lucy, Charlie Brown and Shredder, and they want to do some activities together, but they want to divide in subsets, so for example, all of them want to play baseball together, but only Lucian Shredder likes to play piano together.",
            "Actually, Shredder is playing music, just attending and disturbing most of the time.",
            "But but still they do this activity together.",
            "So what you what you see here is that if you what they want to do is basically schedule these meetings.",
            "So there will be a window where the meeting can take place, for example from 1:00 to 8:00 PM they can play piano from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM.",
            "They can play baseball together and also Charlie Brown has a unary constraint, which is that he has to feed his dog, but he would like to do that after 6:00 PM.",
            "OK.",
            "So why do we want to decentralize in this case?",
            "Because if you send if you can provide a centralized solution, but what you need is that each of the agents will send to a central central mainframe.",
            "The meetings that they want to attend.",
            "So you have you lose privacy somehow, because for example, in this case, Charlie Brown doesn't need to know that losing Shredder are going to play piano together, because only agents involved in the meeting needs to negotiate about when the meeting is going to start OK."
        ],
        [
            "So.",
            "How does a D Cup formulation of this look like?",
            "Well, there are many different formulations that you can use.",
            "This one is usually referred to private event as variables.",
            "So in this case you have one variable for each event and for each agent that is participating in the event.",
            "OK so for example you have piano for loop for Shredder baseball for Shredder, Piano for Lucy, Baseball for Lucy, and each of these variable is representing the starting time of the particular event.",
            "OK, so of course you need somehow to.",
            "Relates event together and this is done using constraints.",
            "And these are the constraints that you're going to have in this in this case.",
            "So the there are now the interesting thing about this formulation is that there are two kinds of two kinds of constraints, hard constraints, which are constraints that have to be met.",
            "Otherwise the solution is simply invalid and then soft constraints, which encodes preferences of the agents.",
            "So for example, the constraint with Charlie Brown that he prefers to feed the dog after 6:00 PM.",
            "This is a soft constraint because he can do it before, but it would like to do that.",
            "6:00 PM while these constraints that relates the different events together, they are hard constraints, which effectively limits the set of solutions that you have for your problem.",
            "OK, and in particular, in this case, the dashed constraints, which relates events across agents.",
            "They are equal constraints, and this is pretty obvious if you look at the picture, because if Lucian Shredder wants to play piano together, they have to agree on the same time.",
            "OK, the other constraints, the one which is the intra agent constraint.",
            "These are not overlap constraint.",
            "Because of course if Shredder wants to play piano and play baseball, the two events should not overlap.",
            "OK, so in this way you see that you encode all the knowledge about the problem using these constraints.",
            "Then each of the variable will have particular range in which they can takes value.",
            "So this is the domain and then hopefully if you run your algorithm on this kind of problem.",
            "This is this is a possible solution that you're going to have, so they're going to play baseball at 4:00 PM then, so that after 2 hours this is 6:00 PM, and Lucy and Schroeder can play counter together at 7, and Charlie Brown is happy because you can fix his dog after 6:00 PM OK?"
