            "And what's the probability that they receive a response and we found that after becoming heavily engaged, those that will stay engaged long term over 50 days are almost twice as likely to receive response than those who will leave the core before 50 days."

        [
            "And then the other preferential treatment we noticed was in the response type of Members who are new to a group.",

            "So in this chart, the dark green bar on the long course side, those are.",

            "What's the probability they joined the core and it's not a huge drop, but it's definitely significant, and while it's easy to postulate why response rate might go up after you've been in a group for awhile, it's a little harder to explain why that would go down, and we don't really have an explanation for this phenomenon."
