            "You can notice that we have this switchable power and that which is controlled by the main sidebar.",
            "So we have different status of the graphical user interface.",
            "And we have a graphic sidebar that is always active and with this we are the quick setup for of a fluent visualization so we can turn off the edges faces and we can turn on and off the headlights.",
            "We can apply the overlay that is very useful.",
            "Overlay allow us when we do our graphical stuff to keep the previous layer of graphics so to have graphics super important.",
            "We can switch to perspective auto and we can enable picking that allow us to feed some field of the RBF morph graphical user interface directly using the mouse probe of fluid.",

            "Some kind of using display and apply.",
            "And the reachable panel is what change during the operation you will learn now out to set up a single shape modification.",
            "You remember we have several step.",
            "The first one is the set up and set up.",
            "A mainly is accomplished using these three panel and capsulation surfaces and points.",
            "I will show in details and we will play with that.",
            "Defeating of the RBF system that is, the stage in which all the source points are collected and the RBF solder is used to calculate the RBF positions that is invoked by using the solar panel and then once we have the solution computer that we can access to the preview it to them or panel.",
            "We can loop this setup so restarting several times and typically we will not restart from scratch because of some shape modification are quite similar, so it's enough to change just one field in one input to have the different result.",
            "Let's go ahead and this is the in capsulation panel we will have a chance to to see it in action.",
            "Let me comment that we have three kind of encapsulation that our domain.",
            "Moving and selection.",

            "I'm not sure that we will demonstrate it today.",
            "The domain and moving are very important in capsulation we can define as many of these we have here.",

            "So we can pick information, and for each one we have the set in motion.",
            "Here that allow us to prescribe several action to the pointer stuff extracted.",
            "Of course for some application.",
            "We can we need to control points movement on a point by point basis, so prescribing to each point what we want and we can do this in the points panel in which we can define as many points as we want.",
            "We can pick the point from the model with the mouse and then prescribe the movement to the individual point as an absolute movement was normal to the closest suface.",
            "Notice that this panel points.",
            "In it's the more flexible option that we have for RBF morph because we can define point everywhere onto surface in the space is not a problem.",
            "And we can read points from file so we can prepare the points, for instance with a different tool that are prescribing our morphing action and consider that even if it is, if it.",
            "If it's not covered today, we have also low level functions to read this points from darkly from very large file.",
            "In that case they will not go into this panel, but because if you have say 1 million points is not interesting to take it on a one by one basis.",
            "However, we can the option to to rate them.",
            "Here you can see the solar panel.",
            "They allow us to load and save a solution file that is 1 hour.",
            "Setup is completed, the RBF is OK.",
            "When we save the information, information stored can be used later for morphine and these two buttons are really very important.",
            "You will use it a lot of time.",
            "Source points and solution.",
            "This one search points will collect and gather all the information introducted.",
            "In the previous panel, say Ancop source of points, so all the routes to define RBF points are combined together.",
            "Solution will start the solver and here we have a description of the preview panel that allows us to see what happened to surface is with the current loaded solution and of course what is important is that is parametric so we can amplify 101.1234.",
            "It's up to you or we can even animate the amplification to understand.",
            "And disease the morph panel that allows us to update the overall safety mesh because the preview is just graphical to understand what's happening, the motion will move the volume mesh and it's important to understand what happening to the quality of the mesh.",
            "So about modeling guidelines I want to go quite fast on this because I prefer that you put your hands on the software.",
            "However, let me comment that when we have two moving something with mesh morphing.",
            "OK, the tool is powerful enough to handle very large or BF points.",
            "Data sets is not a problem.",
            "The real problem is out to select define.",
            "This points becausw.",
            "Of course.",

            "With something known then propagate the movement or move an edge.",
            "However, we need to be skilled at the in this practice because it's not so easy.",
            "Consider that if we follow the.",
            "The story of the software at the very beginning we will we have only the surface panel, so we we were just able to pick points on surface is.",
            "So tell the softer.",
            "OK I want that all the points that comes from this set of surface is will undergo a rigid movement that is a rotational of 1 degree around this axis.",
            "All these other will be fixed.",
            "All this one will move a meter up OK. Something like this.",
            "And of course, reading, movement, rotation, translation, dance, calling about arbitrary reference systems, we will see we will see together.",
            "And then more and more advanced shape modification for individual surface set.",
            "And this is a modeling basis on suitcases.",
            "We can use a morphing that is basically just an encapsulation surface.",
            "I don't know if anyone in the audience's experience with more for tool, As for instance, the more for true love Aransas culture and so on.",
            "They want based on deforming volumes no.",
            "OK, in that case.",
            "Typically you play with boxes that usually don't touch the geometry, so you try to do your morphing action working with volume.",
            "Say for instance, I want to move something that is a typical application and I want to deform all the volume surrounding.",
            "Volume mesh and put at zero.",
            "I can do this very simply because I can put using domain.",
            "I can put a box that is affixed box that tells the software OK.",
            "I will have a zero on the border of the box for the morphing field and I will touch just what is inside the box.",
            "Then I put inside another box.",
            "Of course smaller in which I prescribe a movement.",
            "The result will be that whatever is in the inner box will be moving according to what I have in the in the inner box.",
            "Whatever is in the intersection between the two domain will be the former.",
            "Using BPF we will see an example.",
            "An we can use just points.",
            "To move.",
            "Or we can combine for instance, in the first slide that you remember when I show you the upper face of the cube.",
            "I have used this service panel to extract the boundary, the upper boundary and tell the software I want to such boundary fixer.",
            "Then with the points panel I have just put a single point in the middle.",
            "So I have used information from the service panel and the points panel to shape the operator face.",
            "OK, let's stop with this because I don't want introduce too much complexity and let's go to put our hands.",

            "Together with the under format if you want for instance, you can do like this in the preview.",
            "This is not so meaningful.",
            "So if you switch off faces.",

            "OK, the preview panel allow you to show you what is currently saved in the RBF solution.",
            "That may be a single solution on a multi solution.",
            "We will.",
            "I will show you in the left you have a previous your face so you will see what your face will undergo the preview action.",
            "So the effect of the morphing on the right side you will have the original surface.",

            "And here we can change the amplification of what we see.",
            "So let me for instance increase to 0.5.",
            "Let me preview again and so you can see a larger effect.",
            "Let me shoot down this one and restore the preview of.",
            "At this OK an.",
            "As you can notice with, if we change the amplification, we will change the movement.",
            "And we may be interested to see, for instance, several value, so we can, for instance, insert list of value.",
            "So like this.",
            "So minus one.",
            "Sorry, this is meaningless.",
            "Means .50, zero, .51 plus in it and we will have a sequence and the sequence allows us to do an animation of the morphing action.",
            "OK. Let's try to do to play with this animation.",
            "I will give you another hint.",
            "The sequence accept also the keyword range.",
            "First value, last value number of intervals.",
            "I'm using 11 and press in it and so I will have automatically generated this sequence so that I have smoother and emission of the effect.",
            "OK, are you able to play with this preview?",
            "No, no, no.",
            "We need help.",
            "Review, answer and do we do?",
            "I feel which bothers activated.",
            "You haven't had buttons.",
            "You cannot, yes if they are disabled, it means that you haven't a current solution.",
            "That is the current solution.",
            "Maybe all loaded from file or calculated on on the fly.",
            "So going to solve a panel go in the solar panel like this.",
            "Press the source points button.",
            "You get this number at the end.",
            "Pressdisplay points can you see the points.",
            "Yeah OK press the solution.",
            "This will enable the RBF morph solution.",
            "OK, you have now going to the preview panel and you will see that preview will be enabled.",
            "Yes.",
            "OK, of course there all the preview and morph tune are disabled.",
            "If you haven't an active solution and each modification after the solution will put the software in an unsolved state so you haven't, you will have disabled several feature OK. What's the meaning of the ice and snow?",
            "The meanings of.",
            "For reset the DX OK, the rigid movement yeah OK. Let me comment a little bit as I introduce it.",
            "What we want is to have a parametric measure, continuously parametric, so we want to define a baseline modification and then can amplify this and I will show you very soon that this is true even for non linear shape modification.",
            "For instance, if we rotate the Cooper, we do it right now by 10 degree and we put the amplification to what we expect is a 20 degree.",
            "OK, this is not a straightforward because the rotational operator is not linear.",
            "However, it will work because it's implemented to work with the rotation and to properly under under the rotation.",
            "So let me first conclude this and then.",
            "Sorry.",
            "Are you making?",
            "No.",
            "Unfortunately, the animation is not comes not with.",
            "Um?",
            "Time synchronization, so typically you set up.",
            "And then a unique you expect playing with this button that is allow you to change the effect.",
            "But usually are not so fast because.",
            "If you play with large model you will have not this very fast output, so This is why our concern was not to slow down this, because usually it's not so fast and let me add, however, I prefer to finish the answer so we are looking for a parametric solution so we have the final query simple shape modification because we have 1 meter translation as baseline.",
            "So if I put 3.",
            "It will mean 3 meters.",
            "If I put minutes .25 it will be used up to five meters.",
            "Of course it's up to me to find a baseline that is meaningful for me.",
            "For instance, I could use as baseline 0.7.",
            "However, it's not a soul.",
            "Smart choice to have something to be amplified.",
            "So typically we have two strategy.",
            "That is, we put their amplification at its maximum allowable value.",
            "Say that in my problem I know that I want to know in the range I want to move in the range .25 minutes down to five.",
            "I put this as baseline and my amplification is something minus one to one, so minus 100%.",
            "100% of the extent this is a typical choice and other typical choices that I use.",
            "Baseline that is meaningful 1 millimeter 1 meter, so that when I put my amplification my 2.5 will means 2.5 meters and it's similar for the angle.",
            "So typically I will do as baseline 1 degree or stand degree so that I have a clear link between the parameter that I use and the result because consider that when I will use in a batch and so I will be blind.",
            "With respect to the implementation, I will have just the name of the modification and amplification.",
            "So typically I will save move X1 meter in the name so that I am aware that if I put 1.2 I will have one doctor meters OK. And another important information, let me comment all of you able to do this initial animation.",
            "OK, so when you deal with animation and you do sexy animation, especially if you want to sell a product, consider that animation was born in the past, mainly for marketing reasons, because because competitors had an emissions and we haven't so we decided to put this feature and to have this feature working the best is that you want to save your animation so.",
            "If you press here the setup button you will have this setup of fluent output to picture, so usually I prefer to go to the PNG format.",
            "Anne then.",
            "I switch off white background, but of course this is up to me.",
            "I press apply and close and then I hear put a base name.",
            "Say we wanna use move.",
            "Venus X OK and then I press save.",
            "OK, if you go to the folder that is.",
            "This one.",

            "Is that a shared with you on any mission so that you are we are focused and we are convinced that we are on the right track, so doing animation is not just a matter of marketing, but it's really very, very important when you are morphing and moving something, consider that almost all the animation that you see in my presentation was generated using this an.",
            "If you want there are here I'm controlling this caption.",
            "So you can see the amplification.",
            "In that case.",
            "OK, and if you want you can even customize what you have here, but this is fluent stuff.",
            "Typical fluent stuff.",
            "However, we have a just produces the graphics, but nothing meaningful too much morphine because I forgot the most important point that here in the solar panel now I'm ready to save pressing move minus X and so to write my solution.",

            "Right now you if you go to the solver panel in the solar panel you have this file solution file OK. Read the writing is disabled.",
            "Maybe that you haven't calculated solution.",
            "So in this case press search points and solution again and then you will be able to save when you press.",
            "If you press again you will be alerted that you are overwriting OK and I will write is not a problem at all.",
            "Let me comment the different meaning of the config panel and the solve panel.",
            "Here in the config panel you have the option to read a configuration file or to save a configuration file.",
            "The configuration file I will show it is this.",
            "There are the dot RBF.",
            "This is a file, an ASCII file.",
            "You can have a look if you want.",
            "We can do it together.",
            "Um?",
            "OK, and here you have all the RBF more variable that are used in your setup and what is good.",
            "Sometimes it could be useful to automate some setup, just picking this fight for instance so there is.",
            "A company that has defined at a very powerful automated workflow in which they said come and of Linux is used to Patch the PBF file so that it once you have a template setup, you haven't to tweak the graphical user interface but you just Patch this file because all the information there are in the graphical user interface are stored here.",
            "OK, so if you change this and you reload, you will disagree informational.",
            "Weighted accordingly an is very useful to save the configuration file because for instance if I'm playing with the long set up in which there are a lot of points involved, right and the press solution button takes say 20 minutes, 30 minutes to fit is wise to 1st save the configuration file because the configuration file allow me to restart their in store this setup active.",
            "When I go in the solution partner in the solar panel and I load a solution file, I will not only restore the setup, but I will also restore the solution that is stored on the solution file and put our beer for morphine assaulted status.",
            "That is capable to produce more, and so on.",
            "OK, so we have started the file and we have preview it.",
            "We're so an animation of a single shape modifier, we learn a lot of things, but actually we didn't much more fee.",
            "That is what we are here for, so let's try to move this cube OK.",
            "So two more for the cube we have to go in the morph panel.",
            "That is the right place to do more, so let's first refresh the graphic using the display button.",
            "An switch off everything and let's switch on just cube and ground and press display as you can notice they the on the fly graphics of the preview is just graphics and you can see that the fluent model is in there.",
            "We have attached the image right now.",
            "And now we want to move it.",
            "Of course, typically we will not move during an interface graphical session, but we can do and to do it we have an approach that is similar to the produce, so we can define an amplification if we enable this auto refresh at the end of the operation, the graphical viewport will be refreshed so that we will see.",
            "The the fact otherwise we'd like to refresh memory.",
            "Of course, this is by default this tablet because especially if you play with very, very large model, you may be interested in the morphing output as much quality, but you do, you do wanna.",
            "Stick on the graphical interface to wait for the refresh.",
            "In this case, the model is very small, so we have no problem and just repress the morph button like this.",
            "And weight, of course this morphing operation May takes along along the time becausde the RBF function that we have computed is used on all different of the mesh.",
            "And if we are in parallel, this is active even in parallel, even with the graphical user interface.",
            "This operation will be faster becausw each partition will move its own North OK, at the end we have moved the cube and now we have as you can notice, the CFD mesh in an updated position.",
            "If you have a look to the text output, you can see that.",
            "Then fluent, print out what's going on for the quality of the mesh and you have a flag on the maximum cell skewness.",
            "Of course we can go back with the undo button.",
            "And bring back the mesh to the original position so you can play as many times as you want.",
            "With this say let's try to use a 2 for the amplification.",
            "Let's try to destroy this mesh.",
            "Not enough go back.",
            "I will make it.",
            "A little bit more.",
            "Oh, finally we have failed to mesh.",
            "OK this message update dynamic mesh file failure negative volume is something that you have to be.",
            "Use it to see, because typically, especially for industrial application in which the setup of the mesh Morefield problem is challenging.",
            "The quality of the Morford measure may be a problem, and maybe that negative volumes appear, so it's really important to that the software is safe with respect to this, but not just safe that allow you to understand where is the problem.",
            "Of course, here is easy to understand where is.",
            "However, for very large stuff it absent, for instance there from for some stupid input in.",
            "Set up, you have just one Note 1 cell that fails because for instance it fails at an intersection between two end caps OK, and so you have these mega ball button that allow you to show with red dots where negative volumes are generated and then do is safe even with a failed mesh.",
            "So if you go back you will have not problem.",
            "OK.",
            "So with this we have almost completed all the stuff required for shape, set up a single shape modification and so to have the mesh parametric with respect to one parameter of very simple one.",
            "But now you have a clear picture of almost everything that you can do.",
            "Of course now we can play with this and try to define more complex shape modifications.",
            "Moving something is not so useful.",
            "And so before going on with the next step, I want to be double sure that all of you are fine with this first.",
            "Application and if the big picture is clear, because this is really important, I do sit up.",
            "I placed at points but at the end the target is to define the dark soul and daughter be a file that can be used for parallel morphine.",
            "I have.",
            "We can also try to start fluent parallel.",
            "I don't know if we have licenses to play with these.",
            "However the next steps.",
            "Will be defined another shape modification and see a multi parametric mesh so at least with two parameters OK can I go home?",
            "OK, so to go ahead we now do something really very simple.",
            "We have moved this cube.",
            "Now we can.",
            "Try to rotate OK and so I want to rotate the cube about its central axis.",
            "The problem is that I don't know where the central axis is OK.",
            "If I have the card, maybe that I know where is the axis.",
            "However the problem we have defined at this software is that if you are playing it just with the measure you have the need to extract geometrical information.",
            "So what we can do is that we put in the display.",
            "Viewport just a cube like this.",
            "OK, we rescale so that we have.",
            "And we want this point.",
            "This middle point.",
            "We want to know where this point is a lot up, and then I'm sorry in Italian.",
            "And then if we go in the truth panel, we have this convenient tool that is the distance between two points.",
            "It's really simple, but fluent comes without this and if you press by mouse you can with the right button pick this corner and then this corner and you can see the location of the midpoint.",
            "Here M that is 3.5.",
            "Two .5 one OK.",
            "If I wanted this information, I can.",
            "Copy and paste directly from the text output if I want.",
            "So what we do simply now, just we go in the set M panel, restored to zero that X.",
            "And define the baseline, maybe 1 degree or 10 degree, then great degree for training is better because it's easy to see.",
            "And then I will define the axis that is.",
            "I have already forgot three 3.5.",
            "2.5.",
            "1.",
            "3.5.",
            "2.5 two.",
            "And then press set and display access.",
            "OK, I got it.",
            "OK, are you able to define the axis in a similar fashion?",
            "And don't forget to switch this to 0 because because notice that now we are not starting from scratch, but we are defined the second shape modification.",
            "Simply changing the information in the set motion pattern.",
            "OK. Now if you press final lights and display points.",
            "And preview points.",
            "You will see something like this.",
            "Let me restore also the ground.",
            "OK. Are you all fine with this?",
            "OK, so now I go back to the salt final.",
            "I press search points.",
            "I press solution.",
            "I wait, then I directly press right, rotate that.",
            "Where is that here and right right out OK?",
            "Oh OK, I forgot to preview.",
            "Let me preview.",
            "OK.",
            "This is a 20 degree preview.",
            "If I use the range variable here you can see what's happening, what's going on?",
            "Let's try to it's.",
            "Let's try to do.",
            "It's 10 degree so meaning 66 means 60 degree.",
            "OK. Now this is how the rotation is propagated.",
            "OK, are you able to play with this?",
            "No.",
            "No yes OK. Is someone need help please?",
            "Price and and OK we can go ahead and so notice.",
            "Another interesting feature because during the preview we are.",
            "We are concerned of what is the effect of morphine on the volume.",
            "And the preview can operate also on the mesh cut like this.",
            "Have a look.",
            "Here you can notice.",
            "What happen inside the mesh?",
            "And this is useful.",
            "This cutter not so helpful for this shape modification.",
            "Let me load back.",
            "They move X simply in the solution file.",
            "Move X rayed OK. Go in the preview.",
            "Review and select the cutting plane and preview the result.",
            "As you can notice, this is very useful to understand what's happening inside the mesh OK.",
            "So.",
            "All these machinery.",
            "So for this setup I have to work one shape, one modification.",
            "On a single sheet for modification, however, I can see this modification.",
            "Furthermore, I may be interested to preview what is the effect if I superimpose several modification, because it's what I will have during the my CFD calculation because I want to do.",
            "Shape parametric model with respect to as many shape parameters they want.",
            "OK, so we have already 2 parameters.",
            "All of you a stored.",
            "Rotate that and move X so I will show you how to do it.",
            "We simply go in the multi solution panel that allowing me.",
            "If I I have to activate the multi solution option the default is DoD and I select two solution by enabling the first 2.",
            "I write the name move X. Rotate that.",
            "That OK?",
            "Then if I press the set button, what will happen is that RBF morph will look for the solution file.",
            "I haven't error because I have correctly pressed the name and as an output there is a lot of output I receive.",
            "Also, honey int the hint is OK if you want to do in batch this action.",
            "Try this multi solution that is this multi solution with one and one.",
            "You will use this comment.",
            "The comment is RBF morph.",
            "This is the beginning of a list according to scheme language that is used for the automation of fluent and then I have the 1st.",
            "The item out the list that is another sublist of two items in which I have the name move X without extension and amplification.",
            "The second one rotated that and the amplification.",
            "Of course I can play with amplification as much as I want.",
            "So let's for instance put this to zero and press preview.",
            "I will have the preview of this move X.",
            "Let me just go in the preview panel, set it, press preview.",
            "Notice that now the preview panel in the solution name Field, this one you haven't today name of current solution, but you have the multi solar switch because it means that now TBF amorpha is in a multi solution operating condition so the information are not gathered by this single reading but are driven by this.",
            "OK, Ann.",
            "You can play for instance test .2.",
            "Press means one.",
            "Press 2.",
            "So you can notice that we have things to do with their global effects.",
            "OK, so we are combining two shape modification together that operate on the same area and the produce a different effect.",
            "One is displacing the cube, the other one is rotating the cube.",
            "They are properly superimposed OK and with this status of preview notice that in the preview I have now different caption in which I have not just one amplification about I have.",
            "A182 because I have the amplification of the 1st and the 2nd shape here.",
            "So this is a you can keep this in the caption when you when you generate an output.",

            "So I will.",
            "Show you that we can use the N Cup.",
            "To act as a selection tool so that we select just a part of the domain.",
            "In this case I will use an anchor up that is a smaller cube with the outside option.",

            "From a side view you can clearly see that you are absolutely on the STL's face.",
            "OK.",
            "So what happened that with this setup when I sold?",

            "For instance we at the project about about the simulation of art emptying the human heart.",
            "So it's really very complex geometry.",
            "We have the STL target for the time in history, so having a way to cross blend between the different shapes that are not a different time frames may be very important.",
            "This is a very simple example but allow you to move from the 20 to 30.",
            "Say for instance we can put us in the middle like this.",
            "OK, and let me show you another feature that we have in the preview panel.",
            "Let me first present this setup.",
            "That is, I have prepared here by hand.",
            "This file I will show you.",
            "This is a audio file of RBF morph in which you can prescribe as many file as you want and how many points as you want and amplification.",
            "As you can notice, we are assuming is always one and we are cross blending.",
            "These two shape modifications.",
            "OK, I have a comment in the preview that allowed to do a multiple preview with this.",
            "The name was.",
            "Fill it.",
            "OK, the keyword delete means that in the preview I will not have one single application or the current multi salt butter programming sequence of superposition.",
            "Like this?",
            "I have nothing to see, so.",
            "You can notice that we are continuously changing.",
            "The fillet radius of course they want and value with the exact because was one target.",
            "The last one.",
            "Is this the six is excellent.",
            "But we are smoothly changing the radius between the two days.",
            "OK, this is an advanced use of mesh morphing in which the multi solution is not used just to combine different shape, but to have an answer the result dissolution.",
            "So.",
            "I have completed this second example.",
            "Of course I have a lot of material, but I think that.",
            "We are running out of time so.",

            "This is this is really challenging to do.",
            "It takes one month without and of course the great benefit of morphing is that you can have parametric shape and so one to one mapping so without noise, but several advantages not only with tax measure that as easy to manage, but even with vybrid mash complex meshes OK an IK as a footer comment about.",
            "This kind of mesh I can assure.",
            "You that usually this kind of mesh, especially the one used for aeronautics.",
            "The problem is the weight class and you usually have a very very small elements near the surface an what's happen.",
            "But this is true even for a hybrid mesh because you have boundary layers.",
            "Is that after morphing, considering that usually you control two phase.",
            "What happened is that the boundary layer and the elements around this whole face, even if the format preserve almost the same aspect ratio.",
            "So typically the Y plus is very, very well preserved.",
            "If you remember the animation in 2D about ice accretion.",

            "However, it's just a matter of move notes.",

            "Just we didn't, but you can do it.",
            "I mean, currently if you want to go out of fluent, you can go almost everywhere.",
            "If you're especially if you are pushing shape optimization because it's just a matter of moving notes.",
            "So for instance, we can act at file level even in parallel to move notes where are stored or if possible to put the library inside.",

            "However we are still able.",
            "I think to build the 6.3.",
            "If someone asked, however, we have not limited.",
            "Of course there are some advanced features that are not enabled with old version because are not supported by fluent.",
