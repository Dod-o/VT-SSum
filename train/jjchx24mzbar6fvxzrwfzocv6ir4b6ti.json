            "And."
        ],
        [
            "Yeah, so I have prepared.",
            "Very short presentation is small motivation, so why we're doing this then?",
            "I remain functionalities and then I will try to show you the software on the on the on the laptop here.",
            "OK."
        ],
        [
            "So let's start with a little motivation, and since most of you are not doing too much with multimedia data, I thought it might be good to start with multimedia data mining and and what video understand under this term.",
            "So it is obviously good here that we get the common vocabulary.",
            "So all starts of course with data.",
            "Yeah, so for example, you're having now lots of lectures, so you have a lot of video data in this case also.",
            "Of course a lot of audio tater and you have also presentations, so you have already.",
            "A lot of multimedia data, yeah.",
            "The next thing you want of course to do is you have to to analyze it somehow and like you generate.",
            "Usually something like this which is meta data.",
            "Is Peter just explained and indexes?",
            "Yeah, the idea is that this may create an index is of course very small in comparison to this one.",
            "Yeah, so otherwise you wouldn't do it and why you're doing it because you want to search on this, right?",
            "So this is the second step in multi meter data mining.",
            "You have something you want to analyze.",
            "You have.",
            "Of course I was in the other part which is searching, which is completely different, which is a new challenge.",
            "Yeah, so you should never underestimate analyze this one thing.",
            "Searching in India test which have 128 dimensions is also big challenge.",
            "So this is not something which is a trivial thing, especially not if you're talking of content based search.",
            "So I'm always talking on visual search now and not on real text search.",
            "Yeah, and another thing which is very important in many people forget especially with visual searches.",
            "You have also to properly visualize results.",
            "Also, Peter showed some interfaces already, so The thing is, if you find a lot of video items, yeah, it's not so easy to charge his results.",
            "Yeah, so imagine if you're searching in your video lecture database and you get back, let's say 50 hits.",
            "You get back 50 videos each video, I estimate, is about one hour.",
            "So how do you charge this is the right one or not, right?",
            "So you need some some kind of very clever visualization that you can charge it very fast.",
            "This is the result you were looking for, right?",
            "And Peter showed one example, which is a video summary where he has a stripe image in there we have keyframes in there where we see camera movements and so on.",
            "So it's something that you get very fast and it here in one screen.",
            "What's to be about without having to play one hour to see?",
            "That's the one or not, yeah?"
        ],
        [
            "OK, that's the common picture.",
            "I want to concentrate of course on on the search partner, because we're talking about a video browsing tool, and even if you talking about search, they usually 2 two kinds of search of ways you're going to search, right?",
            "One thing is, I mean it's of course the same as in the text area that you use some kind of query based search here and the other thing is that use browsing.",
            "The office difference is that in the query based search, the user normally knows what he's looking for or has a very clear picture in minds what he's looking for and he can formulate queries in the text search.",
            "You give keywords.",
            "In there you formulates queries and you try to refine your search.",
            "The same is of course true with.",
            "Search here so you should you start different image here.",
            "Yeah, you say this is an image and give me all content which is similar to this image.",
            "So this will be the.",
            "The thing then, when you're thinking in visual terms, right?",
            "The other thing is if if you want to get an overview of your material, this is a different kind of search.",
            "And again I'm talking here of visual browsing.",
            "Yeah, The thing is that.",
            "The user does not exactly know what he's looking for, but he wants to get in the dear what's inside this material?",
            "Yeah, could be one use case.",
            "The other use case could be that there is definitely no metadata replied.",
            "So imagine you have a big collection of video.",
            "Data were simply no real information is attached to, so you have only like at home you're 100 VHS cassettes.",
            "Yeah, maybe you have written something on the labor.",
            "Maybe most people do not.",
            "And of course you do not annotate, so if there are three or five or six films in it, I'm sure you will not write 10 pages.",
            "What's what's on there?",
            "Yeah, and then of course you have a problem because you you don't know what simply don't know what's on there.",
            "OK."
        ],
        [
            "Video browsing tool is the name already says of course.",
            "Focuses on on the second approach and on browsing approach.",
            "And here it shows a little bit how it typical workflow works.",
            "So first you start with the entire set, so this is obviously the first thing, and then we introduce some kind of clustering so you you can for example cluster for a certain feature.",
            "I will tell you in the next slide which features we have currently there and then the software selects the representative items, sorts them, and visualizes them right.",
            "And then either you're very lucky and you already see your relevant item.",
            "Or you.",
            "Cluster again, maybe by a different feature, because this one was not successful.",
            "Or you can also select one of the clusters and refine your search within this cluster.",
            "So it's quite the same approach as you're using in text.",
            "So usually we start with Google, maybe with freaky words.",
            "Then you get 1,000,000 results.",
            "Then you're typing maybe five to six more keywords and so you're getting smaller and smaller.",
            "Usually Google you cannot select subset here, so it's always searching in the entire base, which is normally not what you want.",
            "Yeah, and you just repeat this this this algorithm until you find your relevant item or items, and then you put them to to some kind of result set for further processing.",
            "Whatever this would be in our cases, it's most time that you go for video editing that you go to a nonlinear editing system or something like this.",
            "Yeah, so you should deal searching for things they can reuse in other productions.",
            "'cause production is usually very expensive thing and if you can reuse things, it's very very good for them."
        ],
        [
            "Right, yeah?",
            "So those are their clustering features implemented so far in our tool, so most of them Peter also introduced in his presentation.",
            "I won't say too much about them.",
            "Camera motion.",
            "We heard already motion activity.",
            "It's on how much is going on within the images.",
            "Is is it very static image or is he doing a lot of movements here so this motion TV audio level?",
            "I think it's very clear color similarity will group images according to their global color distribution.",
            "Which can help, but here you have to be a little bit creative for sports games.",
            "For example, would use this because in soccer games usually you have to Greenfield so you can get if you have material on sports games and other things, you can usually group this very well.",
            "Faces, of course, is an obvious thing, and what we will include very soon is some kind of setting detection.",
            "Um?",
            "And setting it actually mean that he wants to detect locations again their locations by object.",
            "So we're using here some some kind of object similarity in there.",
            "So you want to detect certain objects and if the scene is again on the same location, let's say again in this room, but from a different angle we want to say it's again in this room.",
            "This helps you of course.",
            "Again, do cluster your your material right.",
            "OK, and of course the tool is open so you can include whatever you want, but currently we."
        ],
        [
            "This this kind of features.",
            "OK Sir.",
            "I will try now to show you this thing also.",
            "After this I have to sit down.",
            "It's not a big thing.",
            "Oops, that's not the tour.",
            "That's the tour.",
            "OK.",
            "So this is when you enter the tool.",
            "So I've I've used here the track data set, so maybe some of you are familiar with this yearly contest, which is originally coming from the text domain and the track width viruses, not video domain, and they usually give you a lot of video data in this kind of example there rushes, so those are.",
            "This is material which is very often done under the same scene because something was going wrong.",
            "Yeah, so maybe they wanted to do film the guard in front of the of the Queen's Palace and the car was going by or something like this.",
            "So they are taking very often this the same setting.",
            "Again yeah.",
            "And the other thing is that this material was completely unannotated, so you have to imagine you have hundreds and thousands of items you have no annotations and you want to find your something again.",
            "Yeah, and that's of course very good.",
            "Free assumption for a tour and yeah, so first you see all segments.",
            "It's not very interesting but you can do here is you can zoom in and come out so you can get and brief overview.",
            "But what is much more interesting is that you can now apply some some kind of clustering, right?",
            "So I will just apply now some.",
            "Some clustering in here.",
            "The first one we can apply, of course is, let's say, camera movement.",
            "And it's not working on my little laptop, which is not the fastest one, so it's one.",
            "Yes.",
            "That's why there.",
            "I can combine if I select the subset, so I will.",
            "I will, so you mean you're applying to at once.",
            "OK, this is something we do not have implemented so far.",
            "It could be used for your idea.",
            "That's a good idea.",
            "Yeah, no, we didn't do.",
            "It is so far so currently.",
            "Yeah, you can do it.",
            "So kindly we apply only one.",
            "Of course, it's also some it may be.",
            "Little bit confusing for the user because if you for example cluster for color similarity and faces, what would be the result?",
            "So it's it's also I'm just thinking now, So what would you expect?",
            "And as a result, so faces with similar color?",
            "Need some semantic meaning for that.",
            "Yeah you need some some idea about what is meant.",
            "If you for example, combine camera movements with motion activity.",
            "Right so here for example, you have now, so I make it bigger now so that you can also see it.",
            "You have a cluster with zoom in right and if you casted for example so mean and motion activity then.",
            "So you need some some some master feature you know, so you can first cluster made.",
            "Let's say the camera motion and within those classes you can cluster them by motion activity.",
            "But I think it doesn't make sense to make it in parallel.",
            "Try to use a feature to produce.",
            "Separation based on that feature.",
            "In this case camera we after some results we have.",
            "Four clusters.",
            "Is it clears meaning the one is also that one is old shops with spend right?",
            "Then you can go on.",
            "You could combine several features.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So you have to give it some labor, right?",
            "Zooming out faces.",
            "No, that's that's for sure.",
            "Possibly that's why.",
            "Let's see can hear yeah here, for example you have.",
            "Pen left.",
            "What else you can see if you if I keep my mouse over there you get some kind of preview, So what you see here is?",
            "I mean this is the current keyframe and you see here keyframes which are in the past and some which are in the future.",
            "So you get a very.",
            "The middle.",
            "Yes, yeah, this is the middle one.",
            "The middle one is I selected there and this is what he shows when I go over.",
            "Yes, yeah, right yeah, exactly of one shot, yeah.",
            "The shot is I can just show it so it's.",
            "This one I think is.",
            "34 seconds so you can see here so it's from zero to 34 and there should also be some very pen left, hopefully.",
            "Yeah yeah, yeah.",
            "It's a very long shot, Sir.",
            "But this is a typical Russia, so they are filming things again and again and again.",
            "And.",
            "This is maybe.",
            "Something you're looking for, boobs.",
            "OK, let's apply a second one thing here so.",
            "Example, I can do not all your power since I make dinner.",
            "Third one because I want to show you another feature of the tool there indeed some kinds of new classes here.",
            "Singer third one is then maybe for color similarity if I can find it.",
            "Color layout here.",
            "This takes a bit longer.",
            "OK, so let's see.",
            "Here.",
            "As you see now, with color similarity groups together some images which are some somehow similar in color, not in objects but in color, so this is.",
            "Those obviously are in encourage the same, so they are.",
            "Group together.",
            "So this is always something we have to explain, so it's really only on color based.",
            "It's not based on the content of the image, right?",
            "So this is much more difficult of course.",
            "So what else can you see now?",
            "Because I have class ready three times.",
            "You see here is some kind of history.",
            "So in in case.",
            "You want.",
            "To go back here, yes, you see are all steps you applied.",
            "You just click back on the on the history and you come.",
            "Back to your first step.",
            "We did.",
            "And of course you can apply it in different steps there.",
            "So what I can do now is.",
            "I can say I select now.",
            "Let's say this faster and.",
            "This cluster.",
            "And they say something like reduce selection.",
            "Oops.",
            "Select them all.",
            "Send this and reduce.",
            "Not really.",
            "Still calculating.",
            "Yeah, OK, so now we have only two of the clusters left as you see, yeah.",
            "And you can apply here on the reduced set now again.",
            "Uh, the same algorithms, right?",
            "So I can apply here for example now.",
            "Can do again, the reduced selection.",
            "OK. And I can do now, let's say.",
            "The color layout again.",
            "Which wheels?",
            "In your work, you're not using any.",
            "Information, except for loudness only to loudness here.",
            "Exactly, no, we're not, so this is not a color similarity match.",
            "You're not using there, that's why there you're not using the speech recognition.",
            "This will be also possibility.",
            "We're only using the loudness of the signal, right?",
            "What you can do as well is that you say show all segments.",
            "Now, if you're very sure you have find one segment, you can see in all of their of the keyframes which are contained in this in this segment.",
            "And finally, if you're.",
            "If you're very sure that.",
            "You find yourself in there.",
            "Let's see.",
            "You should be able to drop them out so there is some kind of result list in there.",
            "So you can take now certain items so you can just take them out here and you can organize here.",
            "As you like, the order is important because you can can generate here in EDL.",
            "Is this little icon here?",
            "So it generates you some some kind of 1 video out of this three, let's say yeah.",
            "So this is actually then the real interface which goes on the outside.",
            "Yeah, so this will be the place where you say this this and this item I have found in my huge set and then wants to put it to further processing step right?",
            "So for example to a nonlinear editing system or whatever you want.",
            "27 again, but here is just.",
            "A huge amount of videos.",
            "Which means you should be using.",
            "Pick two here, but we are not restricted to any format here.",
            "So are all algorithms are former independent and we are relying on some kind of mdata.",
            "We call it so we have a library which is makes this format independent and we're working with Direct show DirectX, so we're using the Windows encoding filters to treat this forwards, and the algorithms are completely format independent.",
            "As Peter says, we're working in uncompressed domain, so you're working then frame based.",
            "And then of course, it's first analyzed, so the features are extracted, and then the two users, of course is this extraction and uses the in this case.",
            "Of course in MX7, file to to get the features and then the sort by then.",
            "So this is the basic idea and the real good thing is that you do not need any annotations associated to the material so far, so this material is really completely unannotated, and otherwise you wouldn't have any chance to find here.",
            "Only a single item.",
            "OK.",
            "I think it's Kabbalah.",
            "Yeah, if you have.",
            "Yeah, sure.",
            "Are there any real users already?",
            "Yes, so this tool is incorporated, so we're working together here with a company in Hanover.",
            "It's called DBZ and they have a software which is called Spicer.",
            "So they're selling on the one side hardware and then the other side software.",
            "So the hardware is storage for video material and the software is for managing videos in a distributed environment and as a part of this tool.",
            "This video browsing tool is currently integrated and Dan shall be used there, so it's not in commercial use so far, but we're in the status that is integrated there.",
            "And that's also why it.",
            "It looks like this special design.",
            "Yeah, it's all other interfaces look quite different, But this one looks in the special design, which is actually the outlook also of this Spicer tool, so that's why it's all kept in this black, and it has this fancy buttons which are in little bit funny, but it's it's a design of this other tool.",
            "And yeah, so they're using it there, which is very helpful in in case you have a lot of unannotated material and you want to browse in there.",
            "So that's really helpful.",
            "You also use Epic Seven in the meantime, so that's.",
            "But we worked together with them in.",
            "Two in the second project now, so we have one easy project which finishes now in the second one which just started one year ago and we're still continuing this this thing.",
            "OK. Any other questions?",
