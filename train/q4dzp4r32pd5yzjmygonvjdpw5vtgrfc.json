            "I took the amount of mass, so here there is mass a half and I divided it by the length of this interval.",

            "So what you can choose is you can say, well, these are the maximal intersections that get positive mass.",
            "And now in the lower bound I put the mass in the upper right corners of those maximal intersections as far away as possible from the origin and you see that that here the Gray values change right from the right upper corner.",
            "In this one the upper bound I put it in the lower left corner as close as possible to the origin.",
            "So you can specify that you can do marginal CDF plots also, and then you can plot the lower and upper bound at the same time, so the lower bound is the this one and upper bound.",
            "Is there also?",
            "No, but of course 3 dimensional plot is maybe nicer, so here.",
            "Is a 3 dimensional version using this RGL package.",
            "And then you can also turn it around and get a better view of how the.",
            "Data looks.",
            "Well, now I want to show a little bit bigger example.",
            "This is a data set of size 1000.",
            "And then the Emily needs a little time to compute, so it's computing now.",
            "And you will see that we now get about 15,000 maximal intersections.",
            "So it doesn't take long to find those maximal intersections, but to solve the optimization problem does take a little bit.",
            "So.",
            "Question yes.",
            "Unique how do you break the does it?",
            "Is it part of the output that is unique or not?",
            "No so I can deal with this first type of non uniqueness with this upper and lower bound.",
            "The second type of non uniqueness.",
            "I've not dealt with that yet.",
            "And that is.",
            "Yeah, it's not very easy problem to solve.",
            "I think you can say, for example, if the click matrix has rank M, you know it's unique, so there are some easy sufficient conditions for uniqueness, but there are not so easy necessary and sufficient conditions for uniqueness.",

            "We have our output.",
            "So we see it converge.",

            "And that's a very typical property of the Emily for these types of problems.",
            "So we can plot this.",
            "So first, these are all the maximal intersections that may get positive mass, so these are all the 15,000 or 14,406.",
            "The ones that do get positive mass in the end.",
            "Um?",
            "Where are they?",
            "Those are only this one, so it's they're very small.",
            "But these are the 55 to get positive mass, so you see here that this first type of non uniqueness that you don't know where to put the mass inside these regions is not so important because the regions are very small.",
            "But there's other types of nonuniqueness I did not deal with yet.",
            "OK, we can plot the.",
            "Bivariate CDF, for example, in a grayscale image you can use different color scheme if you like.",
            "The 3D plot looks a little nicer.",
