            "If we need to.",
            "I think our infrastructure is flexible enough that we can add that basically the target could be an expression.",

            "Surprisingly well in this application domain OK, and at this scale I mean really realized for the large part we're talking about huge ontologies.",
            "It's hard enough to do this one to one mappings and then for the ontologies that are very expressive.",
            "So in some cases it's sort of addressed on the ontology side.",
            "You could think of this.",
            "You know if you really want some complex concept here, just create that concept.",

            "I would say for 120 ontologies you said, yeah, it's pretty small number.",

            "OK, but you anticipate that there could be many.",
            "If yeah, we, I mean our because we use the same store that we use for the ontologies.",

            "So if you use so if you give us a mapping that uses our equivalent offer, uses any other you know well defined relation will store it, and then when we give it to you, if you want to use it in an algorithm will give to that that relation to you.",
            "It just so happens that much of the data that we get in much of the mappings that we get.",
