            "So I mean this is roadmapping when we're 2029.",
            "I can stop being even more visionary, interpret four DTV and stuff, But then 2014.",
            "So what I would say is maybe at least the goal could be that in five years that the the research community in semantic multimedia, thanks in part to the large amount of funding from the EU, large amount of projects in this area that will be on the cusp of actually bringing added value services which are powered by semantics.",

            "Or am I wrong in saying that people used to say the same thing?",
            "Just a question.",
            "Yeah, I mean, there's been a number of rounds of funding now and in this area.",
            "No, I mean, one could even argue KFP 6 already found a lot of projects and and now again, FP7 and I mean it's the same issue with Semantic Web innocence.",
            "No?",
            "I mean is the case.",
            "We throw money at it until it finally sticks.",
            "Or do you have to say some point only certain things just don't workout.",

            "This is what they're doing.",
            "OK, have a TV program?",
            "Actually the website of the TV program at the same time, that's interactive.",
            "This is not really what people wanted, but maybe if the problem is annotated and then you can say OK for a particular object, your concept.",

            "And.",

            "More questions.",
            "Brokers, do you see that that stuff are really scared up tool website is a very good question.",
            "I think this is almost the next step in the research.",
            "Now I'm not aware of much research in the multimedia field which also focuses on web scale.",
            "There's lot of multimedia analysis and annotation work, which is why I put this in for example analysis and annotation research and there's some good results coming out.",
            "But I'm not sure if they try to apply this to.",
            "Every video be uploaded on YouTube.",
            "I don't believe it's going to be able to keep up, and if you think about the scale in which media libraries are growing nowadays?",
            "I mean even just within individual broadcasters.",
            "This is an aspect that needs to be looked into.",
            "I did not know this isn't precisely what you were talking about, but I'm aware that BBC is extensively using not just semantics, but advanced technologies that will overwrite writing plans, massive data stores, and so forth.",
            "So when you go to the website, if you want something you could bring up a picture that's pertinent to it.",
            "Do you know anything about how they were applying semantics?",
            "Oh OK, so only really what comes out of press releases and I don't have any any inside contact to do the BBC, but I know that for example, they have annotated certain amounts of programs.",
            "There was a web interface put on online, we could do semantic searches over program so you start doing which attributes such as no give me all dramas which involved somebody who previously started a soap opera and all these sort of things.",
