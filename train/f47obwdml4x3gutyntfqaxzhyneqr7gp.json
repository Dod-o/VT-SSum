            "Copies, so today of that feature.",
            "So if there are many other features which are highly correlated to that very important feature, then due to this error, two regularization that happens in the Senate SVM this weight of the most important feature will be spread out over all of these sister sort of system variables give it an informal name and this has a very bad effect on your ranking because now the most important feature can decrease in the ranking very much because it has a lot of sister.",
            "Variable sister features in your data set and this totally affects the usefulness of a ranking that you get from an L2 regularised SVM.",
            "So I think you could improve the performance of your linear SVM by looking at L1 regularize SPM or AT and two regularised SPM.",
            "Or by clustering the features a priority such that you then can choose only one representative from each cluster of variables.",
            "And then you get rid of this problem that correlation between features affects the usefulness of your ranking of the features, and I think that is the underlying reason why the linear SVM here performs so poorly.",
            "But this is also the case in the random forest method is also been shown that correlated variables don't always show up in the model, even though it's an ensemble methods.",
            "Actually, there's a paper where they compared feature importance gained from the random forest and symbolic regression paper that actually also shows this problem with random forests.",
            "This is also in sampling.",
            "We used, we don't only sample on the available measurements, but we also sample in the possible transcription factors to try to reduce this effect.",
            "Because if we only have 10 transcription factors, after out of which we can choose, we will probably ignore some of the correlated once and they will show up in different landings.",

            "What is difference between this synthetic data set in the E coli datasets and typically so the algorithms that perform well on the synthetic datasets they perform more poorly on the on the real data set and it's it's a trend that's actually linear methods.",
            "Perform better on the E coli datasets while they perform poorly on the synthetic one, while while the other techniques actually it's the other way around.",

            "Some people say that the gold standard of the real network is just just not good enough at the moment.",
