            "It's science merit and partly on my previous track record.",
            "Indeed for semantic web.",
            "We are as a research lab, have a lot of in-house work going on, giving our limited budget to contract out so.",
            "We have people that are literate in the field of the semantic web technologies doing using ontologies, music, semantic web technologies.",
            "So we do a lot of experimentation with with the things that.",
            "They are offered to us from the private sector.",
            "Well, part of the reason I'm here is to scout out possible reviewers we have, but we have.",
            "So we try to recruit reviewers that are knowledgeable in the area of the proposals.",
            "But because of the way the review process is organized into typically panels that deal with 20 proposals over 2 days, sometimes more.",
            "Sometimes they run three days because of scheduling constraints and conflict of interest stuff.",
            "It is sometimes the case that proposals do not get this as well versed reviewers as we would like.",
            "And we're trying to improve that, but.",
            "We also handle a very fairly large number of reviews every year, and there simply scheduling and conflict because interest constraints so.",
            "But Maria and I, Silvia are have some degree of familiarity with the community and we have access to tools to help find reviewer's.",
            "We try to find reviewers that are are versed in the particular subject area an API's can can suggest reviewers as part of the proposal.",
            "Alright.",
            "So one of one of the things we usually have a minimum of three reviewer's proposal proposal.",
            "Often we will recruit additional reviewers, either because it's an interdisciplinary proposal or if we get back A7 reviews which are.",
            "Not consistent if there's a considerable variance in the reviews.",
            "We will also often send out for additional reviews, so it's not uncommon to have four or five or six reviews.",
            "I've seen as many as eight or nine reviews solicited for proposal.",
            "Sometimes if the proposal falls between two different panels to different parts of IIS or NSF, it will actually get a full review by two different panels, in which case you will succeed.",
            "68 reviews that's consistent with what we do here for all as well.",

            "We just want short-term return investments we're getting in getting our words.",

            "Maybe from one crazy guys, some research lab somewhere in Europe, so this kind of research will still be open, but.",
            "Within the Corporation product, the largest part of the seller and we talked for targeted outcome oriented research and you can do very challenging research, something that you can't even use it.",
            "The risk of getting this into practical application is very, very high, but we are targeted at the outcome to this, so we are not going to do a model for semantic web.",

            "For what that this will not be funded very like so you can put a target out now, but it can be very very risk as quick as we want and maybe the most risk it is, the more chances you might have to get a proposal because nobody valuators wants this kind of challenging with high risk proposals.",
            "You had to put a target out.",
            "You have to get down to the end to the F and to say OK. My idea is successful is not like this, oh.",
            "OK yeah, I just want to say that the National Science Foundation views its basic mission as doing basic science research and so we're not focused on return on investment or deliverables of boxes in two years or things that we fund.",
            "In the computer science side, we see ourselves as the basic funders for computer science across the broad spectrum of research, from basic research to apply, but with emphasis on basic research.",

            "Through the Vulcan does not fund infrastructure research.",
            "Certainly Oval research was an example of that, and to certain extent you can think of my project Halo as as contributing to more basic science beyond knowledge representation, but I think you're correct in thinking that that thread out of my of my remarks.",

            "OK.",
            "I would say, however, that one of the issues that frequently rises with research proposals is that we do look for some discussion as to how we're how the research will be evaluated, and we need some way of discerning whether at the end of three years.",
