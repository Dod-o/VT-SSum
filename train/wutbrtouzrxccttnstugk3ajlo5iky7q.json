            "We have a sales portal which in the end will be store somehow in the tools repository and then it will be consumed in the by the runtime evaluation service.",
            "Which would will be doing in the end is just prepare some kind of built on machine where it will be able to.",

            "We see which is the the your request.",
            "What do you want to execute with which tools, which, there's data etc.",
            "So whenever the platform has the feeling and understanding about which tools you will be needed in the next step will be to prepare the execution environment.",

            "So what does it mean?",
            "Preparing all the data?",
            "Taking the data from this repository services from translator, repository service or the result repository?",

            "The tool prepare anything that has to do that is going to be used.",
            "For instance, imagine that in order to execute your tool, you have to set up any kind of database you have to populate some data, this data or whatever that is needed in order to execute the tool or you have to start up an application server or whatever it is needed for executing the for executing the tool and whenever there truly is prepared, you have set up everything that you need.",

            "We will have to undo all or all our work so we will have to stop first.",
