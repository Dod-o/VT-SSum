            "OK, but this is a pretty non controversial decision.",
            "OK, so LRT so given a likelihood function and by the way a likelihood function is a lot like a probability density function except that you see it as a function of the parameters rather than the data, and we're going to let this big Theta be the full parameter space and fade to 0 be the null or an interesting part of the parameter space.",
            "So in our particular application Theta zero, this is the part where nothing cool is going on or nothing interesting going on.",
            "So Theta Zero is the part of the parameter space in our example where a little Theta.",
            "Inside of little Theta, which is the parameters right all so that contains all of the deltas in our example, so little Theta or the Theta zero contains only little thetas where the deltas are all identical, and So what we want to do is compare two hypothesis.",
