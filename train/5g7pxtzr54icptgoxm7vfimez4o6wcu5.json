            "So what is the thing that you want to be addressed using more than the mode?",
            "I see I know that's a good question.",
            "We are, I think many people who work on these inference problems have sort of an apology in the beginning, saying we'd really like not to do map in France, but even map is hard enough.",
            "We do have some examples, so in the problems I talked about today, like the optical flow segmentation and stereo, it looks like the map estimate is pretty good.",
            "However, there are other lower vision problems, especially things that involve two different factors simultaneously.",
            "Where it's very clear.",
            "So for example, if you're estimating both the lighting and the shape simultaneously, then the map really fails, and that's a great example where we need a lot of help in doing the full Bayesian thing.",
            "But for these problems you know it seems like the posteriors tightly concentrated, so it's OK for us to deal with the mode.",
            "But yeah, I'm with you on your dream as well that if we could do it for version thing even better.",
            "So, so I have a question that might be more appropriate for Vision Conference, but then it sort of comes from something that actually happens in natural language processing, conferences and and if you look at like machine translation systems, it's often the case that as the quality of the translation gets better, it becomes more and more difficult to actually judge the quality of the translation.",
            "Or if you have two translations that are fairly good quality, then it's hard to tell which one is better and less.",
            "You actually have a human who's judging it, and ideally whenever you're evaluating any any machine learning task.",
            "I mean you want to have a large corpus, large test set that you can actually.",
            "Come up with a quantitative measure of how well you're doing, and I think your history of image segmentation was actually really, really nice, but it sort of brought to mind what happens when this quality of the segmentations is getting better and better.",
            "It becomes more and more difficult to judge whether one segmentation is better than another, and so are their strategies for doing that.",
            "Especially when you know when the segmentations are getting really good.",
            "It might be very difficult to judge which one is better than another, so yeah, so when interesting recent trend in computer vision conferences is the availability of ground truth data.",
            "And again, the story is very much like what you're saying is that 10 years ago our results were so bad we didn't need ground truth to figure out that we were doing poorly.",

            "Actually, if you want to continue tutorial for the interesting issues of how to get this data on a large scale basis that people are considering.",
            "Yeah so, but there is some ground truth available.",
            "I I would caution against if you're sort of hungering to use that data for training, there's not really that much data.",

            "Alright, it certainly is possible to do belief propagation hardware.",

            "And you know these 10 minutes can be brought down significantly using special purpose hardware.",

            "That's how you could do belief propagation with neurons.",
            "One thing I would take on this is I think the belief operations too simple, because whatever it is that you envision is doing includes all these global constraints and local constraints, continuous and discrete, so I would not push forward this year I'm looking for that in the brain before we need to figure out a better.",
