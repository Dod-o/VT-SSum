            "How do you mean is if that's useful?",
            "Then other words are not enough that you need a million words to capture all words or whatever is in language, and then you and then you have a high dimensionality and then you reduce dimensionality by using different methods.",

            "OK, so if a word occurs in all the documents I have, it's not really important.",
            "So I will lower it.",
            "Wait this, wait is real number.",
            "And this is this dividing by idea.",
