            "But I want to start by motivating.",
            "How this topic even comes about?",
            "So in 1953.",
            "Something very important happened.",
            "The DNA code was cracked.",
            "The double struck the double Helix structure of the DNA was figured out and this marked the beginning of a real revolution in biology.",
            "Which can be called revolution of molecular biology leading to systems biology and all of the rest of it and.",
            "For those people who were there, this must have been an absolutely electrifying time.",
            "Absolutely amazing to think that this is it.",
            "You've got the blueprint of life now you can go ahead and solve all these big problems.",

            "You've got the blueprint.",
            "Right and the race is on.",
            "Just go and do it right and that's that's the excitement that was on at the time.",
            "And what emerged very quickly is that you can't just look randomly, you have to concentrate your effort.",
            "And there began to be a number of concentrated efforts on a number of model systems from bacterial systems, plant systems, animal systems to through the mouse and up to primates.",
            "Different types of model systems being being chosen for different reasons.",
            "10 years after 1953 and 1963, Sydney Brenner came about and proposed this little worm called C. Elegans center hub Dietis elegance as a model system.",
            "And the idea here is that this is a system that if we're going to crack any animal completely, if we're going to understand any animal completely from the genetics through development to neurobiology and behavior, this is going to be it.",
            "It's simple enough.",
            "And we need the Community effort to go and characterize it and solve the animal.",
            "And what ensued this 40 years of effort?",
            "To do exactly this, Ann by now.",

            "It's the adultism millimeter long and 80 microns thick.",
            "OK, it's transparent.",
            "And what you can do is you can slice it into absolutely miniature slices of hundreds of microns and look at those under an electron micrograph and that's what was done to reconstruct the 3D morphology by looking at these absolutely tiny slices and the slices were kept and revisited more recently to try and make sure to check whether we've missed any connections and so on.",

            "We have 890 electrical synapses that are called gap junctions, so these are basically resistors that connect to pieces of membrane of two adjacent cells.",
            "An we've got 14110 sinapse is that are called neuromuscular junctions.",
            "Those are what connect neurons to muscles, so that's the output of the system onto behavior.",
            "OK. And those numbers might not be very meaningful to you, so you might ask, OK, what can you tell me a bit more so I can.",
            "So it's a very shallow nervous system in the sense that if you look at any sensory neuron and you ask, OK, what's the shortest step to get to a motor neuron?",
            "Or to a muscle, we're talking about 3 four steps.",
            "We're not talking about some very deep network, but we're talking about a wide and shallow network.",
            "We're talking about a system that is very distributed.",
            "But also very modular with a very large concentration of neurons in the nerve ring which is around the neck if you can.",
            "So that the worm has a neck and then a bunch of ganglia, but also a distribution of motor neurons controlling the body wall muscles along the length of the body in something called the ventral nerve cord, which is sort of vaguely equivalent to our spinal cord.",
            "And we know a lot about what the neurons do.",
            "So when I say modular, it's modular in the structural sense.",

            "Not fully understood, but you can simplify it and say that depending on the polarity of the connections, you can have a coherent or incoherent loop, and if everything is basically consists of simple units with basically a activates B activate C in order or a activates B inhibit C, then you can understand these things in terms of logic gates.",

            "Right, so if you've got a cell body and now you're using the same wire to connect to multiple neurons, we shouldn't double count them.",
            "So that factor uses to account for that AIJ is the adjacency matrix and D is the distance either to another neuron or to the sensory organ or to the muscle.",

            "So this is quite an impressive result.",
            "And then you say wait, OK, So what?",
            "And So what is actually the outliers?",
            "So what channel found is that there are a number of outliers that don't obey this.",
            "And it turns out that those outliers have two particular properties that are interesting.",
            "One property is that many of them, it's just a handful of neurons, but but the majority of them run through the entire length of the animal.",
            "And connect to many neurons along the entire length of the animal, but also connect to a number of neurons near the head or near the tail.",
            "And they need to somehow attract all of the connections either near the head or near the tail.",
            "So basically, if you've got this this long Axon, this runs through the whole length of the body.",
            "Then you're introducing a bias between whether these other neurons that took up to it should have along you, right?",
            "'cause you've already got this one with along with along Axon.",
            "That's one property that they have another property that they have is that many of them develop very early in evolution and they may have a job in a role in Axon guidance, so they may be giving cues to other neurons in terms of where those other neurons should develop, and using that they basically formulated the revised cost function just for the outliers.",
            "And got much better agreement.",
            "OK so.",
            "So is this interesting?",
            "I think so.",
