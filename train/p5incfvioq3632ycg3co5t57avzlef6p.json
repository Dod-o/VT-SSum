            "So, so I'm in a very strange position here of speaking for one organization while being part of another one, and I'm going to be the last person to start saying thank yous, so I'm chair of the Association for Computational Creativity, which is this thing here, which is a sort of international organization, or at least it's a non national organization.",

            "Founding such things, especially, you just write down the fact that you've done it and you can.",
            "So there is a steering committee that.",
            "Is gently steering the development of computational through creativity as an international activity, most of which is done via the conference about which you've already heard.",
            "I'm not going to repeat the lovely stories of Liliana that we can look forward to.",
            "I do hope we will see lots of you there.",
            "The more people are there, the more successful the conference will be for the people who are there.",
            "So that will be a very good thing.",
            "I think really all I need to say now is go forth and multiply.",
            "Please tell your friends about what an exciting field this is, you know, and we hope that you will do really exciting things about it and in it, and with it.",
            "That's what we're here for.",
            "And I finally do want to add my thanks to on behalf of the Association for Computational Creativity.",
            "Now to all of the speakers who put all of this effort in but really to handle and his team who have done an unbelievably good job.",
            "You have no idea how much effort it is to organize an event like this, and as somebody I think amilkar already said, Cecil was evident in abundance there.",
            "So thank you all so much.",
            "It's you 2 an whoever else, Alessandro yes indeed, so thank you very much indeed and see you next time, or at least in Louisiana.",
