            "So now we have a huge number of these features, right?",
            "And of course, here you have the problem of explain ability, right?",
            "What are these features?",
            "And so on South.",
            "So far I'm just say OK, I don't care right?",
            "And of course there are ways to explain this as well, but I'm not going to dive into it because remember I only had 15 minutes right?",
            "But once I have these numbers right, I can say whether some purses are more similar to each other or not, right?",
            "So because I have the numbers, I can compare them, right?",
            "And that becomes simple rights.",
            "So I said, OK, this is called.",
            "So let's measure the distances right between the purses.",
            "And then let's represent these distances.",
            "Is something called cracker clustering, which is here right?",
            "So I think this is this was actually the first time the Silvana saw.",
            "Correct your clustering right?",
            "I didn't use this name right.",
            "I just said OK here, it's like.",
            "I don't know, maybe I use this name, correct clustering, but then she said without me telling her anything, right?",
            "She said, oh, that's great, right?",
            "Because somebody or purses are already, you know, in the same group, right?",
            "Or some?",
            "There are some.",
            "There's some mixture here, right?",
            "There's Commission nail and you're right.",
            "And she said, well, can I see this purse is right?",
            "And of course, here's the trick.",
            "Of course, you can see that right?",
            "Because we have image.",
            "We are here.",
            "But if we connect it to the output of the carrier clustering, it's here, right?",
            "So I can do.",
            "So with this combination other already told you about the workflows, right?",
            "So this is a particular kind of workflow that will not only define the process of data mining, but also we are engaging in some visualization.",
            "So I would say that these are.",
            "So whatever I'm doing here is interactive, right?",
            "So basically I can OK.",
            "So basically I can select the parts here, right and.",
            "Of course they form cluster because they all look alike, right?",
            "They're all the same, right?",
            "They're all the same here, right?",
            "To me, they're all the same anyway, but they really look alike, right?",
            "Or maybe hear me right?",
            "Well, they're just different colors, right so?",
            "Maybe that's going to be more interesting.",
            "This is Carmen Chanel, right?",
            "And then another one here, right?",
            "So?",
            "And then, of course, Silvana already had a story right.",
            "Why this is together, right?",
            "Maybe there's one example.",
            "More here, right?",
            "Let's say this was right, he said, well, you know, this is because this door right has the same element.",
            "Has a has a brush, right?",
            "So it was clustered in Chanel cluster, right?",
            "But you can see up there, right?",
            "It has this brush.",
            "And then there's.",
            "I mean, not that I know anything about this, right, but it's like it has a chain, right?",
            "It guess looks alike, right?",
            "So I don't know.",
            "I don't know what she makes out of this right?",
            "I would say, OK, this was probably a trend in a particular year where the designers preferred to have some chain connected to the the purse or whatever, right?",
            "So this is one way.",
            "I mean here it's already interesting, right?",
            "So we have embedding and then the measurements of the distances and then correct your clustering and then actually trying to understand sort of like.",
            "Trying to get the explanation from results right in a sort of.",
            "In some sort of way that I click on the dendrogram and then I check out what the images are fine, right?",
            "Then I also showed her just briefly, right?",
            "There's another.",
            "There's another kind of thing.",
            "I can also do classification, so another mention that the there's this concept of this purse is being classified.",
            "They're already classified because there were three designers, right?",
            "I can test whether Microsoft classifiers work, so one is called logistic regression, which is I'm getting the warning here because of course I cannot classify.",
            "Stuff on the raw images I have to get the embedding South so need to have the embeddings here and then I run it and then I can make a something called confusion matrix and then I see that my classifications are mostly correct so this is what I expect here and for instance here a Dior purses were actually classified as the alright, but two of them were classified as Chanel right?",
            "And when I showed her this she also said OK, let's see how this looks like right?",
            "So I can use an image viewer.",
            "And then analyze these results.",
            "In a way right that would say OK, so these are the fashion areas that were correctly classified.",
            "And the T 2D?",
            "Or is that of course have these chains right?",
            "And the brush that were classified?",
            "Incorrectly, as Chanel's right and so on, I can click on this right and explore right, so bear in mind this this all happened in 15 minutes, so from the idea right?",
            "That somebody is interested in digital humanities and in fashion right to be able in 15 minutes, really to be able to explore.",
            "I mean, these are like essential concepts in machine learning, right?",
            "So OK, the description of the stuff with the features right and then measuring the distances and then doing correct clustering right?",
            "And then even doing classification and analyzing the classification, the prediction right and on top of that right?",
            "Explaining something through interaction, right?",
