            "You can have big ontologies and heavy big ontology means that the inference process requires time.",
            "It's time consuming, so you have to find a kind of tradeoff while that finding ontology concepts and relations.",

            "OK, put this one, this one, this one, this one, and then you have a big ontology.",
            "That is too big because the inference process is time consuming, really time consuming and probably you could have done the same job addressing user requirements, creating a simple ontology.",

            "You you, I think that not really.",

            "I don't have any particular way but it is really important in my opinion to really understand the user needs and requirements.",
            "Because if you want an application that is just needed from the user to search for simple concept having simple relations you just need a simple ontology.",
            "So probably away could be using for instance.",
            "There are system.",
            "Probably you can use.",

            "I think that if you want to annotate the resources, you need to know the resources, so this cannot be an automatic process in general, so the user has to know the resources and tagged the resources providing division, they vision about the resources that are going to be tagged, and these tags are tags that have to be, let's say, based on concept from the ontology.",
            "If I correctly understood your question.",

            "Process automatically, yeah, probably you can do kind of process like that, but I don't have any particular hints about.",

            "So it seems that the core party discovery, yeah?",

            "Or you are going to be 1?",
