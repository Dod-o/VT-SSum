            "Well, this looks like.",
            "An open door and actually it is, but.",
            "When we started this week wise we had some assumptions on quality.",
            "Well, first assumption was that the learning materials that were already available in those collections outside of week wise would be of good quality.",
            "There would be good metadata, the metadata matched the content of the learning objects etc.",
            "That proved wrong.",
            "That wasn't the case.",
            "The second assumption that we made was we as week wise are not.",
            "Determining what good quality is because teachers are quite capable of doing it themselves.",
            "That was wrong assumption, and we also found out that teachers needed a yardstick.",
            "Teachers created learning materials, but were uncertain whether or not it was off.",
            "Sufficient quality to publish it so they needed a yardstick and we.",
            "Instituted by defining kind of minimum quality bubble.",
            "So we defined the several criteria which were, in our opinion the least criteria for which the learning objects shooter is here to have sufficient quality.",
            "And the second thing that we did was that we introduced the notion of quality Marks and quality marks.",
            "When an organization or a group of or whatever had some opinion on learning materials and the quality of learning materials, they could formulate it, they could.",
            "Search for materials in recognize and looked at an if those learning materials adhered to their model of quality and if it was, they could add equality mark to it so it was fixable for every use of recognize that there was a group that said this is of good quality.",
            "Adhering to some quality model and those quality could for instance be.",
            "Good to use when, for instance, you some identical approach.",
            "For instance, Montessori schools which have a certain dialectical approach.",
            "In the learning there is a quality mark for Montessori schools, so they just your learning materials.",
            "Is it good for our way of thinking about education?",
            "And his third assumption, which we had.",
            "But I come back to that in another lesson.",
            "Word is that.",
            "Community based requires teachers would improve learning materials.",
            "They were drunk and republish it to improve the quality and I come back today to cause that didn't happen as much as we wanted it.",
            "The second lesson that creating all we are is a collective activity.",
            "We had the assumption that teachers creating our was a solo activity.",
            "Teacher created ovr and publish it and the individual and the support we offer it from Vicki Wise was geared at the support for an individual.",
            "And then we found out that this wasn't the case that teachers are creating this or we are together with colleagues together with their peers, being it in the same school or outside of the schools.",
            "And So what we found out was that it was a hindrance for teachers to, well, they didn't create as much as we want it to be, because the support that we offered was not cleared of teamwork.",
            "When we change that support.",
            "And we added functionality too so that teachers could create those learning materials as a group.",
            "The, for instance, the Ovr created doubled in the last year.",
            "Because of this support.",
            "This collective activity is also, yeah, of course it is a collective activity becausw when you work in a group you feel you reinforce the feelings of competence through collaboration.",
            "So that was.",
            "The paper is also mentioned.",
            "The self determination theory can explain why it is collective activity.",
            "The third one is that creating Orisa complex task.",
            "There are actually three ways you can create from scratch.",
            "You can create by remixing existing OS or you can create by.",
            "Start with an OR and make minimal adoption adaptations.",
            "Only the 2nd and the 3rd activity were supported by Vicki Wise.",
            "But the two to be user had technical glitches, so teachers felt not supported in creating the order, so they didn't do it.",
            "So we did a usability research and adapted the tools.",
            "According to the results of this usability research and we started to train the trainer program, so we started train teachers in using this tools and they trained their colleagues and so on in the entropy crisis over 1800, teachers trained in that way.",
            "That was the last year of equalized.",
            "We did this program and it gave an increase of 100% of available or we are.",
            "So one lesson learned here.",
            "I can formulate it.",
            "Do not underestimate the perceived and the real complexity of creating hours for teachers.",
            "Yeah, well a 4th one.",
            "As I said it was community based and we didn't want to start our own community, but we wanted to have existing communities of teachers who are already creating and sharing learning materials to join Wiki wise and have recognized as the platform for creating and using and sharing their learning materials.",
            "And that was complex.",
            "The one first watch that.",
            "I have two.",
            "And the first was that.",
            "We were no teachers from the program team, so we were not one of them.",
            "So when we.",
            "Approach him and awesome to join because I say why, why should we do this?",
            "You are not.",
            "You don't understand us.",
            "You are not one.",
            "You are telling us something and you are not teaching yourself.",
            "We solved this by adding an experienced teacher in our team who was the linking pin to the communities and then things started working 'cause she spoke the language of the teachers.",
            "She was accepted as being one of them.",
            "The second one is that we made them stakeholders of their hour plus platform, so they had a good force in a loud voice in determining the development agenda of wiki wise and so they notice that the platform improved over and over again according to their wishes.",
            "So for them this step.",
            "Making two or three guys was much more easier to make, and at the end we really had and connected to week wise instead of their own platform.",
            "And the third one, but that was.",
            "Lucky and that is could explain it, but it is.",
            "Is more coincidence?",
            "Is that the funding of those communities came from one came from Ken said this was one of the founding partners and they had a set of targets for this community in which the funding was dependent on and those targets could more easily be met using required.",
            "So for them this was another motivation to go over to the cross platform.",
            "Well, actually those three lessons are more or less connected to each other.",
            "Then we have that the sharing of ovr should be encouraged and should be made easy.",
            "It is not a natural thing for teachers to share their learning materials.",
            "They should be encouraged by some means that they should be stimulated, but it should also be made easy and one giant hurdle for those teachers were to add metadata to the learning objects to the learning materials.",
            "First, they didn't understand why should I do that?",
            "They did it understand what are those metadata.",
            "And so the this hindered them in sharing those learning materials.",
            "So what we then did as an intervention, we created an upload service over a couple of.",
            "There were a couple of people where the teachers could send the learning materials to and they uploaded metadata for them, and this gave us several thousands of OS which otherwise would not have been shared by the teachers.",
            "Then one interface does not fit all.",
            "We started with the assumption that one interface for all educational sectors could enhance the search for learning materials, for instance by secondary teachers to primary.",
            "Also for higher education sources or primary education, teachers looking for sources in secondary education so that those transfers would be more easy in practice.",
            "This was hardly the case.",
            "People did it and also the demands by the several sectors were very different.",
            "For instance, primary education teachers want to some playful and a nice user interface.",
            "Buffer is higher education.",
            "Teachers wanted some well more distinguished interface and also higher education teachers were hesitated to share the learning materials on the same platform where also primary education teachers.",
            "We're sharing this kind of arrogant maybe, but actually it is what we heard.",
            "So what we did now we had created in the end different interfaces for each of these sectors, but the same underlying platform.",
            "And the second one, the last lesson.",
            "This may be the most important lesson in our opinion.",
            "What the government wanted was amazing.",
            "Oh, we are.",
            "And they created week wise or they said we cry should be created.",

            "They should have become more prescriptive cause the freedom for users to start with.",
            "We are also too big.",
            "There was no sense of urgency filled and in our opinion the government should have done more on this field then just say OK we do recognize and that's it.",
            "So.",
