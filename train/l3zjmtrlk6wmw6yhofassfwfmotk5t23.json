            "Um?",

            "Is it average response, average antibody level over a period of time?",
            "Is it peak anybody level?",
            "So what the idea is that in human beings you would get.",
            "The randomized experiment with dose.",
            "And then you get the outcome variable side effects.",
            "In the macaques get randomized, experiment using the same doses.",
            "And measure image unicity by antibody level or peak antibody level or average on eBay to level and then challenge means poison in macaques.",
            "We relate survival, image unicity.",
            "And dose level.",

            "So why is that related to direct and indirect causal effects?",
            "Well, the intuitive but wrong idea.",
            "Is is one that sort of obvious you say?",
            "Well, let me take a bunch of these macaques and I'll look at the outcome, which is why survival?",
            "And look at to say image unicity.",
            "And look at the level of treatment.",
            "So this is a high low dose, for example, of the vaccine.",
            "This image and icity.",
            "The measured image unicity and this is survival, like the probability of surviving 01 indicator.",

            "Did you have something like this?",
            "And if there's no direct arrow.",
            "Then you say, ah, there's no direct effect of vaccination on survival, except that which goes through image unicity.",
            "So basically this is the same thing as premises definition of a surrogate physical surrogate.",
            "Ross Prentice, the guys at Seattle, WA very very well known biostatistician.",
            "So you regress the outcome variable survival like by a logistic regression on the measured image unicity.",
            "And higher low the the dose level.",
            "And if you when you do that regression, there's no effect.",

            "In fact, it's so seductive that our greatest statistician got it wrong.",
            "Two, that's Fisher.",
            "He got it wrong from the 1st edition of the design of experiments to the last edition.",
            "And he got it wrong in the 1935 edition of statistical methods for research workers through the last edition, he never corrected it.",
            "He didn't understand it.",
            "Now, and that's sort of skip the middle part.",
            "That's more technical.",
            "I will just go to the couple of examples that that document the fact that Fisher got it wrong.",
            "So I think from the little artificial examples is fairly obvious.",
            "What's going on?",
            "This whole problem is complicated because this Y variable, it's not.",
            "It's the observed Y.",
            "It's not what the wise would be if.",
            "If everybody got got both treatments, so they're not the potential outcomes and not the not.",
            "Association, it's not.",
            "It's not causality.",
            "Without some more very strong assumptions that will become clear when they do the artificial example.",
            "Um?",
            "Another example that I've worked on is a.",
            "There is a drug called trapped alone.",
            "Which it was made by Novartis.",
            "It's an anti epileptic drug.",
            "And it's very effective anti drug with few side effects is a fairly new one I think was just approved by FDA maybe 6 seven years ago.",
            "I was consulting for a guy named for Novartis for couple of people.",
            "Also consulting with getting Lou Scheiner was a farmer cologist in San Francisco, and Jerry Needleman, who is a guy at at Novartis.",
            "And the issue here was they done randomized experiments in adults.",
            "And and they was approved.",
            "Perhaps the law was approved for treating adult epileptics, both subjunctive therapy, which means you take it in addition to the old anti epileptic drug you're on an monotherapy based on randomized experiments.",
            "Monotherapy means it's the only anti epileptic drugs you're taking.",
            "But to do a monotherapy randomized experiment, you have to take people who are taking an epileptic anti epileptic drug to limit the number of seizures and they have to agree to be randomized to either this new drug trapped all or placebo and then you count the number of epileptic seizures.",
            "Now, if you're in epileptic, having epileptic seizures is not only not that pleasant, but it's dangerous.",
            "So they also wanted to get trapped in all approved in kids children.",
            "Because it did have fewer side effects, apparently was a better drug.",
            "They had done a randomized experiment as adjuncta therapy with kids who left them on the old epileptic drug you randomly assigned to take.",
            "In addition, either trapped along or placebo and then counted the number of seizures that they had.",
            "But it was considered unethical to do a randomized experiment in kids for monotherapy.",
            "I'll pay you $1000 if you let your kid go on placebo and count the number of epileptic seizures.",
            "Has a 6 year old.",
            "That's not ethical.",
            "FDA didn't think it was ethical.",
            "Novartis didn't think it was ethical, yet both of them wanted the drug approved for monotherapy in kids.",
            "Because they thought it was a safer drug.",
            "Based on the other evidence that they had.",
            "So it's very it's very much like in some sense, the anthrax vaccine example is what you can try to do is bridge from these three places where you have randomized experiments to the place where we don't have randomized experiment.",
            "In fact, in some ways it's easier than the anthrax vaccine, 'cause you're dealing with the same species human beings, on the other hand, just the same way anthrax vaccine is metabolise different differently between men and women in postmenopausal in premenopausal women and.",
            "Kids, prepubescent kids are hormonally very different from post menopausal kids.",
            "Everybody probably realizes, and so it's kind of tricky to do that correctly.",
            "I do that bridging because it it depends upon how you metabolize the drug.",
            "Tramadol is a chemical that's not in your body.",
            "It's exaggerates.",
            "It's only you can only be injected.",
            "So the way it works presumably is because it's in your bloodstream.",
            "And but just because in your bloodstream doesn't mean that you know how it acts, because people have been tablis it very differently.",
            "Depending upon again, outside factors like male female sex race.",
            "Body mass index.",

            "What kind of diet you have.",
            "All your vegetarian and you'll let alot of meat.",
            "All these things affect the rate that the drug is metabolised.",
            "So the whole idea, this kind of bridging is to use intermediate outcome variables and build what's called a PK PD model pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic model.",
            "Finally dynamic response.",
            "How many epileptic seizures do you have?",
            "Family kinetic refers to the concentration of capital in the blood.",
            "But then in order to understand that PK, PD, relationship and not only depends upon which arm of a randomized experiment you were signed in, the dose that that you actually these things were given their titration.",
            "So they changed.",
            "They put the needle in your arm.",
            "They changed the dose level until they reach a certain concentration in the blood and they pull it out.",
            "But then.",
            "Your metabolising this stuff.",
            "So how rapidly with so if you're doing exercise, you metabolising more quickly.",
            "If you're a male human tablet more quickly, So what you do is you look at these PK PD curves within based on a lot of covariates and try to build a model across and if you see no change in these PK PD models across the three randomized experiments we have data, then you feel comfortable bridging this other cell.",
            "We are probably going to see the same PKD response among kids.",
            "But is there a direct or indirect effect of?",
            "Of concentration well what's going on there is I don't even know what it means to have a direct or indirect effect of these traps.",
            "Law an epileptic seizures.",
            "'cause the answer to that question depends upon which covariates your conditioning on you have.",
            "Sex measured you have pre menopausal, measured.",
            "You know how much the person is exercising.",
            "So the question of direct or indirect.",
            "Just as in the anthrax vaccine example, depends upon what else you have measured.",
            "There's not such a.",
            "There's not a simple answer to it.",
            "May make good cocktail conversation, but it makes very, very bad science.",
            "And in fact they still don't know's going back to the anthrax vaccine.",
            "What else does it about the level of vaccination to to sort of do survival?",
            "Because even though the level of vaccination doesn't seem to work, they do something called passive vaccination.",
            "Where you inoculate one monkey.",
            "And then you take his blood out and put into another monkey.",
            "So this other monkey has all the antibodies.",
            "Though their death rates are higher than the one that you get passive vaccination, you die at a higher rate than an active vaccination.",
            "So it's doing something else beyond this antibody level, who knows?",
            "This guy don't know, don't know.",

            "So I want some my tax money back so I can send the kids to private school and this issue was very interesting politically because the people who were in favor of taking the money out the tax money out from public schools were a combination of inner city minorities who are typically very poor.",
