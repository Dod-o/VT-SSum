            "OK, so the problem is if we take all the stuff the system is doing on the data, we reduced it to say one order parameter.",
            "Well we have all kinds information that we have just discarded and that tends to result in a very low power situation.",
            "That is, we have to have lots and lots of data in order to get sort of very, very clean estimate of whatever this distributional form is or whatever it is that we're trying to fit too, because that's the only thing that we're counting on to gather information.",

            "Second problem is that a lot of systems that we're interested in are intrinsically size limited, and so if you only study large systems and say, well, I don't care about anything smaller than you know 20,000 agents then, well congratulations, you just eliminate it a whole lot of the world and introduced a lot of sampling bias because large things aren't necessarily the same small things.",

            "OK, and so there is in this crowd's been pretty good about it, but I have been in a few conferences where people are essentially like, well, you know, there's no point in studying anything that has Western several thousand agents.",

            "The only way you're going to be able to do it is if you're willing to make that assumption.",
            "So I would say if you think that isn't so, the first answer is if you think that you are in an equilibrium context, then I wouldn't recommend using this because the assumptions are not going to be valid.",
            "Now, having said that, we do know we do have some empirical data networks overtime.",
            "For instance, a classic study by Newcomb which does show convergence to an equilibrium state, so we know it does happen in some social systems.",
            "It's not the case that people always wander around forever in or out of equilibrium forces.",
            "In equilibrium, it still wanders in, but in a way that's are guarding.",
            "The second answer though, which I think is even more interesting from a theoretical point of views, because we can characterize what types of utility functions do and do not lead to potential games we can from your argument, potentially identify which types of behavioral rules.",
            "Or can and cannot lead to the type of behavior describing.",
            "So which things ultimately have to lead to equilibrium?",
            "Which things are not going to lead to equilibrium?",
            "And because we know if it's going to generate potential game, it has to lead to equilibrium.",
            "We thus can immediately and Opry Ori classify types of behavior rules.",
            "So I would see that as being a potentially interesting application of that.",
            "Now after a little careful because just because something doesn't generate a potential game does not necessarily Ipso facto mean that it doesn't have an equilibrium distribution.",
            "But again there.",
            "So some subset of them may not, I don't.",
            "I don't know enough about some of the details of what you mentioned, but it does.",
            "I would like to look more into the details of it.",
            "It does sound like it might be quite useful for doing some a priore sorting out of mechanism.",
            "Look at your.",
            "Squad update for thing you pointed out is out how to find a model given an empirical data set.",
            "Offended question is to what extent can this be applied to a dynamic network?",
            "You have created a model to a particular set at a particular time and now let's go another concept folder.",
            "So what extent is all that I know about this particular time extensible or can be used for protection?",
            "Phone number concept.",
            "Is there any relation that you can point out?",
            "Yeah, that's another again, excellent question.",
            "It is sort of short answer is that if in fact the if in fact the same model holds it both times and that's the change reflects simply random drift in the structure.",
            "Then you can at least make marginal predictions about what the future will bring, even though you can't make specific predictions about the detailed dynamics of how it's going to get there from a cross sectional model.",
            "Main Point is, when you deal with cross sectional models, they can only do so much.",
            "If you really believe you're in a significant non stationary dynamic context you need to use a nonstationary dynamic model.",
            "So for instance the stuff the Seattle model and things of that kind of be more appropriate in that sort of setting.",
            "There may be other cases where you have comparative statics where you're in local equilibrium with parameters that are very slowly changing compared to the relaxation time of that process, or the mixing time.",
            "If you prefer of that process in that kind of context, if you could if you could describe how the parameters are changing again, you could make marginal conditional marginal predictions, so there are some dynamic applications, but I think it's absolutely appropriate to recognize that there are substantial limits whenever you're talking with cross sectional things for dynamic, so that's really your interest.",
            "You should be very careful with using this particular formalism.",
            "We do have others for that.",
            "But for this one, I wouldn't do that too much.",
            "Question.",
            "We're doing is basically importing technology or graphical models to their areas of selfie and trying to.",
            "The way.",
            "Mobile complex.",
            "Graphical, I understand what you are saying is that conditional independence rules.",
            "So we try to explain.",
            "According to the rules that you selected for me.",
            "Well, they're not exactly graphical models in the in the usual sense, but they are.",
            "I mean, I wouldn't.",
            "I wouldn't exactly describe him that way.",
            "Their models for grass and a dependence graphs are involved, but usually the kinds of the kinds of conditioned and structures within the graphical modeling literature is generally somewhat different from this.",
            "Well, yeah, there's some differences we can talk about that later.",
            "Now let me get to your second.",
            "Your second question about importing methods mean.",
            "Part of this audit was developed, sort of internally in the field, so I'm not sure if so much.",
            "It's I mean parts were imported, but I'm not sure it was directly imported.",
            "Can you reset the last part of your question though?",
            "Because I've I didn't hear it completely.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, OK. Of different provisional independence.",
            "Yep.",
            "Well, no, it's not.",
            "That's not true because if you, if you posit those different rules than you if you use the combination to generate the model in the 1st place, but in fact, that's the whole point.",
            "I mean, the point is that what you do is you posit, based on whatever you believe is going on the world, you say, OK, these are the things that I think may exist.",
            "These are the dependencies I think exist, and that's based on our priority theory about what kinds of dependencies are likely to exist now, given that leads to a set of models, and those models do work, or they don't work, and you observe which things are things work better in which things don't seem to work at all, and by doing so, you rule out certain classes of processes in certain classes.",
            "Theory, so we're using this as a device to falsify theories by identifying what the implication of that theory is for that distribution, and then seeing whether or not it fits.",
            "I mean, in essence, that's the basic gist."
