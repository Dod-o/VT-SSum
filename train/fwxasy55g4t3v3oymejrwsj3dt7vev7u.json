            "So that means that you can infect me with your tweets about Lady Gaga or whatever and but on the other hand, I can't infect you back.",
            "So to be really general we have to have a directed graph here to cover all our bases.",

            "So we offer at least one piece of this puzzle, which is that information cascades really look a lot different than disease cascades, and in particular repeat exposures look different for information cascades, and this really makes a big difference when you're thinking about what the size of your epidemic should be."

            "It perfectly predicts the where the epidemic threshold is, and as far as the growth, it does a pretty good job.",
            "You see that as we get up to higher transmit abilities, the Cascade growth goes a little bit slower, but this is really just part of the finite graph effect.",
            "You have some unavoidable clustering, so the cascade doesn't get as far as it would in an infinite graph.",

            "If I'm the 100 voter.",
            "So.",

            "That really means that.",

            "And the infection spreads.",
            "You'll never get a case where somebody gets infected by more than one neighbor, so your behavior model sort of doesn't won't tell you anything.",

            "Relevant.",
            "The further away you get from the post time and obviously the more votes happened over more time and so if you have a news article and it's 24 hours old and maybe more interest than 48 or 72.",

            "For instance, if we controlled for how old it is, we see a different drop off in transmissibility, and I think that probably a nice thing to look at actually.",

            "Thank you.",
            "I think it's very interesting that the lack of repeated or the lack of effect of repeated exposures explains so much on DIG versus Twitter, and I'm wondering if it can be further explained by the fact that things cascades on Twitter or on Digg are different from those on Twitter.",
            "So for instance on dig things that spread are mostly news stories that don't.",
            "Really need repeated exposures for you to pass them along, whereas on Twitter you might have something like a social cause spreading or social movement.",
            "Yeah, yeah, definitely.",
            "I think I think you're right that there's a.",
            "The sort of the mechanics of how things spread and what types of things spread definitely has a big effect, and there are differences that we've noticed in Twitter about how things spread and Christina have done more work to about.",
