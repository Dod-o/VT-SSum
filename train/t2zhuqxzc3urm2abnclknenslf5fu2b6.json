            "So, so there's some have been some releases, so for example in the first web click Search Workshop at Wisdom on February 2 months ago, Microsoft releases small query log for for people to do research, but only for those people who participate in the workshop.",
            "And now, as I said before, there's initiative by UMass Amherst, where you can download the toolbar and that toolbar will keep the query log for.",
            "All the people that uses other people could use it for research, so there are some initiatives to have larger query logs to do research.",
            "The problem of their privacy issues that haven't been solved, so the current research on on privacy inquiries.",

            "So in the long tail is is really more than 50% of the queries.",
            "So there is the diversity, the coverage, the rare things.",
            "So I don't think there's some solution for that problem, because from from those queries you can identificate people.",
            "But typically the folksonomies that you demonstrated based on search queries could be things that could be shared anonymously, right?",
            "I mean, all the results, yes, so yeah, the resource could be shared and we're working on that.",
            "So we we we have many datasets that we have shared with with researchers accept query logs.",

            "Basically, using the ranking of search engine to create content, and that's also biasing the content.",
            "So we have many of these things of algorithms affecting what people is doing.",
            "Some of them are.",

            "It's the ability to have a kind of archival version of a service that the logs were put into, or something might be a tougher issue even, but I was just wondering if you have thoughts on that aspect of it?",
            "Well, some of the clocks have been reduced to half clicks, so they have the interaction too, and this you must project also will have that, so they're considering that.",

            "That's why I included in my talk.",
            "So basically there are many other ways to get tax.",
            "So for example, in that case, anchor text will be similar, so anchor text and the link is similar kind of tagging, so one is explicit tagging using links, the other one is explicit tagging and saying flicker, and the last one is implicit tagging in the queries.",
            "So basically a single the same, and you can use the same idea, same kind of relations.",
