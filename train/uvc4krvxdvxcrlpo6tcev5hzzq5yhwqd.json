            "But how can the evolution of language?",
            "How can the the origin of language be relevant to the problem of learning it?",
            "So I'll try and persuade you that it is a bit later on, and the other thing I'm going to be talking about is the problem of the amount of evidence that's present in the linguistic input to the child.",
            "So I'm not going to place any restrictions on the computational complexity of the process.",
            "Is that the child might go through?",

            "How much information in principle could be extracted from the linguistic input?",

            "OK, so the framing question for this first talk is why is it possible that language can be acquired and you might think, well, that's a very strange question to ask, because clearly it is acquired, and so what's the puzzle?",
