            "Also the logistics companies are necessary in that respect, so there was also something we figured out during that process.",

            "So this morning we saw a very impressive presentation from from Mercedes.",

            "So when you order a DVD in the Internet, you would like to know where this DVD is when it is in transit.",

            "Think about in a practical example, if you have a container from Bremen to Cincinnati, you need someone who is able to install the device here in Bremen at the customer's warehouse.",
            "And on the other side of the destination said you need someone who is able to uninstall the device and to put it in a piece of cotton and to send it back to the origin.",

            "And we have a strong network.",
            "I will come to that in a minute.",
            "Also, with a with a backbone and support from the Deutsche Bahn in Berlin from the headquarter, we can offer press announcement and marketing support to customers.",

            "Action plan when someone opens a door in a country where you do not expect it, then they exactly know what to do and maybe they send out the police.",

            "How can you deactivate it?",

            "To make.",
            "Long story short, we equipped 10 ocean freight containers with every technology you can imagine which was available in 2006 and we put them into service between Hamburg and Hong Kong and we just monitor them and checked the quality and so and discussed it with customers and partners to find a solution and to get their opinion to find out the way in which direction we have to go.",
            "In the beginning I can tell you.",
            "We were very sure that people will request our Friday.",
            "But during these tests and also mentioned in the previous presentation, we figured out that you need several RFID readers all over the world at this time.",
            "In 2006 we had a lot of meetings with.",
            "Customs authorities with Corporation partners with carriers with technology companies and they tried to find a solution to use RFID as a standard and they started to discuss it.",
            "Is it RFID in his passive RFID?",
            "The right one is active already, the right technology?",
            "How can we do that?",
            "And then it turned out into a financial discussion and then this baby was that cause people were they had brilliant hundreds of meetings in wonderful locations.",
            "But we know one was pushing their business, and in 2007 we stopped all the RFID activities in the ocean freight because it's an open loop scenario and it was a nice test.",
            "And when customers come to us today we can tell them hey, these are the benefits in a close loop scenario in a warehouse.",
            "RFID is a good solution, but when it comes to ocean freight we have something else.",
            "What we can offer to you.",
            "So we had three different sections, tracking, visibility monitoring and detection today.",
            "We are in that section visibility and monitoring because people would like to see where's my container and what other conditions inside of the container."

            "Yeah, it just put in this slide there.",

            "So everybody was talking about security.",
            "And to be honest we as a logistics company we came into their business in 2000, four 2000.",
            "Five to think about that.",
            "So you see, the first devices in 2001 they were mounted on the top of the container.",

            "Even the next Generation 2000 four 2005.",
            "I can tell you we made a test with this supplier and.",
            "It took 2 1/2 hours to equip one single ocean freight container with said solution.",
            "So unbelievable and we started with was a wireless solution in 2006 and then we put all our requirements into that business and now we are happy to have the small unit.",
            "It's like this size.",
            "It's 1.4 kilos or also in terms of reverse logistics.",
            "Very easy to fly it back in forest.",
            "Cost efficient and.",
            "No cables from the manufacturing part of you.",

            "10 seconds to install it to the container?",

            "So when the container doors opened in Russia.",
            "You can see.",

            "And in addition to that, what is the action so?",
            "Therefore, it's very important to to have also a Corporation partner which is aware of the logistics process is not only in terms of the technology requests and the device itself improves or enhances the visibility.",

        [
