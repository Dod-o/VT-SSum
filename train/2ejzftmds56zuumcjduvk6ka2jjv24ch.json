            "The easy ones were simply atomic subclass inclusions, nothing more complicated.",
            "The medium ones required some role restriction, so some property restrictions, existential or Universal's usually, and the hard sentences require the technique called roll ification, which is a standard technique for converting rules into description logics or owl.",

            "Essentially means that if they are faced with this type of task to modeling, all they usually give up because you know, if you don't know the technique, you don't know how to do it.",

            "Owl then you notice.",
            "Well there is a conclusion here which is actually a binary predicate, so it's a property or a roll.",
            "Now, what type of axioms can you make in our which have that on the right hand side of an inclusion?",
            "In that case, a role inclusion?",
            "Well, it's only role chains.",
            "That's the only construct you have to do this.",
            "But if you now look at the left, there's not only roles there, there's also a class there.",
            "Which means you cannot just use a roll chain.",
            "So before you can convert that into our, you have to typecast this class into a binary predicate into a property, and you can do that using the self predicate which is available in our two.",
            "So you use this axiom and the R1 is essentially a typecasting of person into a role, and then you can make A roll chain.",
            "And yes, that works OK, and if that was too quick for you, don't worry about it, right?",

            "Actually, if you know how to do that in Prodigy subclass relationship, you can do it via drag and drop, which of course uses uses fewer.",
