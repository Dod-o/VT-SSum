            "So when when you think when the brain is active, many parts of the brain are interacting with each other and so for example you have some frontal areas with some motor areas interacting and that's what we want to estimate from microscopic macroscopic measurements external to the head.",
            "For example, this cases could be image sensors for example.",
            "We can we measure signals here coming from the brain and from these signals we want to see whether things are interacting or not and what precisely happened happening there.",

            "So when we want to say, say, then we find for example, we have two channels here, X2 and X3.",

            "This is not possible on physical grounds, at least not in general.",
            "And so the problem here is then how can we distinguish artifactual correlations with or which look like synchronized sources, but which are just an artifact of volume conduction as opposed to true interactions?"
