            "My former job.",
            "I started design and I was working in a big design of us in Belgium and at the time beginning of the 90s in Belgium I don't know how it happened in Slovenia, but older big banks that were merging together in Eubanks.",
            "So we had eight banks in the beginning and the resolved in four bigger banks.",
            "As you know this already.",
            "The effect is that the logo changes and everything which image of the bank stands for has to be changed.",
            "So at that time our company our designs to do was very specialized in interior design.",
            "We did shops offices but also branding design, so we did every product that would Bury the logo of the design of the company and how to communicate with the consumer with a with a client.",
            "So in that case we were very good or the very good partner for being.",
            "Bringing new logos on the signs of the walls of banking offices.",
            "To start off, such a big project, we first did research with the producers and the assemblers of these sign lighting signs and.",
            "We found out they also were the people who are going to put the signs on the walls of the bank offices, and it was also very interesting to see they would also replace and take off the old lightings and we were very interested to what happened with those signs and entities and it seemed they all went in a big container and just what were put away and left his waist so there was not much recycling going on back then.",
            "Second thing we noticed is that.",
            "Maybe as in Slovenia in Belgium, older buildings have different facades, different walls, so in an ideal situation you would have to make lighting sign like these.",
            "You would have to make it custom made for every building.",
            "But you have to understand for each bank this was a huge operation because the banks at like 4000 to 6000 offices in Belgium.",
            "So together with like 12,000 offices we had to make new signs for.",
            "So we do this as a realistic approach.",
            "We made several designing elements, so we made for each bank different elements and they could be combined together to make the image.",
            "The bank would like to have on the on the wall of the of their bank office and the installers got a manual so if they came with a bank or a new facade they could see which elements they could use and to have the total look and feel of the bank as a result.",
            "So we did that for every type of bank, so that we did three big merge banks altogether.",
