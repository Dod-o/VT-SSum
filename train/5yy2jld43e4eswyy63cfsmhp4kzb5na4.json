            "100 degrees centigrade.",
            "But the other way around it to to get to evaporation is of course, if you lower the pressure right and you have to lower it to very very low flash pressure, it's 20 degrees.",
            "This pressure would be about.",
            "0.03 buyers so 3000 plus guys.",
