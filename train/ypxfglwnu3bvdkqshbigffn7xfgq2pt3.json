            "So I'd like to go into a little bit of the Kleinberg lore before I talk about his awards.",

            "Is because, as you can see, Rebel King is an anagram for Kleinberg.",

            "But I think it's not really until we awarded him a best paper award that John's career started to take off.",
            "So in 2003 I think we get a lot of credit for bringing Johnson some publicity and fame, and since then he's only done good things he's got in MacArthur Fellowship Foundation Grant in 2005.",
            "That's referred to as the Genius Award, and it certainly applies in this case.",

            "This is one of those awards that's only given out every four years, so this is a very, very significant award.",
            "This one is given for the person who makes the most contribution to theoretical computer science so.",
            "In 2007, John was elected to the American Association of Science, and I think John has only good things coming.",
            "Now that we've decided to make him an invited speaker at KDD in 2007.",
            "So I'd like to finish by talking about one award, which I think for John is the most important, most significant award.",
            "It's his first award, at least the first one we know about this award happened when John was in grade school.",
            "They were having a contest to see who could read the most books.",
            "In a month and they wisely separated the contest into the girls, a contest among themselves and then the boys, a contest among themselves and the winning girl.",
            "One by reading 23 books and it was a very tight competition.",
            "The runner Up Girl had one had Red 22 books so you can see that was a title.",
            "Take competition on the winning boy of course, was Jon Kleinberg.",
            "John won by a landslide and John Dunn did this by Reading.",
            "One book.",
            "Now this is funny, but I actually think that as this early award it had a lasting impression on John and has shaped all of his work ever since.",
            "If you know John's models, the parsimony of his models is remarkable.",
            "So John manage is to put just the minimum amount you need in the model to fully represent the phenomenon, and I think that's really where his success comes from.",
            "And I think he learned parsimony during this early competition.",
