            "Some of the several were women, so it was less isolated for those women.",

            "So it was a way to change the culture of the Department.",
            "The other thing that is.",

            "Might give a pretty broad lecture, might meet with a group of graduate students in a very narrow research area, so makes multiple appearances, and this undermines the belief of people as old as I am, that there aren't any women out there because you're bringing women in.",
            "And next time that you have a search, you might even ask that woman to apply or that she is a person you can contact and say do you know anybody?",
            "Who might apply for the so it's a way to break it, to broaden the old boy network.",
            "So that's another.",
            "And it's a pretty cheap way to do that.",
            "If you say to a Department, here are these funds and you can only get it if you bring in women all of a sudden they know how to find women, so it's very satisfying.",
            "And the other thing that's about changing the culture is to train leaders.",
            "So you training Department leaders, faculty leaders at your training, personnel, committees about common practices that work against women.",
            "And you train them about laws that make it illegal for them to ask some questions that otherwise they might ask.",

            "Then all those things are not as good in the states as it sounded like earlier today.",
            "Um?",
            "Well, the other thing about training the leaders and personnel committees is that when you have somebody who successfully runs a search and finds great women to bring in when you have somebody who at particularly men when you have somebody who comes into his Department, is chairing the Department and everybody knows that it has become a warmer climate for women and for men.",
            "Perhaps what you do is you have a panel.",

            "It depends on the sub disciplines.",
            "OK, the last thing is that you have to do things about the work family balance, which means things that we've been hearing about, but one of the ways that this happens is it could be a cost share.",
            "So for example, if your institution really wants to hire woman physicist for the first time in however many decades, and she has a husband who is a sociologist, and we already have more than enough sociologists if you really want to get that woman to come to the physics Department.",
            "At some institutions, the central administration will give the sociology Department some money towards that position.",
            "The physics Department will give some money towards that position, and the sociology Department at most places would also be expected to give some money because they should have some stake in their choice.",
            "This is these are difficult hires to make because the sociology Department very likely to say how come they wouldn't let us hire for years.",
            "And now they're shoving this guy down our throats, so this is not easy, but it is something that people have some success with and family friendly policies include things like stopping the tenure Clock, which means that instead of coming up for tenure in her 7th year, a woman who has had a baby in the 5th year.",
            "Can say I would like to have one year more because in this first year I'll come in and I'll do some stuff, but I really can't work very much on my research anyway, so we're almost done right?",
