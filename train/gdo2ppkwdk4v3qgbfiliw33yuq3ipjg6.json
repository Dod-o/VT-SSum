            "So I wonder where this comes in in your model, because you you notice there is a saturation after awhile when you manage when you had a slide then after a certain K it's over saturates right?",
            "So I wonder if this is the effect of that that cascades or a very large scale actually propagate by momentum.",
            "As an avalanche rather this as a genuine interest in public, I think this is an excellent point so that that basically are something is growing right early on.",

            "Go take a look.",
            "So here I think the largest cascade that we have seen was around 100,000.",

            "So I think this kind of Gangnam Style cases are extremely, extremely, extremely, extremely extremely rare.",
            "So seeing that to have enough of those kind of cascades to be able to say anything significant, I think we would require several years of data.",

            "So I think is our understanding of content right?",
            "Can we describe truly engaging viral content well?",
            "And of course, content by itself makes makes a lot of plays a major role, but it seems content is kind of a necessary condition, but not a sufficient one.",
            "So in a sense, you can take good content and make a mess out of it, and you need all these other this all these other factors to get right for something to really get popular.",
            "So I think content plays more roll than at least what we found in this study.",

            "For example, from this experiment where we keep the content constant, the inequality of success was huge, was kind of more skewed than human wealth, right?",
            "It's who started it, and so of course, it's connected to everything.",
            "It also depends, yes, who is who is the person that is starting something exactly exactly.",
