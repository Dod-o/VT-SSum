            "This manifests in two ways in two kinds of complacency is the first complacency kind of termed for now a kind of value, complacency or not necessarily happy with that name at the moment, which assumes that Liberty is containable is containable for security and then it should be secondary to security, which amounts essentially to the claim that Liberty is nice and we like it.",

            "Now I realize I'm in a room full of experts have been talking about those things, but I think that nevertheless the general populace don't really think all that much about how much of their information and data is being taken, so I take that as a kind of significant.",
            "Point and I think this also happens for a number of reasons.",
