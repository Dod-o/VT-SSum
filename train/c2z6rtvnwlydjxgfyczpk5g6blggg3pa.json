            "So they'd say, oh, that's the old incompatible superclasses thing again.",

            "No matter how many other hurdles there are, even ones that are fairly close to it.",
            "And I find that counter intuitive, but I agree that perhaps what we should have done is to make a set of possible hypothesis about how the not just one make a set of them and then and then see which one is best supported by the data, right, perhaps?",

            "So that raises the question of whether whether the ranking tends to be the same for any individual.",
            "Right, so I guess that's a matter true, and maybe there's some people.",
            "Get tripped up by something which somebody else thinks is quite easy.",

            "Anyone more?",
            "So I'm sorry I may be OK. Just a quick question on the tool.",

            "However, I think what we should do is to try and get a sort of version of the tool that we can make available.",
            "I mean we our policy is that we're very happy to make it available so it's just a Java program which we can make available as open source.",
