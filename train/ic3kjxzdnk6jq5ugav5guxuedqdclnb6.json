            "So if you have this sort of do something simple to start with, a good thing to do would be or just to look at the number of friends in common, right sort of makes sense, and it's sort of natural intuition that if you have many friends in common with the person, you probably know them somehow, right?",
            "And of course, this is true, right?",
