            "So let's see what do we mean by predictive modeling first of all.",
            "So I want to say that we should be thinking general.",
            "We should be thinking about the general definition.",
            "I'm going to say, well supervised learning is next, and we see that this is what we are often used to.",
            "Thinking about.",
            "Modeling, but we want to be more general and we see that in particular for competitions, it doesn't always fall into the specific supervised learning mode.",
            "So let's think about predictive modeling as a situation where we're giving a bunch of observed data, whatever it may be, and we're supposed to use that observed data to build some kind of model.",
