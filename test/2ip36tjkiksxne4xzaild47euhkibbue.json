            "It doesn't have to think about a little bit, but it's an interesting idea.",
            "So as you know, I'm a user of your neural networks, yeah, and so I I see it on the ground and I have an image in front of me where it's chosen, some inappropriate adjective.",
            "Yeah, this one is one way of fixing that.",
            "I think part of the problem is that you don't allow people tonight to negatively tag things with adjective.",
            "We do.",
            "We do actually, but do people do that?",
            "Sometimes yeah yeah they do.",
            "And we actually build our own negatives too.",
            "But you're right, we could probably do better about that, but people can tag negatively, but you can't.",
            "I mean, you wouldn't want to tag everything with everything.",
            "I don't know what the way we have only aware that this is definitely not fiery.",
            "Then maybe the way we have them do it is to tell them Darcy thinks this is Fiery.",
            "If you disagree, take it off.",
            "That's how we get negatives.",
            "We don't have people go in and say this is not.",
            "This is not this, but I think that would help me quite a lot.",
            "But yeah, but definitely not an orange image.",
            "And then it says, yeah well, this stuff right here uses some different features than what you have improved things somewhat.",
            "It's a really hard problem, and as long as you have people labeling things, you're going to have issues now.",
            "Orange, of course we should get right all the time, but having them labeled explicit, negative negative is really tough too, because we're talking about now hundreds of things, and we can't just say go through all 300 adjectives and say no to all of them.",
            "Nobody would do it.",
            "No, it's only one is violently is definitely not that.",
            "Let's let's talk about something.",
            "I think it's it's totally fascinating to see what you can do and what's possible.",
            "You know I'm approaching this from a different perspective, and you know, when artists create images.",
            "Oftentimes, we create images that you can't describe with words.",
            "So yeah, like something like Fiery, it's you know we have a tools within our own repertoire.",
            "Like if you've come across like Maluma Tech, attack it a which is kind of like an intermediary language which is kind of gibberish, but it has this feel to it like sharp versus smooth.",
            "That might be a nice way of giving some like some distance from the adjectives to actually resulting images.",
            "I'd love to talk more about that.",
            "And the other thing that I was thinking about is with some of your images that you're creating, like the ones that are deemed failures.",
            "I have to say that like some of the failed images, I was actually.",
            "Within the context and next to that word, it's actually really, you know, it makes me think a lot, so it's a failure in it, so it's a success in a very different accent.",
            "Yeah, I agree with that too that we were being kind of strict in our idea of failure simply meant it didn't look like the image, and it didn't look like the adjective, but from an artistic standpoint that might be exactly more interesting.",
            "Is showing up in the Tate Modern isn't such a bad thing.",
            "So I agree.",
            "I just like to I just like to be snarky.",
            "I totally agree.",
            "I found that really interesting in number of different ways.",
            "And it was reminding me of studies of cross domain creativity and I was thinking you could choose adjectives such that you could really be exploring the extent to which you know people do apply adjectives that are clearly from another domain to that domain.",
            "But to you know the visual art domain.",
            "But my question was what's your sense of why the minimum rule was the most successful?",
            "Yeah, that's the picture I skipped.",
            "This is why I think this picture right here shows over time.",
            "How many filters get put into the genome?",
            "Now, this isn't a completely, uh, completely perfect correlation, but usually the more filters you apply to an image, the more you mess the image up.",
            "If you don't apply any, you don't do much to the image and you see the minimum is right smack in the middle.",
            "It's applying enough features, enough filters to do interesting things, but not so many to completely obfuscate, which is where the adjective thing gets way out there and justice completely messes the image up, 'cause it doesn't care what happens to the image as long as it looks fiery, for example, and some of the others don't do enough.",
            "To really change in particular the similarity, one just kind of stays not doing anything to the image, 'cause that gives it the highest fitness.",
            "So that's our first guess at why the minimum is good is because it finds a balance between messing the image up some but not too much.",
            "OK, OK let's thank you."
