            "They said, oh, the best treatment needs to impair that memory.",
            "So we will extinguish that memory.",
            "How do you do this?",
            "You take the drug addict, you put them in the hospital and you give them a needle.",
            "But in the new action in the Sea Ranch, there's sailing this vehicle.",

            "That's a good extension.",
            "You put them back in the street and they start again the next day.",
            "Because the memory is about this stimuli in the big picture in the environment.",
            "And when you discuss with Alex at one point, the drug has somehow contaminated who they are, their episodic memory.",
            "The drug is is become part of weather experience for many years.",
            "So if you were to take away the regulated memory, you would have to take away who they are.",
            "So the only way you can help them is to increase plasticity.",
            "Stop the aberrant memories right now from triggering aberrant behaviors and help them in a drug Free State to re learn about their life.",
            "Without the track.",
            "OK, I think that we have.",
            "I have asked you all the questions that I had an I believe that the audience has some interesting questions so maybe we can now rotate our microphones so at some point you said that the drugs destroy your capability of inhibition so like they inhibit your inhibition system.",

            "Like?",
            "I mean if you start with coffee you'll end up on heroin at some point.",

            "So far.",
            "It's like Superman no one's shown it doesn't exist.",
            "So you can believe in it if you want I. I'm not saying it the wrong way, it's it's an interesting hypothesis that may in some individuals be important because it may increase your self confidence of control.",
