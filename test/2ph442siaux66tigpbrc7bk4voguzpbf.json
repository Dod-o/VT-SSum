            "They can show very well relations among people in the industry, in the in, the organization, radial layouts are very good at showing enter interactions.",
            "They're very good showing how people have interacted with in this organization.",
            "So the next step was that we wanted to combine both of these approaches to come up with a different kind of visualization.",

        [
            "So we've modified the simnet.",

            "The two loads up with clusters of everyone in the group and these clusters are based on.",
            "The expertise that we found.",
            "And as you see that when it loads up it, it spreads out everywhere and it uses force directed approach to spread out these clusters.",

            "So that it's easier for them to play around with it, I'll just go back.",
            "Now the interesting thing that we've noticed over here is that all of these people were members of one group, but we see a lot of people from technology in general, so this is a cluster that we used where we couldn't define which group they would be falling into.",
            "So this is a cluster where we've seen that these people interact more with other people and also work on things like social web.",
            "This is a cluster where we've seen people are working on information retrieval.",
            "And this is these are people who've been talking about a lot of politics.",
            "These are people who've been working on a lot of knowledge representation, so building ontologies.",
            "Now when we combine everything together in this exploration tool, we've realized that people do not talk much amongst themselves and people talk to other people, other people from other research areas.",
            "Reaching that, this is because a lot of people collaborate with other people from other research groups or other research areas within one group.",
            "And they send emails among themselves, but they do not around people who've been who've been associated with the same expertise.",
            "And there's another reason why this is possible is because people are people work to tend to work out there to talk to people who are working on the same projects.",
            "So HCR people do not talk too much with amongst themselves, though they have some level of interaction but they talked to a lot of people from technology from social or from information retrieval and that is possibly because they haven't been grouped according to projects.",
            "If we had grouped them according to projects.",
            "You would probably see a lot of Inter cluster intra cluster communication.",
            "So here is an example where the user lays out the network as they want and then the user is searching for a topic which is Twitter and once it does that you can see that the system has highlighted 5 individuals among the network who have talked more about Twitter and over here the user is adding another topic which is human computer interaction.",
            "So this user is looking at people who've been talking a lot about Twitter as well as human computer interaction.",
            "And this system helps pick up the people who've been talking more about it and suggest experts.",
            "Now when you click on one user you get a highlighted list of all the emails that that's been sent around the whole network.",
            "So when you click on that, you get an updated tag cloud.",
            "So this tag cloud combines all of the emails that have been highlighted and gives an overview of what are the emails that have been sent around.",
            "Now we also have access to all these emails that have been shown here.",
            "So once a user.",
            "Clicks on a particular selects a particular topic.",
            "So for example, the user is selecting chocolate and the user sees that there are four people around the network who talked about chocolates.",

            "For example, the freeze nodes.",
            "We've realized that force directed layouts are sometimes not very suited for a lot of people, and in that case they can freeze the nodes and they can move it around as they wish.",
            "So we've basically looked at how we can profile users.",
            "We looked at.",

            "First is about the definition or difference between the concepts, keywords and the named entities what, what exactly is the concept you mentioned in this in your context.",
            "So from what I understand concepts are looking at semantic contexts.",
            "The keywords are just plain keywords that are extracted from the text.",
            "Keywords include phrases or just keyword.",
            "Know they're just keywords OK and then then the end.",
            "It is our services and then people's name organizations, peoples name and well.",
            "These are basically identified from the open Calais web service and these are basically all the results that we get from the open claim.",
            "But what other concepts here?",
            "Just semantic concept.",
            "What exactly isn't in the email with what exactly concept in the email?",
            "So so?",
            "These are semantic concepts that we could identify using this wiki fi web service and I I'm not quite familiar with the Wiki Wiki Fi Web service, which if I from what I understand Wiki Fi is a service that enables you to send some text and it replies with a set of concepts that are semantic.",
            "Concept from some ontology.",
            "I believe sonomia yes, I believe so.",
            "I'm not very sure of how the web service works, but I wouldn't want to.",
            "Yes yes yes.",
            "I believe so.",
            "Yes, oh so is this concept related to Wikipedia?",
            "Yes, OK, I'm not sure if it has any link to DB pedia though, but it could.",
            "It could be DB pedia concept.",
            "But I'm not sure of that.",
            "I see that does for interesting and then regarding to your map in the simnet.",
            "If you can go back to that visualization there.",
            "Yeah, you know that previous one.",
            "Just yes this one.",
            "OK said there's a link from certain user to another user.",
            "Is it just?",
            "I mean that the message first time I don't see a direction and 2nd is it the two CC included or just two in this case?",
            "So this is 2 NCC include two SEC OK?",
            "Alright, this my last question is, I mean that I think is really interesting research and you measure the similarity between the users right after you build this profile models.",
            "What do you plan to use it?",
            "You know, do you?",
            "Do you plan to use it to infer possible actions upon emails?",
            "If I receive email from user A, what should normally what I need to do is I need to decide what to do with that reply immediately or put it aside for awhile.",
            "The lady or something like that, right?",
            "Have you thought of doing something like that?",
            "Basically help users determine the importance or priorities of email.",
            "Something like that.",
            "I'm not sure if I get the question correct, but I think this might help that we've realized that in an organization, experts that are hard to find.",
            "So the way we are going to use this profiling within an organization is to pick up experts from a list of people.",
            "Is it OK to come back?",
            "But how do you define experts using the similarity between the users in this case?",
            "So OK, so we don't only use the similarity, but we use the profile.",
            "So in the profile we get a list of concepts and we use those concepts to identify peak people who are experts or who know more about that cause this concepts about these concepts on the basis of the interactions they are having with a lot of people we've looked at only email, but we could possibly look at other kinds of interaction.",
            "And we could possibly wait interactions based on that.",
            "I mean, I guess I'm still not quite clear how you decide who is expert dependently concept, but I'm I think this is really interesting work.",

            "Thank you very much.",

            "Example in Germany it's not even possible to look at emails after they have passed the certified spam filter is not allowed to even for companies.",

            "And even if your technique is being applied, even the public, which I doubt it will ever be because of these privacy concerns.",

            "For example, you know documents about contracts or documents about your financial issues etc.",
            "So how do you deal with that?",
