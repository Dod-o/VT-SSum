            "This is what Gaffey uses.",
            "This is also probably what you use at least now you know how it's done.",
            "So what happens here is you also agglomerate.",
            "You also combine nodes, but every time you combine nodes, you check the modularity of the entire system.",
            "If the modularity increases, then you keep that one and then you keep on grouping them together, clumping them together, making sure that you are maximizing the modularity.",
            "OK, is that clear.",
            "Yes.",
            "So these are just the slides that we had earlier, OK?",
            "She is really just this line here.",
            "I mean, I could have just given a 5 minute presentation, but yeah, OK.",
            "Sorry, Oh yeah.",
            "Yeah, that's a very good question.",
            "All of the models have their own kind of advantages and disadvantages.",
            "I think you would need to really have to look at the references for this one because you could look at like computational complexity or probably depending on how connected that your networks are, but normally based on what I've seen so far, they would usually use the Community, the modularity maximization one, but I'm pretty sure there are.",
            "Newer models out there, yeah?",
            "Alright, so if you do the partition using modularity maximization by Louvin, then you're going to have this.",
            "So how how does this network compare to the original 1?",
            "Can you can you look?",
            "I think 9 is a bit misplaced.",
            "Right?",
            "Yeah, nine should be blue, but it's red here so it's not perfect.",
            "This is how models work, but at least it gives you a good idea.",
            "An approximation of what the system really is, so you can try the device in by Griffin and human.",
            "Or you can try to agglomerative by revash, the one that we discussed just now.",
            "Or you can try this one.",
            "Alright, and then some real world networks.",
            "We're almost done, I'm just.",
            "I think this might take awhile if I load this up can you try it on your computers?",
            "I'll try it as well.",
            "Yeah it is a big network.",
            "That's why we're also you will notice in the notebook.",
            "I commented out the plotting.",
            "What I did instead was exported to Gaffey, so we can just plot it using F. You were not going to calculate this, so we're just going to jump here and this is how it looks like.",
            "Anyway, Gaffey uses the same community detection algorithm here, so this is what you will see there.",
            "It's really interesting when you dive in, especially if you know the different heroes.",
            "In Marvel I is Wolverine, Marvel gyno.",
            "Yeah, OK, so yeah, I'm very confused with Superman and all this.",
            "Alright.",
            "And yeah, you can.",
            "You can have a look at the different elements inside a community by just running this code here and then you can print like the first 10 communities you can see.",
            "Oh sorry, I didn't write it earlier.",
            "Anyway, let's just skip it and then the Co occurrence network.",
            "The framing analysis that I showed earlier.",
            "I also provided the data for that.",
            "You can run it yourself.",
            "You can find partitions you can look for words that coexist.",
            "In one community, so you can have that as well.",
            "And finally the political blog.",
            "You also have the data you should have downloaded that.",
            "And yeah, we can plot it.",
            "Oops, takes awhile.",
            "Sorry.",
            "And we can find the community in the political block, the one that I showed you earlier and we can color the different nodes based on their classification.",
            "So red or blue.",
            "OK, so yeah, here in this one we still have the isolated nodes.",
            "What we're doing in the next few cells is just focusing on the giant component, which is the one at the center and then zooming in on this one such that we will have this big node here.",
            "OK. Yeah, that's it for the Community detection.",
            "Talk if you have questions, just feel free to ask.",
            "It's very descriptive in nature.",
            "And yeah, you can start with your projects if you have no more questions.",
            "Sorry.",
            "How does the?",
            "This.",
            "I think it's the need for scientists to quantify things.",
            "So even if you have, for example a divisive method, you really have no way to tell if it's important or not.",
            "Yeah, one thing about modularity is is it only makes sense if you have another network to compare it against.",
            "OK, another kind of partitioning to compare it again, so you know that it's better or not.",
            "Yeah, I'm not really sure how they came up with it.",
            "Might be there walking in the park or something, but.",
            "Yeah, at least we have a measure of the partitions.",
            "The modularity with higher modularity that.",
            "Now I mean I comparing the different partitioning for the same network.",
            "Yeah, for example, just going back to this structure here.",
            "This is these.",
            "Are these two are the same networks, right?",
            "But this one you have a different partitioning compared to this one, so you can get the modularity of this one and compare it with the modularity of this one.",
            "But in terms of models comparing models, I think that this is a bit more comprehensive and we would be need to look at the references for this one.",
            "German.",
            "Is this difference?",
            "Or some combination.",

            "Explanation Chapter 9.",
            "Yeah, the book is like at the bottom I provided it under the bottom of this table.",
            "Yeah, that works science one.",
            "Yeah, so you're just subtracting.",
            "So what really happens?",
            "This value here is just the connectivity.",
            "If you just put their edges in random across the network versus the actual one that you have.",
            "So just subtracting it.",
