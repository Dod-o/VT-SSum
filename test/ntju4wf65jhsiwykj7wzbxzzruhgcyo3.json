            "Would you comment all at all on whether or not perhaps this problem could be addressed by doing better education to the intelligent development community?",
            "It is an issue, that's why when I mentioned that.",
            "So This is why we need to keep the access and an to the intelligence transparent.",
            "So this decomposition stuff should be transparent, logical.",
            "You should still be able to work with the ontology is if it is as if it was just a single set of actions in traditional representation, and I think just by building smarter interfaces you can do that because there's nothing.",
            "There's not a lot of structuring there actually.",
            "There's no overlap between atoms, so it's you can work with something like a virtual ontology, which is just the union over all those atoms and.",
            "You're going to get the exact same entailments and you know with some with some help from you.",
            "I think it's perfectly possible.",
            "Well, at least we hope it is possible, although not done it yet.",
            "I think it's a very nice idea to cash the modules in speed up the computation.",
            "What I think it might be a problem that if for example, in this by Portal One Ontology is changed a little bit, then you probably will need to recompute this for all ontologies.",
            "That is some power.",
            "Using this ontology in somewhere in the lyrics.",
            "Yes, this is another issue that so and there's incremental updates to there are like 2.",
            "Level, so first you need to update the composition of of this particular ontology.",
            "And of course you will need to update the decomposition of all ontology which imported and well we will investigate the first level to make sure that if you change something new tee box it's going to be like a.",
            "In any case, is going to be just a local updates to the decomposition, but of course if you have something like the phone in Barber by Portal which is used in many places, then there should be not only technical, but like other aspects, more responsibility.",
            "When you make a change, you release it less often.",
            "You know, make sure we don't cause problems to people who use it because the competition is just one example how it may cause problems, but you know if you changed him semantics so very basic terms of a highly used ontology.",
            "But there's something that that that's the thing you need to be careful about anyway.",
            "OK, another question, I'm very nice work.",
            "I just have one quick question.",
            "Why did you choose to work with Gene Ontology NKV?",
            "Well, I'm not going to say that was completely random choice, but.",
            "Well, first of all, they peer many publications of people seem to work with those quite well, so at least.",
            "I knew I wouldn't have to explain in detail what what, why those ontologies are important and they have a large enough to be interesting, and they're pretty representative in terms of the structure, and you know, we could have taken something else, conceptually speaking, KIVI and go are related from the modules.",
            "Did you find that that kind of relationships to be more explicit?",
            "I'm not sure I got the question.",
            "Can you just the the ontology for chemical entities of interest cavey and the gene ontology.",
            "Some terms in gene ontology are conceptually related to some terms in KV as you are modularizing the ontologies.",
            "Do you find those relationships to be explicit?",
            "Because right now as they are, they are just independent, so I would expect that if you if you modularize those ontologies, you could at least see the relationship between Kellyanne Gene Ontology.",
            "No, we didn't.",
            "We didn't do any in any of this, so we didn't really look at terms or many of those terms that just.",
            "For us it was just a black box kind of source of data and then nothing but, but the way we did this comparison for all ontologies we download as a result.",
            "So in the paper you can see that for vast majority of ontologists it does work much faster, although there are some pathological cases as well.",
            "OK, any other quick question.",
            "I have one very quick.",
            "Did you consider or notice that the specific domain of December because they have all the same domain or similar related?",
            "So in some ways related to the previous question, maybe there is something intrinsic on the domain, or there are some invariants is that could impact on the degree of the composability so, but I mean if you go to another domain, would you comment there is it is possible so.",
            "So, so we claim that yes, it does work for this particular domain, and the reason we've been interested in this particular domain was because swap was built for a big like planned studies kind of project.",
            "So these are ontologies which are going to be used, so we had to take those into account first.",
            "But I agree, I mean, if it isn't possible that in some other area people just develop ontologies in a different way that like more with more licorice semantics, kind of way with more definitions, and you know it is possible, we are just not.",
            "Not there yet, but I I personally doubt it that that I think most of ontologies out there are pretty amenable to this kind of decomposition.",
            "OK, thank you so thank you for coming.",
            "I think we're ready for lunch.",
