            "This will be in next half year where we think that we have results on different object classes and it's not limited to that object classes, so it's a it's a technology when you have some samples of your object about the appearance of the object, you need samples to train train the detector.",
            "If you have that.",
            "If you have 100 or 1000 samples of an object, you can train it and then quite reliably detect that object whatever object it is, it must just look.",
