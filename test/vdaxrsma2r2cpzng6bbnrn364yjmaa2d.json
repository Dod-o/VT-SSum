            "During such a, during this three months we will have about 1.3 billion queries issued by users.",

            "Obviously, and this is what you see happening in a lot of the with a lot of the big search engine companies, they're focusing initially on the hats because if you can really answer and give a good experience to those head queries, you're actually probably able to cover 50% of your volume with just addressing the top 10% of the of the queries that you have there, right?",

            "In this case, we assume that the Livingston distance should be smaller than five, so less than five changes in characters of the query.",
