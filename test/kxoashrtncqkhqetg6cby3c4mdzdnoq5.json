            "If I want to change to an SCR model, I have to change this.",
            "I also have to think about the code as well because it assumes at the moment that it's an Sir model.",
            "You know I have to workout the how the.",
            "You need more parameters 'cause you need parameters from going from S to E and not just.",
            "Three states.",
            "OK, reset.",
            "It's also everything is commented here so reset GG is our graph.",
            "It uses a network X function set node attribute.",
            "This is the attribute name and this is the value.",
            "So reset is going to take the whole graph and make everyone susceptible.",
            "So we start from zero.",
            "Then there's a.",
            "Function to initialize an infection.",
            "G is a graph and the second parameter is a number of individuals or number of nodes to infect initially.",
            "And you'll see that it just takes a random sample, so randomly picks that number of people and changes their state.",
            "To be infected.",
            "That's it.",
            "OK, then there's a thing that creates the transmission model, so this is the thing that is executing that step that I just explained to you.",
            "So once you have an infected node, you have to then infect the neighbors.",
            "So I'm going to.",
            "In this case, it's going to execute the step on one single node, so it's going to be the node N in the graph G, right?",
            "So I've got one node and I need to infect the neighbors.",
            "OK, so first thing you should look, it says if you're if the node has a state of infected.",
            "Then I go through all the neighbors.",
            "First of all, I have to check if the neighbors acceptable because I can't infect people who are removed or people who are already infected.",
            "And then I just just generate a random number.",
            "If that random number is less than beta, then this is the infection is.",
            "Successful so I successfully infect my neighbor.",
            "So if I'm very lucky and I'll give you an idea that the values of beta that I'm using about nought point nought three, so it's a 3% chance that they infect my neighbor.",
            "So if I'm very lucky and I've got 10 neighbors, it is possible for me to infect everybody.",
            "Within one time step.",
            "Or if I make the disease very, very infectious, so it's gotta be to have one.",
            "That means I'm always going to infect all my neighbors.",
            "If you start that kind of disease, it will spread very, very fast to everyone in the network.",
            "OK, so that's this for loop here is going to go through.",
            "This step here, so I'm going to check every neighbor trying to infect it after I've tried to infect all the neighbors.",
            "What I can also then do.",
            "Is I recover?",
            "So I generate another random number and if this is less than Alpha.",
            "And I think Al from using about 0.0505% chance.",
            "Of recovery or removal.",
            "So then I change myself to be.",
            "Recovered.",
            "OK, this one we don't have to worry about.",
            "This function here is just going to get the current status of the network, so it's going to go to go through all the nodes.",
            "Check this state if they're infected, recovered, and I just make some total.",
            "So if I want to plot things, I need this information.",
            "And this is the.",
            "Basically, the thing that runs the whole simulation so runs simulation spread.",
            "I initialize infection with the function that I've just defined.",
            "And then I've got this while loop, so I'm saying, well, the length of I is my list of infected nodes.",
            "If there's still infected people in the system, I keep going.",
            "Once the infected people have gone to zero, either because everyone is dead or the infection died out, then I can stop.",
            "So I keep going until the infection has finished.",
            "Um?",
            "I execute one step of the model, which is another function.",
            "I increase my time step and then I check the current status.",
            "So what has happened in terms of the number of SI&R people?",
            "OK, something for plotting infection.",
            "If I want to visualize things every time step, I can print to a file image file the network, and then I color the nodes differently before the SI&R states so I can actually visualize maker video if I want of how this thing spreads.",
            "OK. Then if you want to use my code and if you want to do kind of an infection spread you just copy and paste all of that and then you will have the same ability to run the experiments the same way that I am doing now, OK?",
            "So if you want to just use it, this is all you have to worry about.",
            "So I make some parameters.",
            "So N is the size of the network.",
            "I make a barabasi albair graph, so a scale free network.",
            "Do you remember what this means?",
            "Chris time so N is my number of nodes.",
            "What's the parameter for the barbasol bear network?",
            "Is given the letter M. So you remember.",
            "Every time that we had one node, and then there's the number of links that we add.",
            "To that node, so it connects to the existing network.",
            "So it's the number of edges that are added along with each node.",
            "So this is my transmission model.",
            "This is beta, so this is a probability of going from or infecting, so this is how infectious diseases this is, Alpha.",
            "This is a recovery.",
            "So if this is much bigger than this, what will happen?",
            "So if Alpha is way way bigger than beta, there's going to be no disease spread.",
            "It was just the infection will die out.",
            "If this is much bigger than this.",
            "Then everyone will become infected.",
            "And then I've got another final parameter, which is my initial number of infections.",
            "So how many nodes do I initially want to infect?",
            "I don't know which ones they are.",
            "I could be lucky or unlucky, I could infect the hub, but with 10 people in a scale free network of 1000 nodes, well, I would expect is that I'm going to hit the not the hubs.",
            "I'm going to periphery nodes.",
            "OK, so I just simply set these parameters and then this is the code that I.",
            "Will use to run the simulation, so reset remember that does so.",
            "Reset takes a graph.",
            "It says all the states of the nodes to be susceptible, so initially everyone susceptible.",
            "Then this run spread simulation.",
            "I've got my my network.",
            "This is the model that I'm going to use to transmit a disease is in terms of Alpha and beta and then this is my initial number of infections, so that's why all I need to specify.",
            "What this will give me at the end is a few things sin are not going to be single values, it's going to be a list and at each point in the list is the value at that time step.",
            "So I will get a plot of the SI&R.",
            "And then I can plot with the function.",
            "So if I run this.",
            "And you will see that OK?",
            "OK, so some things to point out in this graph so.",
            "This is time step.",
            "We don't have any notion of what a time step is specifically, but you can imagine this is days.",
            "It depends on the model and the probabilities that you're using, what it actually means.",
            "And then you can notice a few things that happened so you can look at the total number of people that were infected in this disease spread simulation.",
            "So out of the 1000 people that we started with, 839 became infected.",
            "We started with 10 on the blue line here and then you see this increase.",
            "And we look at the maximum value.",
            "And this happened today 37.",
            "So what this is usually called is the peak time.",
            "So the time at which the disease spread actually.",
            "Peaked and then you've also got the peak incidence, so on that day, what was the maximum number of people infected?",
            "So this is 338 people or nodes are infected.",
            "It's about 30% of the population.",
            "And then this fraction here or the number of the green here, that's the total number that would never affected by the disease.",
            "OK.",
            "So you've got the peak time, which is the time it happens in the peak incidents and their total infected.",
            "OK, so now what we can do is we can go and play around with things.",
            "So what would you expect to happen if I?",
            "If I make the disease twice as infectious.",
            "And what I say, what do you expect to happen?",
            "You can run it yourself and then tell me.",
            "We can start to think about what will happen to this peak.",
            "Will it shift right or left?",
            "Will it decrease?",
            "What will happen?",
            "Now.",
            "What I'm about to do is not very scientific because.",
            "Well, why?",
            "Can I do a comparison like that?",
            "Because my initial infection is totally random.",
            "So if I just do one experiment of each, I might be misled because in one experiment I might hit a hub with my infection initially in another case I might not.",
            "And at the moment I have no way of telling this.",
            "But I'll try and let's see if it doesn't make sense.",
            "We know why.",
            "OK, it kind of makes sense.",
            "The other thing that you'll notice, remember, I don't specify an end time.",
            "The simulation keeps going until all the infections have died out.",
            "So the end time is also telling me how long the disease is lasting.",
            "And the last time I think it was about 1700 days and this time it's 1400.",
            "So the total number of infections or new infections, so I don't include in this 932.",
            "I don't include my initial infections of 10.",
            "So in the end, 942 people actually got the disease, 10 initially in 932 new infections.",
            "The peak time is halved.",
            "So it now only takes 17 days for the disease to actually spread, and the total on that day was 501, so this is going to be very fast.",
            "Disease now what I can do is I can make the disease more lethal.",
            "Right so.",
            "It was a big simplification that I'm doing here, but let's say like this so.",
            "Let's say remove now is not recovered, it's dead.",
            "So if a disease is really, really lethal, it will have a high probability of the people who infected going to be removed.",
            "There's one thing I don't model in this simulation.",
            "Which is important in this consideration.",
            "What's the big problem with what I just said about?",
            "If a disease is very, very deadly?",
            "OK, well let's just think about what do you think will happen with this simulation.",
            "Everyone dies.",
            "We have to think about those three values of peak time.",
            "Peak incidence in the total infected, so the last simulation where this was.",
            "No point, not 5, right?",
            "We ended up with 930 people.",
            "Infected.",
            "Will this be more or less?",
            "OK.",
            "There's a lot less.",
            "So the whole thing only lasted 25 days.",
            "And then I'll.",
            "Peak incidence was 60, which is only six times the original infection and this happened on Day 9.",
            "And 198 people in this case died.",
            "So sometimes the well.",
            "Obviously if the disease is too lethal, it's going to be self limiting and kill itself off.",
            "So you have to have the right kind of balanced.",
            "To do these things?",
            "Why is that so?",
            "If I model the deadliness of the disease in this way, why is it not correct?",
            "What does a model miss?",
            "Mutation is one thing, yeah, but even without mutations.",
            "Thus you mean the population increasing.",
            "Also one thing, but it's even simpler than that.",
            "So the problem with the way the infection spreads in this case is I get.",
            "So the the person starts infected and in one time step they try to infect the neighbors.",
            "So my infection probability is 6%.",
            "So if I've got.",
            "60 neighbors right.",
            "I'm only going to manage to get.",
            "Six of those, right?",
            "So if I have 100 numbers, I'll get six of those.",
            "Let's just say 100.",
            "I get six of those infected, then immediately I have a 30% chance, 35% chance of dying.",
            "So the model just as soon as I'm infected.",
            "Every time step I have 35% chance of dying, so on average I'm only going to last three time steps before I die off, so my ability to spread is going to be limited.",
            "Most diseases don't work this way, they will have some at least some kind of period of making you sick so that you stay in the population for awhile and then infect, infect more people.",
            "At the moment we have no way of modeling the idea of a deadly disease plus one which can be long lasting.",
            "Well, the incubation periods slight different.",
            "That means that you're exposed to the disease, but you're not infectious yet.",
            "Right, this is this is again something something different.",
            "OK, so let's put these back to something more reasonable.",
            "OK, so I run the same thing again and now I get slightly different.",
            "The disease lasted quite a bit longer.",
            "It was 2300.",
            "By the way, the way the code is working every time I rerun the simulation, it generates a new network.",
            "Alright, so I'm getting a different network terminal.",
            "I think.",
            "I do it here, right?",
            "So I create a new network so it's a barabasi al bear with the same parameters, but there's no nothing to say that that's not going to look quite different to the first one.",
            "OK, so now we want to do some vaccinations.",
            "So how do we actually do the vaccinations in this model?",
            "Assuming that vaccinations are 100% effective, so.",
            "Yeah, so you just start some of the population with.",
            "So once they are in the recovered state, that means they are immune to the disease.",
            "So you can do that by killing people.",
            "Or you can do it in a nicer way of actually giving them some drugs to make them not catch the disease.",
            "Whoops I don't know what just happened, OK?",
            "So I've got a parameter number to vaccinate, so that's the number of people that I'm going to vaccinate 50.",
            "And then again, I've made another function which is just going to vaccines cause vaccinate by degree.",
            "I calculate the degree.",
            "We've seen this function before of all the nodes.",
            "I then sort them.",
            "Based on degree.",
            "And then I just get the idea of the node that I want to vaccinate.",
            "So I just ordered the top 50.",
            "Nodes based on degree and I give them all a vaccine or I move all their states to be in the remove state.",
            "So.",
            "What do you think will happen?",
            "Let's try.",
            "So this is the top 50 most connected nodes in the network are all now initially removed.",
            "And I ran the same simulation that I did before, where I had a peak incidence of.",
            "I don't know 300 and a peak day of 30.",
            "In the end, 500 people still are infected.",
            "And the other thing that you'll notice is that the disease is prevalent for a lot longer.",
            "It never has a big peak, but it just manages to survive in the system for quite some time.",
            "I can now just test this with ten.",
            "What do you think will happen with 10?",
            "So we turn.",
            "I still got a shift from the original peak day of 30, but I'm still getting quite a lot of people infected, so 10 doesn't seem to be having much impact.",
            "So make this 100 so the 100 top.",
            "Connected nodes in the system.",
            "Then I start to actually really affect the spread of the disease quite a bit, so there's still 10 people initially infected 100 are initially vaccinated and.",
            "Even so, I still get.",
            "205 new infections.",
            "Difference between this and this is basically the initial infections and the initial removed people, so 110.",
            "OK, so that's one kind of strategy that I can employ.",
            "And this is assuming complete global knowledge of the system, so I can identify who the hubs are.",
            "The other option is between us so I can order the nodes by between us and then try the one with the highest between us to see if that.",
            "That works.",
            "So I still got this set to let's make this 50 again.",
            "Between us takes longer because you have to calculate between centrality and that takes time.",
            "Great.",
            "So.",
            "Here I take vaccinated the top 50 based on degree and here I've vaccinated the top 50 based on between us.",
            "It doesn't seem to make that much difference, right?",
            "But again, I'm running one simulation so I could be completely misled.",
            "Because I got lucky.",
            "So I did include some bonus code as well.",
            "So this just shows one of the kind of.",
            "What I'm using to plot the graphs previously was this logical matplotlib.",
            "This one uses another one called Boca, which.",
            "Allows you to have interactive graphs inside, which can be useful.",
            "There is a way to zoom in as well and do things.",
            "But you can actually in some ways.",
            "It's actually easier to plot with this because it's 3 lines of code instead of about 20.",
            "OK, so now you can start to think about.",
            "OK, let's.",
            "Try a strategy with incomplete information so if you don't have the whole network, how do you vaccinate?",
            "So if you can't order based on degree, try something else.",
            "And what I've also added in this.",
            "This is similar.",
            "System to what we that we did with the with the robustness so not running one simulation but running a number.",
            "So again, I have not a single parameter at the top.",
            "Now I fix the network size to be one value.",
            "I then have a transmission model which I fixed so I know the disease parameters.",
            "But then I can vary the fraction of initial infections.",
            "So this is.",
            "10 to the minus 310 to the minus two sorry five 2 * 10 to the minus three 5 * 10 to the minus two 5 * 10 to the minus three 5 * 17 -- 2 or 1 * 10 to minus two.",
            "This is a fraction of the total population that I'm going to vaccinate or infect, right?",
            "So these are numbers between zero and one.",
            "And then I have two methods.",
            "So I have one vaccinate by degree and one vaccinate by between us.",
            "These names the the the strings.",
            "There they correspond to the name to the functions that I'm using to actually execute the vaccination strategy.",
            "So if you made a third one yourself, just make another function and add it there.",
            "So what this piece of code here will do is take those sets of parameters.",
            "So two values that I've got for initial infection, two values that I've got for vaccination.",
            "Initial vaccination count and two variations of the method.",
            "So how many experiments do I have in total?",
            "Oh, and I have a repetition, so for every parameter set I'm going to repeat it three times.",
            "So I run this one with this one and with this one and then this one with this one and this one and so on and so on.",
