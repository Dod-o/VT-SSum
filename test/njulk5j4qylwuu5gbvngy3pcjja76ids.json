            "Another existing time ontologies.",
            "So now some next steps here would be to actually go and revisit the messy duration accents and they really are are messy, so it's going to be quite a challenge, so that's one step there and the other step is to look at how eventualities and those axioms are related to existing process ontologies.",
            "So with time again, there's a lot of work that's been done over the decades, and so we're able to do a very rich mapping into all the existing time ontologies with process ontologies, not such a rich collection.",
            "And so that's kind of another thing we want to be able to do.",
            "Thank you very much.",
            "So around the turn of the last century for the Hilbert work, for example, a lot of the non Euclidean geometry's were just beginning to emerge and when you put in axioms or when you take out axioms for example that require that perpendicular lines meet only once you get closer to what modern physics is sees as time.",
            "Do you think you can extend this stuff to to what physicists would be interested in currently in quantum mechanical problems?",
            "Oh yeah, no, that's that's that's really interesting question.",
            "So one of the things that we also want to try to do in general with ontology construction is really, really motivated by certain kinds of problems that people have.",
            "An so definitely that if we wanted to look at particular kinds of applications to understand well what time ontology does, that particular application need and and definitely kind of use that sort of idea.",
            "Yeah, yeah, like you have venom in his logic of time.",
            "Kind of looks at some other relativistic time etc.",
            "And then looking at those particular models there.",
            "But those weren't really axiomatized actually, so there's a lot of classes of of models that I actually haven't maximized and put into our repository, so I'd be interesting kind of extension.",
            "If I understood right, then for your for your approach you need some known theories right?",
            "What if there are no known theories in order to characterize the ontology?",
            "Did you have this this case also?",
            "Well, yeah, actually the this particular case here.",
            "This class of theories really didn't exist before hand, and so we had to kind of reconstruct that ourselves in a way so so in a in a worst case scenario, what we're doing is creating.",
            "New problems for mathematicians, which might be nice.",
            "I know that you're creating new mathematics in a way because if you want to try to again, reduce everything that you are trying to understand better into something that is well understood and there are going to be cases where we in fact do introduce new mathematics, OK, maybe that's being a little overblown, but you know there is a certain possibility.",
            "But doesn't that mean that you have to construct these models actually, right?",
            "So that's kind of what we know what ended up happening.",
            "See here to this bottom theorem here.",
            "Kind of shows how that class of structures bottoms out in a very kind of obvious construction sort of way, and so that's what you would have to do this like with lattices, you use the stone representation theorem, so how lattices can be built up from sets of sets and so on.",
            "So there's always a case where you bought him out on some very explicit sort of construction.",
            "Thanks for the very interesting presentation.",
            "I just quickly want to ask about the missing axioms you mentioned that you identify those just to clarify, what were those?",
            "So when one axiom being the linearly ordering over time points that are inside an interval, so the end points have to be linearly ordered, but the original axioms allow them to have to be incomparable if they are inside.",
            "And the other additional axioms revealed that guaranteed that the endpoints of a time interval or not inside the interval.",
            "Now that was again a quote up there.",
            "So that was an original intended model, so you know if the authors original authors could say, well, OK. We actually found out that maybe will relax that requirement and so in that case you could say OK with.",
            "These accents weren't needed, but then you would go back and change the definition of the intended models.",
            "So there's always that kind of dialogue between ontology design.",
            "An apology verification.",
            "There were a few other axioms that like sort axioms to say, for example that.",
            "Certain things are eventualities.",
            "You know that the arguments have to be typed, etc.",
            "But those are trivial.",
            "Little accident.",

            "Draw too much attention.",
            "These were the more interesting accents that were missing.",
