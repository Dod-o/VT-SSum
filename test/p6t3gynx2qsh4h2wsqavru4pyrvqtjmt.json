            "In progress in terms of implementation, but the ability for users to query back so you can say I would like data in the last six months and then that gives us a way to filter out all the old data and just focus the reasoning on the newer data, sure, But if last six months is pretty much the same as today, then that you could easily shrink the same data.",

            "We took the original data and convert it into RDF, but really what it comes down to in terms of the user interface is knowing what sources are available and then using that as a selection mechanism.",
            "So we can say.",
            "Well, you know, here's a list of all the sources, so right now USGS EPA.",
            "If you don't want to use the USGS data because you're not interested in it or for some other reason, you uncheck that box and then by looking at the graph, we can see.",
            "OK. Well, what graphs here are from the USGS and will just exclude those from our query.",
            "Rather, what we really do is we look at the remaining items and say, OK, well these will be included as part of the queries.",

            "At least part of them, and if you use real time data sources then why not focused that area instead of a check?",
            "When did it happen?",
            "So maybe you can create alerts so you can just say I think there's gonna be a diarrhea somewhere using the data instead of checking afterwards.",
            "OK, so I actually had someone suggested this to me last night during the demo session of doing some sort of Google style approach where you look at what types of health effects people are looking for and using that as a way of kind of predicting if there's something going on prior to getting the data.",
            "Because the data has a lead time of three months or six months or however long happens to be and so.",
            "You could do.",
            "You could do something like that.",
            "I mean, that's not particularly our interest area, but you know if we provide that information, there's no reason why you couldn't do that type of prediction.",

            "Yeah, OK. Yeah, it would be nice.",
            "As you know we are as we say, we're trying to talk to other people to see if we can get data that is more reasonable than one month intervals.",

            "Obviously that's not very useful when you have a disease that passes day today.",
            "At the moment we don't have those available, but we are looking for people who can help us get those types of data.",
            "If you did have that information, it certainly would be worthwhile to generate emails and things like that to notify people and know that you know if for some reason.",
            "This particular characteristic is climbing at the real time source.",
            "Maybe we could alert the EPA or somebody automatically and let them know so that they could check out further downstream at a water pollution plan or something like that.",
            "And 1 technical question, how did you implement regulations?",
            "Is it?",
            "Is it rather rule based or so we've been using the owl to data type restrictions, so use that to express the range of values that are acceptable.",
            "Within the for a particular regulation, and then we also tide into looking at the value of the the unit, the value of the characteristic on the measurement and with an intersection we actually have Alta grabbing all that and pulling it out so that we can classify.",
            "Allocated, just follow up on that.",
            "The real time alerting one.",
            "It seems to me that one of the real issues here in this goes to the sort of you know ever growing data set is that if you're doing a lot of the reasoning at runtime that you're actually good, then going to have a scalability issue is that is that sort of a correct assumption from your architecture.",
            "Yes, but like I said, we're putting in mechanisms to try to limit what data is coming out right.",
            "So the idea that you could look at the last six months and one of the nice things about this was the idea that a user could come in and ask questions about different things, right?",
            "So it's one thing that Rhode Island collects data and then applies the Rhode Island regulations to it.",
            "I mean, they already do that, but they don't come in and collect the Rhode Island data and then apply the California regulations to it, and so we'd like to be able to allow the user to swap that in.",
            "And we could compute all possible permutations.",
            "But that probably is just as effective as doing it at runtime, and certainly you'd have to store it somewhere, and we're not sure where we would do that yet.",
