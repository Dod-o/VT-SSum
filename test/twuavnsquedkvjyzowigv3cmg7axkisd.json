            "Very important in our application because we are not a PDM, we're not a software for developing a product, but to control the network of developing.",
            "For richer product we can add a list of activities.",
            "What are the least?",
            "V's activities are all the activities necessary to implement to provide, to produce any activities that are necessary.",

            "It's a typical treeview.",
            "And now it's very we do very simple structure just to put the metal elements and that solar.",
            "OK, so this is like it's similar to a PDM about it's more more more light.",
            "Adjust the two define relation between components becausw it will be useful in the definition of our network and the definition of the what we called the suggested Gantt for your activities inside of a network show you later for each node.",
            "OK you can add the sum.",
            "Any kind of attribute that will be useful for you to control.",

            "With this product we call company product with single subpart of the with product in this case and other one provided in the preparation phase and we call this VR product are the result of the network are so this is the process of a video product which is different from the process of the company product.",
            "What is this possible to do?",
            "Is it to?",

            "OK, an I left there was a show you but it's not possible to do these in the foreseen duration.",

            "For example typical we have web services.",
            "So we use an XML.",
            "Communication of information.",

            "Week APIs, is and so on.",
            "Any questions?",
            "Please.",
            "Certain structure which.",

            "It's quite free and you can jump to and activities in freeway.",
            "I'm, but in the future we would like to add a.",
            "Also what we call a wizard and to help you in the specific phase if you are in preparation phase.",
            "What are the action that I needed to do inside the application for the preparation failed?",
            "For example what I described to instead of a product?",
            "I've a process and so on and the same for the setup phase, not for operational phase.",
            "Becauses variable life.",
            "So everything could happen.",
            "But what is important is the usual is the amount of data available and variation between amount just to have the capacity to control the workflow.",
            "We don't want to define as can you notice never design.",
            "I draw a workflow of any kind.",
            "There is very simple workflow for the preparation data and user data and that's all becausw.",
            "First of all, there is difficult to have a workflow that are useful for all kind of company.",
            "Also in theater we have a lot of a situation.",
            "We have tested a lot of very expensive also application to manage workflow.",
            "But result was with the timeout you define the workflow.",
            "So you think about all the situation over possible over trigger for manager situation, wrong situation and so on.",
            "Becomes obsolete it sold because you think one year in one year in our today is completely change everything above.",
            "For example for the cars.",
            "But we insert knew infotainment equipment and so on.",
            "So we think also that for a small and medium component which is the target of a visa software.",
            "Open more often because we have an idea of a tier of Aviva companies.",
            "We know what we have typical 3 level of attires.",
            "We have a Tier 1 which is that the supplier data directly speak with us.",
            "We collaborated for the developer for example in your car.",
            "Then we have a tier of a second level with a supplier of our suppliers and typical.",
            "We go deeper for free.",
            "So for level, so at three or four level.",
            "They are lucky because they have to follow all the changes above so they live in a situation of a.",
            "Everyday changes everything, so because if they don't know the world process an so very severe cold front tomorrow I need visa or what happens?",
            "I need to change something so we know that it is necessary to have something smart and after so closed for proper point of approaches.",

            "Ever is a definition of a workflow overstep overflow?",
            "Second question.",
            "Is this application of design to be hosted or yes OK distributed to the users?",
            "In what way?",
            "Paid unpaid, yes.",
            "We think it as.",
            "An application via architecture is defined.",
            "It's dependent.",
            "The problem is not from the technical point of view because it's a web application, so it's very easy to ask that this application, for example inside the provider.",
            "Then all the company for a network and connected to this provider.",
            "We have a problem about the security of data because OK to store data inside the database is something that is important uses for the company.",
            "So we designed the architecture in different way.",
            "You can store everything inside of your company if you are a medium company.",
            "If you are a small company, you can have the engine outside the service and so, but this way database could be inside you or better in intermediate zone between your Internet and their silent and or completely out.",

            "Do you mean the result of an actor is a sample for your company specific presentation that you showed right?",
            "Yeah, this product that you displayed OK could be something just only for me.",
            "That is because I wanted to earn money from this product.",
            "OK, like for example fear to sell a car or a could be a product of it will be a.",

            "Remain in connector.",
            "What you did was you developed this concept based on the view of principles, and now you're looking forward to integrating this with the larger applications or whatever you are want to have and you want this to be.",

            "Yeah right.",

            "You're seeing that it is cost driven, so somebody has to pay for it.",
            "You pay that you pay the use or you pay the installation inside the your company just depend on what kind of solution we want to to have.",
            "At this moment.",
            "The application that you presented.",

            "For example, from from from kogas how much money now you're wasting by not using such a platform?",
            "How much money do you think you can save by using such a problem, then automatically how much you could afford to pay for something like that?",
            "Then we will do that.",
            "Question is being answered or being.",
            "Yeah, next.",
            "Going to Althea cheap Partners to get an idea about about the integration costs, about the maintenance cost, customizing 'cause, then we're getting getting full cost plan and based on that we are going to set up a business planners so in equal what has happened is before you went to the market to do the survey, there was an application design and application was presented as a platform to assess what market has potential for for this kind of the big problem was that.",
            "Such a platform is still unique to our knowledge.",
            "And even if you do such and such a survey on in Eastern Europe, it's really difficult.",
