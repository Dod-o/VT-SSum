            "Thank you very much.",
            "Questions.",
            "So.",
            "It makes sense that.",
            "You're finding a clustering model that is more robust to noise by finding that kind of optimal.",
            "But how do you define the noise model itself?",
            "Change that noise model, then it changed.",
            "Cluster bomb the noise.",
            "The noise model is not explicitly defined.",
            "What you what you, what you what you bet on here is that that you have a sufficiently large instance.",
            "So from the point of view of.",
            "Of estimating the probability distribution of your data, you have only one realization.",
            "But it's like in statistical physics.",
            "If you have a sufficiently large instance, once you can make statements about about macroscopic quantities and the channel capacity is such a macroscopic quantity, and even if you if you use clustering for segmenting an image, all the pixels are coupled.",
            "However, they provide you a lot of statistics to estimate probability distributions on clustering, which only consider pairwise.",
            "Correlations, and not any higher order statistics.",
            "So if you don't specify a noise model, where do you get your second data set from?",
            "Well, oh, in practice, what we did so far we we used resampling approaches.",
            "For doing the analysis, it's very clear you need, you need to consult the Oracle the problem generator twice.",
            "If you if you don't have a second data set, you can.",
            "You cannot make an argument against against somebody who claims that this is a deterministic instance, and he insists on getting the global minimum.",
            "Question, so if you need and use a second sample you you said you mentioned optimizing over metric of our cost function.",
            "So for each new metric you try you need a number, not a sample.",
            "No, you have you have you have two.",
            "You have two cost functions.",
            "You have two samples X1 and X2.",
            "You use them for the cost function, R1 to communicate and you use them also for the cost function R2.",
            "These are two independent parallel processes and for the first for the first for the first cost function you get a number of bits and for the second one you get also a number of bits and you choose the model which has the higher number of bits.",
            "Yeah, for two cost function, yes, but you cannot run over all cost functions, otherwise you get over 50.",
            "Why should you get overfitting you?",
            "You might get saturation.",
            "You might find out that if your instances not not sufficiently large that that the statistical fluctuations when we talk non asymptotic's Shannon theorem is an asymptotic theory.",
            "When we talk non asymptotically you have a finite resolution of your empirically estimated channel capacity and this finite resolution basically then prevents you from saying cost function R1 is better than R2.",
            "Yeah, it would be also handy to get more instances and to have a final Test, because the more you know about your probability distribution, the better you can design your code very clearly.",
            "But there are two limits you can.",
            "You can make one instance very large.",
            "Well, you can have many smaller instances to to accumulate Eurosceptics well.",
            "In practice here one data set and you had to re sample and you exactly exactly.",
            "That's what we do.",
            "But that's what every statistician is doing.",
            "That's why they they they they invented.",
            "Bootstrap sure yeah yeah yeah yeah.",
            "So if I understood you, you've got.",
            "You are looking at this issue of stability like in supervised learning.",
            "We now know a lot about how to do this right?",
            "So you're not coming over here not being led misled by the particular data sample that you've got.",
            "You want to do that to control the particular clustering method that you want to do.",
            "That's the problem statement, right?",
            "So that's kind of you know in end user land.",
            "That's what it is that you want to do.",
            "Then you've described a particular way of doing this.",
            "Where you start, you know, conceiving it as a communication problem and then you introduce these information theoretic quantities.",
            "How clean a break is there?",
            "I mean this way just watching your single talk by couldn't disentangle the statement of the problem versus your particular way of solving it.",
            "Another way of putting my confusion to you is, could you conceive of alternate ways of stating this.",
            "Admin blend use problem that isn't appealing to Shannon.",
            "Information theory, mutual information, etc.",
            "Yeah, you could probably think about.",
            "A comperable approach using Kolmogorov complexity or some other information measure.",
            "I'm happy to hear that right?",
            "No no, but it's better than one, but then it comes with other with other issues, however.",
            "I I think I think information theory is very fundamentally in the following sense.",
            "If you can't use it for a communication process, then please explain to me why you still believe that the results are trustworthy.",
            "If you have repeatable answers of your data analysis, I can convert them in in a symbolic representation, and that is my code.",
            "And then I use it in a communication scenario and whether you call it in communication or whether you call it rate distortion theory.",
            "This is dual of the same thing, so so you can reformulate that within the different.",
            "I think in a nutshell, what you're saying is that if you've got this reliability, this stability on samples, then you do have a way of constructing your communication scheme.",
            "Since you've got a communication scheme, you might as well use information theory exactly your argument but but, but it gives you not only stability, you can have stability.",
            "Are boring results and nobody is interested in, for example, a clustering of in face recognition, where you where you cluster the objects into into into those phases where the light comes from the right and where the light comes from the left.",
            "And quite often we actually realized that because when you when you do face recognition, many people throw away the leading PCA components and they have something to do with the lighting and not with the face identity.",
            "So you have a tradeoff between stability and richness and you want to have.",
            "And a search procedure.",
            "Toilets models which are rich.",
            "So that that you actually in a hierarchical fashion, then can find out from a post consideration of post processing consideration what kind of structures you really like.",
            "But this comes as in is as in classification.",
            "This comes as a risk analysis at top of it and it should be separated from the underlying principle of clustering, which basically in my case is defined as partitioning."
