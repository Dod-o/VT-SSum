            "Alright, so here's why it's so neat.",
            "First of all, what this does is besides generalizing the person, it also generalizes two other very very famous and useful distributions.",
            "One is the Bernoulli.",
            "If you take new to Infinity, you actually get a Bernoulli distribution.",
            "With a P, the probability of success is I think Lambda over one plus Lambda.",
            "And if you take new equal to 0 and you have to restrict Lambda to be less than one, then you get a geometric distribution that counts the number of trials until the first failure.",
            "OK, so kind of a cool generalization.",
            "Now what's interesting here is notice that new is supposed to be positive, non negative right?",
            "So if you take it from zero you go through one and then you go to Infinity.",
            "You cover a huge range of dispersion.",
            "When you have a Bernoulli distribution of zeros and ones right?",
            "So that's totally under dispersed under this person means that the variance is much smaller than me.",
            "When you read the person, they are equal.",
            "The variance in the mean are equal and then when you move towards the geometric when you hit any numbers above 1, you're in the overdispersion case where the variance can be much bigger than the mean, and again these are lots and lots of shapes that you can have for your data.",
            "Now, here's again that probability distribution here is that the function and notice another nice property of this thing is if you take consecutive probabilities, then in the person case you would just have something linear.",
            "Whereas now it's nonlinear, so it allows you to have much longer tails or much shorter tails.",
            "OK, the dying between consecutive probabilities can be much faster, slower than linear, and that's what the flexibility basically means in another way."
        ],
        [
            "Alright, so this is 1 huge thing.",
            "Now don't underestimate what it means to have one distribution that captures a whole range of over an underdispersion relative to a pass on the negative binomial, which is again the next default when the person doesn't work, can only model overdispersion, it can't do underdispersion.",
            "So if you need underdispersion, you'll have to find something else.",
            "And if you want something that is both, you'll have to look a little more.",
            "Now there are few other distributions, I'll show them soon, but this one is really neat because it only has two parameters annual.",

            "Yeah few people.",
            "OK if some nice distributions like the normal distribution in the exponential distribution they belong to this family and the way you can break it down is that basically you have the parameters separated in certain a certain way from the data.",
            "The data are the wise here and what I highlighted here called sufficient statistics.",
            "And when you have an exponential family you will always have sufficient statistics and what this means is that you don't need to give me all the data whether it's 1 million records or one gazillion records.",
            "All I need to know in order to do any estimation is I need to know these two numbers.",
            "I need the sum of your accounts and I need the sum of the log factorials.",

            "There are a lot of other properties that are nice.",

Sorry in PowerPoint, Microsoft turned our new Internet so you can actually estimate Lambda new very roughly in nicely and quickly from the slope and from the Intercept, but there's one small trick you can just do a normal regression up there linear regression, because if you look at these things right, each observation is a ratio of proportion of tools to ones.",
