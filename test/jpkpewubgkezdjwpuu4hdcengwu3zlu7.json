            "So I think it's important, of course to think about the new challenges in terms of what should we be changing in the schooling system, but I think higher education has got such a huge responsibility because actually higher education is covering everyone from, let's say the 8 of 20 onwards.",

            "The disappointing part of this story is they found that the universities have been the least flexible partners, so they've actually started developing something which only sees a very small role for higher education, and I I talked to the Director for Learning Development at this bank, and she said in the past what would happen is if we wanted to.",
            "If we if we wanted to kind of upskill our employees, we would send our student away or send our employer away to do like a Bachelor or master course and they said we don't do this anymore because what was coming back wasn't exactly what we wanted.",
            "So now we work much more closely with the providers, but she said what we do is we designed the course and then we go to the University and say have you got someone who could provide this and this program for us based on what we think we need.",
            "I was disappointed when I heard that because I think it should be the role of higher education to be much more actively involved in this.",
            "So this is, I think, both a challenge for employers to think much more about skills development instead of just complaining about skills gaps.",
            "But I think it's a challenge for higher education as well to try and put ourselves in the position of employers as well and try and think about what exactly do they need instead of saying well, look, I've got, you know.",

            "Which of those 10 are you going to take?",

            "One question concerning learners motivation to be included.",
            "Is this only the pressure of the market or we should prepare people to really include it because they need to get new knowledge or how we can manage to get them actively inside?",
            "So I so the question is about, yeah motivation.",
            "I think of of learners and particularly, you know I focused a lot in my work in the past on on what we sometimes call vulnerable groups are under represented groups and we often find their motivation is also lacking, but it's lacking because they've had very bad experience in the education system.",
            "So part of the way we ensure their motivation is we recognize what these people have achieved so far and try and kind of pull them into the system.",
            "But the the I think motivation and self organization are both very key elements that you mentioned because the other point is.",
            "We find that purely digital offers also offers of most of the open universities are mostly taken up by people who've already achieved higher education, so they already have this kind of skill to learning, so this is something we have to be providing in our school system, but it's something that we also as higher education providers have to think about how we can support students more, and the problem of this kind of support until now has been it's not really scalable, so.",
            "Some of us might do these great things of you know, supporting individual students, but it's difficult to expand that then to all of your students.",
            "And there I think going forward things like you know the application of artificial intelligence into systems can help that to some extent, but it's a huge challenge.",
            "I totally agree with you.",
            "If you would have unlimited financial and human resources, what would be your Blue Sky project?",
            "Unlimited did you say yeah well?",
            "Exactly this point actually have how to how to enable the kind of support that students need in a way that it that it's scalable, and I think because for me, that's the biggest challenge and that's why I mentioned already that thinking about support and advice as part of the didactical package is super important, and we've tended to think about that in using the term pedagogy when we think about schooling.",
            "But very often we don't think about it on a tertiary education level because we think.",
            "Well, they're already adults.",
            "They should be able to do it, but particularly now this is such an important aspect, so it's mentioned very briefly that I'm working for Kieran and we've got a platform which is to support refugees.",
            "We're going through exactly this transition point at the moment as well, so we had a lot of personal support for our individual students, but we've notice it's not scalable, and therefore we can't offer our services to more and more refugees is, which is what we want.",
            "So this is we need this technical solution for this, but I think the whole point is to think about what the big problem is first and then think how technology can help.",
            "We tend to normally think the other way around.",
            "Oh, OK, now we've got AI.",
            "What can it do?",
            "I don't agree with that way, but that would be my blue Sky sync so.",
            "Give me the money, let's do it.",
            "You mentioned the lack of flexibility of the universities in designing the study programs, but I argue that things are a little bit more complicated than that.",
            "In Europe, and I know for a fact in Slovenia we developed extremely complicated and sophisticated system of evaluation of this quality of the study programs and you if you add to that the mechanisms run by the government in ministries of financing.",
            "Basically you lock the creativity of the University and hinder severely the flexibility when it comes to designing new programs.",
            "So I think we should.",
            "I think a little bit more broader picture in easing the design of new programs.",
            "I totally agree with you, this is something I also mentioned yesterday.",
            "My so before I started working on this and also focusing on vulnerable groups, I was very focused on the whole questions of governance and I've been doing it for the last 20 years.",
            "When we started all of this with this was called new public management and it was really to do with the fact of let's give universities more autonomy in terms of less dirigiste IK control directly from ministries and then kind of the other side was OK.",
            "Therefore we need quality assurance.",
            "And you mentioned the funding as well.",
            "We need for example, performance based funding.",
            "I think we're at a stage now where this has all gone too far and we wrote a.",
            "We wrote an article myself and a colleague from Canada last year, which was to do with.",
            "We looked at the indicators being used for performance based funding and asked ourselves what is the implicit understanding of student success.",
            "And essentially what's happening is some of these systems.",
            "They're just stopping universities being more flexible as you say, so one of the things is if you have performance based funding, which is based on graduate numbers, which seems at first instance very, very sensible.",
            "What you're saying is, you're only going to pay that University once the student has been through all the different years of their study and finally finished their Bachelor or their Masters.",
            "If we then say wait, but we would like, we would like students to be moving, for example, and do maybe some of their battery at one University and Summit another, which is many of many of our systems had this tradition in the past as well.",
            "This is this is there's there's no incentive.",
            "Therefore universities to offer that kind of thing because they say, well, we're only going to be paid for graduates, so we want to keep the students as long as possible.",
            "So a lot of these governance methods that have been implemented until now have started to really reduce the flexibility of University.",
            "So I agree with that.",
            "I think in terms of quality assurance there is currently in many countries.",
            "A new development to say, well, maybe we should really think about it, so I've been in discussions with some quality assurance agencies about this, so I think there's a recognition of the problem, but I think you know we've had 20 years or so of this new public management.",
            "It's really the time that we rethink it now and think, how do we?",
            "How can we allow universities to be more flexible?",
