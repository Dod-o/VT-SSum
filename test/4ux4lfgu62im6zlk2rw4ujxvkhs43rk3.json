            "So I proposed the sentences which it finds the matches inside.",

            "So this was done on Summer Oppian project as an example of reasoning and it took me maybe three or four days to actually entered the knowledge inside.",
            "Here that psych was able to answer this question.",
            "So what what it what you did basically is.",
            "It answered so this truck it would say there's A tag or something with this registration plate.",
            "And then here is the explanation why this track can drive the shipment order.",

            "And it found out this is a shipment document and the maximum temperature of it is minus 5 degrees.",
            "So it found out from the stuff which was on the shipment document because it was fish.",

            "But for in order to make this work I had to enter about this track that it has.",
            "The refrigerator and how could how cool is that?",
            "How was the lowest temperature it can do?",
            "I have to tell it about what the fish the fish fillets are and that they are mid and I had to find to enter a rule that if something is meeting it needs to be refrigerated when you drive it.",
            "So it was quite complicated to do it so.",
            "So basically if we could do this kind of knowledge if we can find this knowledge automatically, it would really make these things easier and faster to do it.",

            "The deal with this example was that it was connecting to the already existing database in the company in the company.",
            "So I have to point him OK, this column in the database is the track.",
            "This column is the shipment orders.",
            "This column is the items on the shipment order and so on.",
            "And then it basically find out automate it took the knowledge from there it took the instances from there, but the class is the exact knowledge I had to enter before hand.",
            "So relationship from here to let's say your PhD topic would be that.",
            "These kind of problems would be could be done by collecting information from the social setting right?",
            "Yeah, so yeah.",
            "So for trucks.",
            "So this can be applied to many domains, so even in this example, basically the I didn't show everything but be so on the when I was showing this on this project before there is a before that I was opening this shipment document and it was listed there but it is on it and then it was basically asking me what's that was that and I had so it was a bit of knowledge acquisition already but still still a lot of things had to be done."

            "So this was part of the motivation.",

            "And this is another instance based on the same platform.",
            "So basically what this was, we were located, there were six or installing sensors.",
            "And they wanted to have, so to annotate them a bit, so they wanted to know where they are and where they are mounted on.",
            "And whether there are trees around, and so I modified this application for just for them.",
            "So basically you scan the sensor code and the sensors were equipped with clear code.",
            "We scanned it and then the system was asking a bit about that sensor.",
            "So the idea is that there is a back end which can do the acquisition and then you can do a more versions of fit there.",
            "So this is another thing is an application which we're doing together with Cycorp Ann is meant.",
            "It's a bit like personal assistant, which learns about your world and tries to figure out a lot about you and a lot about stuff you're doing and later on we will add.",
            "So now it's just learning it, doesn't.",
            "It doesn't do it.",
            "Does a bit feedback, but we turn off the the part where you can ask questions.",
            "So basically when we will have enough data and users will turn that on and you could kind of interact with the system in natural language or partially in natural language.",
            "And basically machine will be asking you questions and you people can ask questions as well.",
            "So I'll show a bit of them with this now.",
            "I didn't have time to buy the cable, so I have it will be lagging a bit.",
            "Teen people going from yeah, so it's possible to connect phone directly to the laptop, but not now.",
            "It will be a bit slow, but so basically how it's here is you see the conversation.",
            "So this is zero and this is the cat.",
            "And then here you have an options for input.",
            "So sometimes you have predefined dialogues you can just click and sometimes you can enter free free text.",

            "Here you can see the other the other users were doing or asking.",
            "Here are the points, because each time you answer it teaches something it's happening.",
            "It happened, you earn points and here you have very where we are now and a bit of location history.",
            "If you click on this and this guy makes it find your location if you click it, it does this automatically as well.",
            "But if you want to force it you click on this guy.",
            "So basically I will.",
            "Do this now and I will lie a bit to it that we are in some bar just to show that it will ask about it.",
            "So it's OK.",
            "In meantime, I can show the.",

            "OK, now it's asking whether we're at the JSII will lie to it and say we are in some bar nearby.",

            "Home.",
            "So now I know Internet is a cafe and then it wasn't sure which kind of cafe.",
            "I thought that site ask again and then I selected that it's an organization.",
            "And now it's it wants to know a bit more about it.",
            "So it will.",
            "Ask all sorts of questions, but the one I wanted is it also asks about the visit there so it will at some point it will ask me.",
            "What I ordered there and with who I am there so it's kind of learning about the to learn about the the menu items they have in the prices and how we did it is that when you answer something so some questions are just answered and then it goes on.",
            "But for some questions they have followups.",
            "When you answer with something then it it because of your answer it asks you more about the thing or it starts to be more so.",
            "For example if you are I'll come to this question.",
            "Um?",
            "It's not no business.",

            "Um, something.",
            "So lucky.",
            "Yeah it it won't know what is break probably.",
            "And now it's.",
            "So when it doesn't know what it is, so this is the basically the Knowledge acquisition part.",
            "It knows that it has to be food or drink.",
            "And but it doesn't know where exactly in this.",
            "In this ontology to store it.",
            "So that's why it ask a bit more so, but for break it won't because it doesn't even recognize anything from the text.",
            "But for example, if inside this ontology would be some something which would already.",
            "So under this tree, if there would be something some item which would have somehow the same.",
            "The same name in it, it would mask whether it's this or now.",
            "It will be just.",
            "It just ask whether whether it's food and drink or type of addition later on it will ask more questions about that to define it more.",
            "So you can enter a new type.",
            "You can, and sometimes you can enter it.",
            "So it depends how much it finds.",
            "So in this example not but.",
            "May I say it's food, food, or drink, but there's another bit an error.",
            "It's food or drink.",
            "I'll show, I'll explain this later on so I have directed exact exam example, not about Bullock, but about some.",
            "Some other things.",
            "So, but what I'm trying to show now now it should ask what's the price?",
            "OK, now it's inferred that if I order it, it must have.",
            "It must be on the menu and it's checking whether this is true because now so, because this is because of the crowdsourcing system we have when some other people answer something the other users.",
            "It's asking whether this is true and now itself figured out that if I order it, it's on the menu and then it's still asking me just in case it was wrong.",
            "If you would say no here with all this consistency.",
            "Within ontology with collapse know when it has enough of nodes, it decides OK, it's not it's wrong and then just delete the statement which which is telling this.",
            "It will.",
            "Enough notes.",
            "So we didn't define this set.",
            "We didn't, so this is part of the research or part of the thing.",
            "We have to figure out.",
            "So so now the first thing which will which will be is a threshold probably will, but later on probably will have to find some other metrics to expect there going to be several kind of decisions we have to make and then decide which of them to open up and which of them are not worth.",
            "Because there are many things to figure out.",
            "Now lights through the system.",
            "Jsi so there are also these consistencies and so.",
            "So here now I clicked on the this location part and it shows me the my location history and for example I don't know.",
            "Maybe it knows something about yourself, jsi you can click on this, link's as well, and then somehow navigate for this around it.",
            "Yeah, so basically this is what it knows right now about jsi and not much.",
            "The most important things.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And we have always a bit offensive to navigate to tell it about what we would like to talk, for example, or to ask more questions about you and things like that.",
            "So this is still very early prototype, so each day something is different in its.",
            "For.",
            "So this is not this is what it knows about me.",
            "And there are some fake facts because design designer I see designer, who is this who designed this, was playing and entering stupid facts about me so I didn't.",
            "Yeah, I don't know what he meant with that.",
            "And we have a bit of things, so right now it's a bit of empty because I just reset the knowledge base a week ago, but we have a bit of things here.",
            "Like for example if I would answer that.",
            "I like beer and somebody else.",
            "Somebody of my friends likes beer as well.",

            "So just lately started to add this kind of smart replies.",
            "Um?",

            "So I wanted to show you this but I don't know how many questions I will have to answer to before I will come to this question.",
            "So probably I should continue with the presentation and then maybe at the end.",
            "So I can show show that."

            "They took them more than 25 years to build it, and it's still not level.",
            "Everybody wanted to be that.",
