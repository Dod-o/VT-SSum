            "You know, a lot of very clear functionality for cleaning up these datasets and harvesting other data, but I'm wondering if they're used to using Excel.",
            "Is there any possibility that we could be instrumenting Excel to do this and then connecting that with the our scripts that they normally do to capture not just the problems, but also as you say, the process so that we actually have repeatability and we have the ability to go back and actually query to see what was done with this data?",
            "Yeah, that's that's an excellent question.",
            "And I so fat.",
            "Wonder about the same thing all the time and there's an effort in process to basically provide or Microsoft is willing to solve support plugins for Excel to do this kind of thing.",
            "Now I I particularly don't believe that you can solve fix something that's really not meant for the job.",
            "If you look under the hood in karma, there are sophisticated learning algorithms that learn about the data and do the cleaning.",

            "And also I see other tools that are cropping up like data Wrangler and Google refine that are really meant to work with data not to have lots of formulas in between the different cells.",
            "So maybe we are doing a tool that is what the scientists need, and I think it's still an open question whether we provide.",

            "So basically the otology that we used in this use case was an ontology that basically was developed.",
            "For this use case, but if you have your own ontology, for instance, in karma we can model the date according to any ontology of the users preference.",
            "So the idea is if you have your own ontology, we can model the data according to that ontology and then the metadata will be modeled according to that ontology.",
            "So yes, you could use any ontology you want.",
            "We are basically agnostic about the ontology.",
            "You know we used one and then all the RDF just looks according to that, but.",
            "Yeah, that's not built in.",
            "I'm wondering how resilient the system used to changes in the data format.",
            "I mean, if the data changes or does the user need to do again, teach the system in order to in order to create new metadata and so on?",
            "Or does the system have some way to to adapt itself to these changes?",
            "OK, yeah, that's a good question to currently.",
            "They met if the data formats change, you reload it to in the system and then the the the semantic typing algorithms that we have will recognize data that still looks in in the same format and if it's in a different format from what it was before, but the format that Karma has seen before, it will correctly model it.",
            "If it's a new format that Karma hasn't seen at all, then the user has to retrain it.",
            "And if the structure of the data changes enough, then our algorithms to map it to the ontology might not be able to do it automatically and the user will have to correct that too.",
            "So there's some resiliency, but we don't have specific smart about saying, well, it used to be like this.",
            "Now it's like this.",
            "Let me adapt everything.",
            "We we just solved.",
            "Leverage the pieces that you know the system has been trained on before.",
