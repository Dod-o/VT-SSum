            "So if there's anything that we've covered here we talked about here that was not clear.",
            "Or maybe I went too fast over.",
            "That's a great resource for you.",
            "The things that we talked about or I presented today were to get you started to give you a starting point for the data or creating data files that will be recognized or can be recognized by paraview.",
            "Also, because it is open source and is a very well used package, there is lots of information that's available outside of what I presented here.",
            "There are some sample data files if you want to play around with those.",
            "I provided a link with them with this so it will.",
            "You can see what the different types of data looks like.",
            "Remember I said the data that you have dictates the type of tool that you use and so this will give you some ideas.",
            "If you haven't worked with Paraview before.",
            "This will give you some ideas of the different types of data that has been successfully rendered and recognized by paraview.",
            "In terms of Python scripting, I added this as an additional piece from last year to just kind of give you a little taste of what you can do with Python And Paraview working together.",
            "There is some more information on the web that gives you more detailed information on Python scripting.",
            "Python is a great language to learn and to know.",
            "As you can see, it gives you lots of flexibility to do different things and to be able to.",
            "To integrate that with Paraview just makes it even more powerful for you in the different types of things that you can do.",
            "The part of her paraview that makes this possible in order to work with Python is something called the server manager.",
            "There's a lot more information on that as well.",
            "I provided you with the link so that you can take a look at that and check that out to see what are the different types of settings and things that you would need to do or can do that will help to facilitate your being able to render your your data through Python And with Paraview.",
            "So what I'd like for you to do is.",
            "I would like to do this, open the floor for any questions that you may have considering we had some technical difficulties with the slides, this will be a great opportunity for you to take a look at the slides.",
            "An work through some of those hands on examples.",
            "I want to make sure that you have a good grasp what you would need to do in order to get data into paraview.",
            "If you haven't had an opportunity to recreate that sample test file, this would be a great time to do that.",
            "So that we can see that you're able to actually get the data into VTK file format.",
            "That is the simplest file format that, aside from a text file or CCS CSV file that you can use.",
            "So this is an opportunity to do that.",
            "So if you will take a look at the slides, see if there's anything that is not clear, yes.",
            "Yeah, they should be on the wiki.",
            "The slides are on.",
            "Is everyone able to access the slides?",
            "Yes.",
            "OK, so yes, that's right.",
            "If you missed it, the slides have been corrected or the the issue that we were having before with the slides has been corrected.",
            "So you should be able to access all of them I.",
            "Created them in such a way that you should be able to follow through the slides to recreate all of the steps that we've gone through and so at this point, if you would work through those, or if you have questions about data about visit about visualization about paraview, this would be a great opportunity to to open the floor and talk about anything visualization.",
            "So this is this is your opportunity.",
            "Like I said, the purpose of the workshop.",
            "Just to give you a starting point as to what to do if you have data, what would be your starting point for actually choosing a an application to use?",
            "Actually visualize that data.",
            "So do you have any any questions?",
            "Yes.",
            "So I guess this is probably covered in one of the links that you showing, but is it possible to link to interact with the paraview session from an external Python shell instead of the one open by paraview itself?",
            "Yes, there are.",
            "But they don't.",
            "Let's go, let's see if this will open up.",
            "Yes, you're not limit.",
            "That's a good question.",
            "You're not limited to just the shell, you can.",
            "You can interact with her view.",
            "There are several different options.",
            "Um?",
            "The server manager allows you to connect either through the shell or through Python.",
            "If you look at if you open up Python, the paraview.",
            "Application on the desktop.",
            "You'll see something that says Python server, Python PV, those types of things.",
            "Those are different ways that you can connect outside of Paradiso.",
            "You don't necessarily have to be in paraview, but you will have to set something in your path to tell it where paraview is, because it's going to be running from that engine and you should be able to run it through there.",
            "So this was an easy way to do that.",
            "To give you kind of a hands-on field, an example.",
            "Of how to to actually?",
            "Type in the the Python code and get some results almost like instant gratification in a sense.",
            "But you can do it outside of that as well.",
            "That's a good question, thank you.",
            "Any other questions?",
            "Do you have any other software packages for unstructured data data that doesn't have a physical topological mapping?",
            "So what type of data are you?",
            "Are you working with?",
            "So I do circuit simulations, but it's before it's for design verification, so it's before like a routing and placement step of how the circuit will actually be fabricated, so there's no placement data for my gates in my circuit.",
            "Interesting questions like there's graph isn't dot to that will have like a placement makeup that will do it for me.",
            "Is there any other tools that you know of?",
            "I don't know, but.",
            "Place that question on the wiki and so that way I'll have a list of the questions and I can find out for you and send you some information I don't know off hand, but if I once I go back through and see what questions are being asked and I think someone else asked the question as well.",
            "If you place the questions on the wiki if I don't have an answer for you, I can find someone that they will OK and I have a second question.",
            "Is there a way to create interactive visualizations or like videos or GIFs?",
            "Yeah, so we were just having that discussion.",
            "Well know from comparatio you can do animations.",
            "It will let you animate.",
            "So yes you can do and it will let you save the animations Now what format?",
            "I haven't done it myself, but what format we have to take a look.",
            "But that's one of the things that it can do.",
            "Will do animations for you now.",
            "I think it would be you should be able to save it in a certain different format that would allow you to make it available.",
            "How that works.",
            "I don't know what it is a feature of parenting that stuff that you can utilize.",
            "Thank you, it also does time series, so if you have time step today to an you want to run it so that you can see the time.",
            "Since you can say that output as well from paraview and that gives you just another another component of a feature.",
            "Apparently that you can use.",
            "Yes, I just have a quick question about like how can we get a really good quality EPS files for the publications out of paraview like?",
            "What would be the best efficient way to do that?",
            "When you save your data if you look at that?",
            "And you you can save your files with a higher resolution.",
            "You can set the properties when you when you save it to to give you better quality images from paraview that way.",
            "That, I think is the only way that I'm familiar with as to how to get those high resolution images or pictures and it will save the the rendering window.",
            "That's what you would when you do file save as you can tell it to either save the entire screen or you can save just that 3D Window view did that because one one time I just compared the quality between Matlab, Paraview and Gnuplot, and Paraview had worse quality of the EPS file that I inserted.",
            "To my paper, when version apparently was 4.0, I guess.",
            "OK, an I just extracted the EPS file from Paraview.",
            "So have you tried it with a more current version of no?",
            "I haven't tried since then because I thought that paraview is just for monitoring the residuals, shaking the quality, not for publication purposes.",
            "Well, I think if that is an issue an is called to the attention of the the people who actually maintain it, then they would address it so that they may or may not know that this is something that's needed or wanted from the community.",
            "I would say have you checked the the mailing list, not the mailing list, but the group that you can, you can post an email or post a question or look at look at the.",
            "The knowledge base of different questions that have been posted.",
            "Pretty sure someone is probably already asked that question.",
            "I would say take a look and see what's been posted before.",
            "If it hasn't been resolved or addressed then send me an email and I can.",
            "I know someone that works at Kitware that I can can check and see, thanks.",
            "The Right flags that can modify to do exactly what you want, but this is yes, you can do exactly what you want.",
            "It just go to file save as and you will see at least a formance.",
            "So EPS if if it's one of the formats then this will be the solution.",
            "If it's not there, I can remember safety.",
            "PS If it's not there then you can save a PNG image and just select the resolution.",
            "The properties 2010 thousand whatever you want.",
            "It will be an extremely high resolution figure and will do exactly what you want.",
            "Does Paraview, or do any other packages that you're aware of, support live visualization of a currently running simulation?",
            "Can you repeat that live visualization of while I'm running simulation, the simulation might take hours or days to run.",
            "Can Paraview or any other package that you're aware of show me alive visualization that's updated as my simulation dumps its data to a file?",
            "In real you mean like in real time, yes, real time.",
            "The only code that I know of.",
            "Where I used to work, we wrote the code itself to do it.",
            "I don't know of any packages available that would allow you to do it, that's something.",
            "I think we fall under the heading of in situ visualization, which is a research challenge and visualization to be able to create visualizations on the fly or as the data is being generated.",
            "I'm not aware.",
            "Are you aware of any packages?",
            "You can connect from from well so you in your code you have to instrument commands to output the type of graphics.",
            "The well that you want to save and then from from a private client you can actually connect to the remote visualization.",
            "So Google Preview in Civilization, yes.",
            "Any other comments or questions?",
            "So have for those of you who had trouble with the slides, are you able to work back through the examples that were provided?",
            "You have any questions about those?",
            "Yes.",
            "I do have one embarrassing question.",
            "I'm sure it's a simple thing, but it's something I ran into and then my battery died before I could figure it out.",
            "OK, after I rendered the Conan let in this last.",
            "Exercise I was for whatever reason I was unable to rotate the cone.",
            "I was only able to pan around.",
            "Is that something that?",
            "Is easily explained.",
            "You should be able to rotate it.",
            "I mean I don't know why you are unable to pan.",
            "Sorry.",
            "There's a little button that says duty, or is this 3D and you can toggle that.",
            "It's probably something pending pending.",
            "OK, that's probably almost thank you, because when I create when I walk through work through the example itself, I guess by default mine was already.",
            "It was already checked and so I was able to rotate it and not just pan, so that's probably what it was.",
            "So there's lots of more information.",
            "These are just some of the things some of the sites links that I've.",
            "Identified to kind of give you again.",
            "Like I said the starting point.",
            "Give you a starting .4.",
            "Visualizing your data visit is also another application they run off of the same backbone.",
            "There are other different types of tools out there, depending upon what your.",
            "What type of data that you're visualizing?",
            "So if I may ask you all what types of data are you working with?",
            "'cause I know you all are different, dealing with different types of data.",
            "Not everyone has the same type, So what type of data will you be working with?",
            "Or do you anticipate working with in your your research?",
            "OK.",
            "Anyone else?",
            "Most of my data is comes from, ultimately molecular dynamics trajectories.",
            "So I notice that the trajectory files, the time formats that I'm familiar with were not in the list that you showed earlier, but that may be because there's already a.",
            "Relatively well developed body of software for visualizing.",
            "Remember that's just a subset I couldn't fit all of the data types on there.",
            "That was a subset to give you an idea of the different types of files, so I wouldn't say that it's not on there.",
            "It just what may not have just been on that slide.",
            "So I encourage you to take a look and see there's a complete listing of the different types of file formats that Paraview recognizes.",
            "Your file format may be on there, just not on that slide.",
            "OK, and then there's a other formats that the other files that I typically visualize are.",
            "The outputs of my own post processing software, the software that analyzes the trajectories, but I would assume that it's probably not difficult to write the data out to a format that would be easy for paraview to.",
            "Interpret or you can create.",
            "You can write a reader for it.",
            "It is open source and so the code for writing different types of readers is out there, and so if it's if it's more time efficient for you to create a write a reader for it, then I recommend that you do that as opposed to trying to transform your data into a format that to one of these existing formats is that the code is there for you to use to see.",
            "And there are examples of how.",
            "Other readers have been created.",
            "Typically all of you will probably be working with data just like what you've described, where you're creating your own type of format, I would say take a look at how to create a reader for your data set and so that way you would know that pair of you if you get it to read it into paraview.",
            "You can also read it into to visit as well, 'cause BTK is is a recognized file format, so once you get it into that format then it should be any problem as to where you can take it beyond there.",
            "But I would recommend taking a look at how to create a rewriting a reader and it will be specifically for your type of data or data set that you are creating.",
            "OK, thank you.",
            "Any other questions, comments?",
            "Yes.",
            "Have you had success reading data directly out of HDF 5 files?",
            "So we have unstructured grids from astrophysics simulations and converting all of those into vtu files, then gets us from like 100 or few 100 gigabytes of data to a few terabytes of data, and it would be nice to be able to just read the data directly out of the H5 files.",
            "I have not worked with that type of data, so I can't speak to how.",
            "What that process would look like or be like, but it looks like my colleague here has.",
            "So there are many different ways to reach their five in Paraview preview does not understand they have natively, but depending on your simulation package.",
            "So for example answer which code are talking about?",
            "OK.",
            "So for your code I don't know, but there are ways to release their five into an interview.",
            "So one way is to wrap it is what it's called.",
            "I think XML format XML if I think about 100% sure.",
            "So basically it's another create another XML file which is description for what's inside your file is your file, so it's kind of redundant because you have the description meta data already inside a 5 plus you have how XML, but that will force a private rated properly.",
            "But there are also a bunch of simulation package Mr. Physics that save data.",
            "As each day five in a certain format, and probably can read that, for example, can read Enzo, it can read Flash, and those red can write out a 5.",
            "And yeah.",
            "There's some other ways, but I just don't remember right now.",
            "Any other questions?",
            "Comments.",
            "So going forward.",
            "What would you like to see is a part of this visualization workshop that would help you in your work.",
            "I take silence to mean everything was wonderful.",
            "OK.",
            "I thought the Python scripting was very helpful.",
            "We've had struggled with that trying to get Python scripts, maybe some more advanced parts there would be helpful, but that's something that our collaboration is.",
            "Tried dealing with and found difficult sometimes.",
            "OK, that's very good to know, thank you.",
            "It was one of the things that I debated about.",
            "I didn't it was not included last year, but I wanted to add something new to this presentation and given that Python allows you to do a lot of different things and the flexibility that it affords you, and I felt like that was a good addition to have.",
            "And so I agree perhaps more more advanced topics on scripting with paraview.",
            "You mentioned earlier that in your experience, Paraview has trouble with actually very very large datasets in comparison to something like visit.",
            "In your experience, actually.",
            "What are the limits on what pair of you can do?",
            "That so good question.",
            "There is actually some information on the web that tells you where parentvue times out it.",
            "Hold on, let's see if I can.",
            "Think when you get into.",
            "Like TB size data.",
            "Maybe even before then crap hold on.",
            "So I think that, um.",
            "10s of thousands of data points.",
            "Well, you can.",
            "You can visualize that.",
            "More so with visit because it's built to.",
            "Handle these large datasets of that time.",
            "That's where you get into needing those high performance resolution or high performance resources.",
            "So if you have, let's say 500,000 points or 500,000 data points that you want to visualize or.",
            "A data set that's large along those lines.",
            "Really huge and along the lines of big data.",
            "Paraview, I think will suffice with visit will allow you to do more, so a parallel.",
            "OK, sorry.",
            "So yeah, so I did have a slide.",
            "I can't find it here, but.",
            "Visit was built specifically for.",
            "Visualizing large datasets using high performance resources.",
            "Parallel rendering things of that nature.",
            "OK.",
            "Thank you so I can certainly add to that.",
            "There is a misconception that preview doesn't scale as well as visits.",
            "So in everything I've seen so far paraview skills as well as visit so you can easily go up to 10, ten 10s of thousands.",
            "Of course for visualization and I still have to say problem where preview breaks, so 500,000 points is not.",
            "I mean it's nothing you can easily visualize.",
            "I don't know 8000 cube datasets on multicore workstation and if it doesn't fit in workstation consideration in cluster.",
            "So wasn't visit specifically developed for this preview preview was developed specifically for Terascale Terascale visualizations as well, so it's just it's marketing issue where visit folks.",
            "Specifically, they say that it is designed to scale to hundreds of thousands of process, so I have not seen a single problem we visit works with preview breaks.",
            "So I would love to see a problem where where people have trouble visualizing the preview.",
            "Because typically what I've seen is that people that have been told that visit.",
            "If you're if you're going to to visualize these hot, large datasets along the lines like big data, those types of things that visit would be the application to choose versus versus paraview.",
            "I wanted to ask Ken Paraview or visit or are there other tools?",
            "Can they be run headless like Windows UI whatsoever?",
            "Can it be run completely from the command line?",
            "I don't know.",
            "I've always run them through running the application, but with.",
            "With Python you should be able to implement or to run the engine.",
            "The libraries that are associated with each one of those within that, the code, and so then says yes if it's scripted.",
            "With Python you can run it completely in batch mode from the command line.",
            "Yes, so the way to do large visualization clusters is certainly not interactive.",
            "You want to debug it interactively on a small number of cores on your work station and then just.",
