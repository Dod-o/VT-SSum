            "That number goes down.",
            "OK, so one more word before I start my history of semantic web.",
            "Well, semantic web for my point of view.",
            "10 years ago when I started I would say was first wave when lots of academics and researchers.",
            "Word write heavily axiomatized ontologies using the latest approaches to ontology constructs.",

            "Stop having things that only work on their laptop in their particular version of Protege, and nobody else is exposed to and just put it out on the web.",
            "From my point of view, there's a third way by now that says, well, actually the quality when people just put out dumb data, anything they can somehow coerce into RDF is not strong enough, and if we need to build integrations of data for real applications, we need to be a little bit more cautious about how we do these things again.",
            "Along with that, there's kind of.",
            "A technology difference, so to start with in the first wave you would use your favorite ontology tools and a handful of instances in them.",
            "And maybe share them with your group.",
            "Later, when you're putting things online, there's all kinds of useful tools to do that, and I used to do tutorials, for instance on a language called Auto RML, which became a web standard for converting your relational database into RDF and there's work after that.",
            "On what do you do if you have systems that talk XML that took Jason what you do with CSV's?",
            "The web standards have kind of continued with that in terms of putting your data online.",
            "The technology that some of us were using alongside that are increasingly good triplestores, so increasingly good databases for RDF.",
            "But arguably in that space where you just throw together everything that you can find without a principled approach to.",
            "How it really goes together, how it unifies, what the what the model is that allows you to have a view of integrated things.",
            "Again, real world application caught some of the promise from that, but has much higher demands than I can stick DB pedia together with something that I've done.",
            "Application is really driving better modeling, better integration tools.",
            "I.",
            "And these days I hire mainly software engineers.",

            "My team will always have them, but in order to build applications.",

            "I think now things are maturing off that you can take software engineers and bring them into this technology.",
            "So now there's a difference between research pushing the boundaries forward and just building applications wasn't always the case.",
