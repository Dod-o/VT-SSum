            "So what's the topic of those two tweets?",
            "So when you do that, you will notice that it's often not that straightforward to semantically annotate them, because there is a lack of contextual information.",
            "So the solution in this example is for the first tweet.",
            "It would be about music, about the concert and for the second one it would be about fashion.",
            "So the question is, why do authors not provide more contextual information in order to make it easier to infer the topics of tweets?",
            "And the reason is, of course that there is.",
            "I mean, this restriction of lengths for tweets, but on the other hand we also know from communication research that authors or speakers tend to make their messages as informative as required, but do not provide more information than necessary.",
            "And this is interesting since it suggests that authors actually make assumptions about how much their audience knows already and based on assumptions they decide how much information they need to provide.",
            "So how much information is necessary so that their audience or there?",
            "Imagined audience can understand the message.",
            "So in this example, the first author for example might assume that his audience knows that she's a singer, and therefore for them it's obvious that it's about music and in the second example there also might assume that his audience is familiar with the work of Raphael Geonoma, who is a designer.",
            "And then again, it's very obvious that it's about fashion, so this example nicely shows that although it might not be obvious for everyone to infer what's the topic of a tweet, there is a certain group of users which we call the audience, or the inferred or imagined audience.",
            "Of some people for whom it is very easy to semantically annotate tweets and to know what's the topic of the tweet and to understand it.",

            "When I say well hashtags, I ground truth for semantic labels, but let me give some justification why we decided to use that as a ground truth.",
            "So first there was a paper in 2007 at the International Semantic Web Conference by David Land Yahoo and Peter Mika.",
            "Who were exploring to what extent hashtags have properties which are similar to the properties of your eyes, which are currently used as identifiers in the semantic web, and they found that around half of other hashtags could be aligned with freebase concepts and therefore actually identify semantic concepts.",
            "Of course only half of them, but still.",
            "I mean this is the beginning, so the second justification is what would be the alternative.",
            "Well, the alternative would be to ask some users to semantically annotate tweets.",
            "But as I showed you at the beginning, it's not always that obvious for external raters to decide what's the topic of the tweet.",
            "So we think that the authors are the people who know what they're treatise about.",
            "And if you ask some external people, then you might end up excluding all the interesting examples, because you will have a very low interrater agreement for the tweets where you can't find certain keywords in and you will have a high interrater agreement.",
            "If the topic of the Treaty is very obvious, and what people then usually do is excluding those for which they cannot find an agreement.",
            "And then, as I said, you end up having a biased and boring data set, so we wanted to avoid that and therefore we decided to stick with the noisy ground truth, which is in our case hashtags.",
            "So what we want to do in this message classification task is to compare the performance of the real audience with random audiences, and we want to figure out how well they can predict the hashtags of future tweets.",
            "Our assumption is that an audience which is better in guessing the hashtag of tweets is better and interpreting the meaning of the messages.",
            "So that's the general assumption of our evaluation and our null hypothesis is that if an audience does not possess significantly more knowledge than a random group of users.",

            "That's why we stick with them and we compare different approaches for estimating the background knowledge of the audience, different methods for selecting the audience, different methods for selecting the content, and different methods for representing the background knowledge.",

            "OK, yeah, now I get you.",
