            "So you know the classical concept of you have a spreadsheet and you do classification or clustering in real life that hardly ever appears.",

            "So that's really my my main thread in science in data mining signs that I'm excited about time and how things change and how we can exploit that in data mining.",
            "So then I see a specific sub area of temporal data mining that's time series data mining.",

            "A lot of the early work was an indexing alot of work on indexing and there have been tutorials and indexing.",
            "Also clustering time series similarity is needed to do clustering classification with different approaches.",

            "Also both and then you have sinchronicity only applies to multivariate data models because if only then you can say observation in one dimension and an observation in another dimension happen at the same time.",

            "This corresponds to.",

            "So now the important thing is I'm talking about time intervals.",
            "So something starting at time A and ending at time B, not about intervals in the value dimensions such as a bin for histogram or so.",
            "So you could have several streams of intervals coming in, and again you have order and then you have coincidence and synchronicity.",
            "So instead of concurrency I call this coincidence because.",
            "It kind of expresses that from one dimension an another dimension 2 intervals overlap, so they coincide.",
            "It's a little bit different than for time points that concurrency and also you could say sinchronicity that they exactly equals or almost equals.",
            "So then the operators become more complex.",
            "So in the previous slide for time points I was able just to list them right there.",
            "Here we have different languages of operators, for example ellens relations.",
            "I'll show you in detail for excess relations, unification based temporal grandma and time series knowledge representation.",
            "Um?",
            "So here all three temporal concept order concurrency sinchronicity coincidence you know they all somewhere in there in these languages, so we'll discuss that."

            "Samples overtime may be uniformly spaced, maybe not, but their own every time point appears only once and at times sequence is a multi set of time points, so you could have two elements in that sequence have the same time point sort of duplicate time points, but then usually it would require different data or different labels of these data elements.",

            "All these subsystems continually emit messages and they just come in.",
            "And then of course some might have the same time points.",

            "A similar one is the item set sequence, so now with every time point you might have a set of symbols, so this is the typical data model for transaction data user by something in an online shop and he comes back later and buys a few more items.",
            "So every every observation is a set of items, sometimes maybe 1, sometimes more, and then they're also typically not uniformly spread overtime.",
