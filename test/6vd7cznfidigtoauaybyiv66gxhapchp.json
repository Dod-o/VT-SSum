            "They skip the things that require a bit more time to think.",
            "And they don't care about correctness because there is no bonus for correctness.",
            "And so going and taking this as an indication for saying for anything that requires a minimum amount of thought, we need to go to the really expensive experts is maybe to Russia.",
            "Conclusion, Could you comment on that?",
            "OK, um yes, we definitely notice this issues, and I think that's something you notice in most microtask cases, but.",
            "I think people who do crowd work are fully aware of this and we put a bit of safeguards there.",
            "Now we could have designed the the we could have designed the platform in most of the way he talked about.",
            "For example, putting the bonus systems and putting in more safeguards for like spam checking and things like this.",
            "But a couple of things number one that wasn't the primary aim of this.",
            "It's definitely something we can look forward into, but.",
            "Simply, for example, bypassing the crowd and moving into experts won't scale, and I think you have to look at.",
            "Case of numbers when you're trying to do this, this, for example, our corpus initial couples were 6 billion, so it might be hard to get more experts to to annotate it rather than the crowd.",
            "And most times you you still eventually would need the crowd before you build.",
            "For example, better algorithms for your machine.",
            "It's also there's always the part of the crowd, and there's the issue of payment and ethics in crowdsourcing, and I think it's also a constant research.",
            "Constant area of thought and I don't think we've completely cracked that yet.",
            "So very important points and in your evaluation you show the F1 measure values, but I'm wondering, given your observations, I expect recall to be lower.",
            "The precision is that the case.",
            "Yes, the recall tended to be lower, but what we notice was that on the average, most of the most of the tweets had less than two entities, so for most cases so.",
            "And that was that was part of the things we talked about, and one of the reasons 'cause we had this discussion before about bonuses and I was one of the reasons why we decided not to use bonuses.",
            "So the recalls were lower, but they will.",
            "They weren't significantly lower.",
            "OK, so just just a comment about the payment.",
            "Then you pay per tweet, but then you show that people tend to skip tweets with many entities.",
            "Or would it be reasonable to paper entity instead?",
            "So we we didn't paper tweet we paid with the payment was for the whole task.",
            "So the task was to tag 10 tweets.",
            "Any 10 tweets.",
            "So the payment was for the whole task and still wouldn't make sense to set the payment of a task based on the complexity of the task, which can be measured by the number of entities to be.",
            "Hold on what you should know that probably don't need the crowd, but an estimation of the complexity of the task.",
            "Yet there I think that's one one of the research areas of crowdsourcing payment, optimal payment strategies and the many things you can experiment with targets per entity.",
            "But there each one has its caveats, and it's dangerous.",
            "People can just.",
            "You can also have like competitions, crowd agreements, on baselines, on number of entities in the streets.",
            "And there are many things you can play around with the payment so.",
            "Well, in this work you separate crowd workers and experts.",
            "And how do you know that the crowd workers are not experts in this kind of task?",
            "And who are these groups of people that are experts in annotating these kind of tweets?",
            "OK, so um, the people who would say will be experts I believe would probably people who would spend more time and efforts on it.",
            "So this is the end.",
            "Yes, because either 'cause they played better or better because they have certain incentives to do it better, probably 'cause it's their task, or it's their friends task.",
            "It's it's 'cause we are.",
            "All silly people like everybody is drawn out of the general set of people.",
            "So the people who would call crowd workers at those who are primarily incentivized by the payment to go to this task.",
            "Obviously there are different ways you can frame that.",
            "Ask you confirm the task as a game where you don't pay anybody and probably people have different incentives to do that.",
            "So I'll say people who will be experts here will just be people who would spend more time and thoughts.",
            "And probably come to the consensus or probably people who would say oh, let's use the nerd nerd ontology so we can have consistency on all our results.",
            "Any other question?",
            "OK, so then let's thank our speaker again."
