OK, and then the second thing is that other people also influence I, so if so I can access influence from multiple people from the network and if a lot of that influence comes from J then J should get a lot of influence points for influencing I.",
            "But if most of it comes from other people in the network then shouldn't they shouldn't get as much.",
            "Of course, this assumes that I know what this passivity score is for the notes and I don't, so I'm also going to."

        [
            "Tell you how we're going to define those.",
            "So in defining the specific scores, I'm also going to have two assumptions.",
            "The first one is that OK, so here I have the reverse.",
            "I have that I tried to influence Jay, but Jay is rejecting that influence for my.",
            "And so, how?",
            "What passivity scores should I give?",
            "Jay is going to depend on well, how influential is I?",
            "If I is very influential, Angie is still the rejects influence.",
            "Then he should should get a lot of passivity.",
            "On the other hand, if I is never influential in James rejecting him, then not so much.",

            "So if out of all their rejection that Jay does a lot of it comes from I is a lot of it is too high then J should get a lot of zoo it, even if it's to everybody else then not so much for rejecting I. OK, so those are the basic assumptions that we make when we when we decide what the what the influence and passivity scores are going to."

            "So that's the RJ and the influence score is going to be well, how much the somewhere all the people that he influences their passivity times, how much acceptance they do to his input.",

            "And the answer is yes, it gives us something different.",

            "Of course, just that we have something that is different doesn't mean that we have something that's better.",
            "And so we would like to evaluate this in some way that can tell us whether this is actually better than other measures of influence and not just simply different."

        [
            "So to do that.",
            "We well first of all, this is a hard thing to do, because if we're talking about influence, there's no real ground truth for what influence should be, so it's hard to kind of define it.",
            "But what we do is we test it on something that we feel.",
            "Is important if somebody is going to be influential.",
            "We feel like this is going to be important and what it is is how much traffic through the URLs that these people post actually get.",
            "So if you're going to say that your influential, then when you post a URL, hopefully that URL will get some clicks.",
            "Otherwise, maybe we're not so influential.",
            "So to do that we use this.",
            "We took all the Bitly URLs that we had in our data and what Billy is a is a is a shortening service.",
            "Where you give it, you get badly along URL and then it gives you back another URL that's very short, but it links to the same page and this is very useful for Twitter of course, because like I said Twitter, you're bounded by 140 characters, so if you have a really long link and you can make it sure this is good 'cause it bites you space to write more stuff or use makes it fit.",
            "So no surprise we find like 3.2 million Bitly URLs in our data set, and for each one of the URLs what we do is we look at all the people who posted this URL and compute the average IP influence of these users.",
            "And then we want to see if this correlates well with the actual number of clicks of this URL got oh, by the way, the Bitly also keeps track of traffic, so that's how we can tell how much traffic this URLs get.",
            "And so, so at this point we're trying to see, well, is there going to be a good correlation or not an?",
            "And actually, we think at this point we weren't very hopeful that we're going to get good correlation because of many reasons.",
            "First of all, we didn't take into account the content of the URLs at all, so this is only about the posting users and it would be pretty sad if only knowing who posted this URL is going to determine how many clicks is going to get in the content of the URL has nothing to do with it.",
            "We don't believe that's the case, so that's.",
            "That doesn't give us very high hopes, and also everything that we measure for these influences.",
            "Twitter is about Twitter.",
            "And of course this URLs can get clicks from outside of Twitter, so that's another reason why it shouldn't be."
        ],
        [
            "Well correlated.",
            "And when we make the plot, in fact it's not well correlated, so we have on the X axis the average type influence of the posting users and the Y axis.",
            "The number of Bitly clicks.",
            "And this is not well correlated.",
            "However, if you take the X axis in split into small bins and for each bin we take all the URLs and find the 9999.9% tile of the traffic of this URL.",
            "So like the upper bound minus the outliers, we see that that number is well correlated with the IP and so this is as a correlation of .95 so.",
            "We cannot get the exact number, but we can get an upper bound.",
            "So for example, if a if a URL was posted by a lot of people who influence, then this is going to get at most 100 clicks, whereas if it's posted by someone who high influence is going to get up to 100,000 clicks, so pretty big difference."
        ],
        [
            "OK, so now we want to go back to the original question how how does this compare with other with other measures of influence?",
            "So first the number.",
            "If you look at the number of followers that same upper bound only had seven R square of .59, so this doesn't do as well as the as the IP influence.",
            "Next we use the number of times that the users were retweeted, so obviously retweeting is an important part of the algorithm.",
            "That's how you define this weights, and so you would think that if you just count the number of of times that a person was retweeted, this would be OK. Measure probably better than number of followers, but actually turns out that it's very poor as an R square of .2.",
            "Of course, this doesn't take into account any of the facility stuff that we talked about any of that, so that's probably the reason why.",
            "And finally, we do something that's a little bit smarter, so we take the average page rank of the posting users and this of course was much better than the previous two with R ^2 .4, but still not as good as the .5 for the IP influence.",
            "OK, so that's so that kind of shows that this type influence actually does tell us that something is different from other measures, but it's also better, and at least this sense."
        ],
        [
            "We skip that.",
            "So the other thing was, what about the?",
            "What about the most passive user?",
            "So we used the influence scores, but what about if we take the facility scores?",
            "So far we've only used to kind of get the influence scores, but we also have the passivity scores for all the users.",
            "If you look at the most passive users in the network, it turns out they are basically spammers, so these are the top 10 and they are suspended accounts and some bots this keyword generator.",
            "So these will retweet any.",
            "Any any post that contains a certain keyword.",
            "It does it automatically so that those are the ones with the most facility.",
            "So this is something we like to explore further.",
            "So can this be used for for spam detection?",
            "It seems like like.",
            "Like it can, but we haven't really done much more with it."
        ],
        [
            "So in conclusion, we show that perceiving social media is hard to start to work on, but it's necessary to overcome if you want to be influential.",
            "We saw this week correlation between influence and popularity, so popularity measured by the number of followers, there's no correlation between those between 2:00 and also the type influence can be a good predictor of the upper bound of the of the."

        [
            "Rural traffic and for further work we like to do content specific ranking so we can re run the algorithm using only users that post content about a certain topic.",
            "We can also do content ranking so.",
            "Can we use this to recommend content to users that comes from very influential users to begin with?",

            "Yes.",

            "Do you think they are the same?",

            "Yes yes thank you alright so yeah.",
            "So I think I think what you're saying makes sense in Twitter.",
            "Like you said, is different from when someone's trying to sell you something, because then you're going to pay money and you kind of need to believe that your money is not going to be wasted right?",

            "However, there are instances where it kind of does work like that.",
            "For example, if I see a message that says so and so died, or some news event, and I'm not sure about this person's credibility, then I'm going to think twice before I actually say this to my followers, because if it turns out to be wrong then then I'm going to lose credibility myself.",
            "So it does have some risk, but in some other cases.",
            "It doesn't really.",
            "It doesn't really matter.",

            "Is there a problem with using passive passivity in that you don't know how many tweets people are actually reading in their feet?",
            "People, it seems like a lot of people use Twitter.",
            "They dip in and read some tweets and then won't use it for a few hours, right?",

            "We don't really know how.",
            "We only know how many you could potentially have read, but we don't know how many you actually read and we don't have logs for when people logged on or anything like that, so there's really no, no, no good way of getting that accurately.",
            "So for this this is all based on.",
