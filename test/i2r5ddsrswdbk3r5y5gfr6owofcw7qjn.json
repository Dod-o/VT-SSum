            "So we also started to have discussions with designers to measure their willingness to implicate themselves in a in a work of more respect to the environment when they were designing new products, and so actually most of the designers told us that what they learned when they went to design schools was actually to do better with less.",
            "So it was kind of already in their genes to work on the environment and to work on.",

            "The approach talk a lot about this design and how to end the role of designers within the integration of C to see, so we thought that there might be something to do and the DM was it with this collective action was to inform the companies about the secrecy concept and to facilitate the implementation of the philosophy in the companies.",

            "And also that the product promotion with an end of life perspective was easier when it was sold from the beginning and the designers also had a very important reflection on materials and toxicity from the beginning trying to integrate all those different aspects without necessarily an engineering approach and which is very important for the designers.",
