            "Yeah, so so this is this is a clump of dark matter which you can tell, we guess anyway, because there's a big yellow Galaxy in the middle and that there generally tend, we think to be close to dark matter clumps, and you might be able to see her as sort of reddish Galaxy here, which has been stretched out and maybe a another Galaxy here, here, here.",

            "Yes.",
            "Yes, OK. OK, good question yeah.",

            "That's a very extreme case.",
            "I showed it because I just love that picture and it I think it's very beautiful, but it's actually very atypical, so only in you know .01% of the Sky would you see anything like that if not less.",

            "Correlation.",
            "Yes, yes, that's absolutely right.",

            "More than one Galaxy at a time, and for example, you're looking for pairs of galaxies which appear to be pointing on average in the same direction.",

            "Then we find that galaxies tend on average to be aligned with each other, and so that's exactly the signal that we're looking for in the end.",
            "So in fact, to do this you need hundreds of thousands of galaxies to even detect this signal at all, we need typically a billion galaxies to do the dark energy measurements we want to do in the future.",
