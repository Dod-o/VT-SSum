            "Is there something like one science that's changed or other justice different communities bound to their disciplines and to their questions they ask?",

            "So it's perhaps not so much local, but this this connections.",

            "I mean, I think the question was is it rather this discipline specific or is that something that is?",

            "You know who else could use your data and for what purpose?",
            "So my observation is that for some discipline it's quite hard to imagine that they would be willing to share their data, where for other disciplines it's becoming rather common so.",
            "To give you some examples.",
            "On in, in in biochemistry, for example, it's rather general practice that you expected.",
            "For example, if you are working on on generating, generating knowledge about a certain protein or whatever sort of expected that they put their results.",
            "For example, in a public database, so that other people can access can access their results right and build upon.",
            "In in computer science, for example, there's also a culture of releasing, for example, your datasets publicly, and in fact, there has been a cultural change in the sense that I mean for all of us who are, for example, so ready or computer science conference.",
            "Many conferences now include in their revenue forms.",
            "A category would say something like.",

            "At least some useful data that could be reduced by others, so that for me is a deep cultural change, at least in certain disciplines.",
            "But while there are other disciplines where, for example, this code would change has not yet happened, so for example, to give an example, we we have some work, or we're trying to get some work with people from chemistry and the question we get back always from them as well.",
            "Why should we release?",
            "Our data, I mean our data, is our own intellectual property.",

            "So at least I can just only from from disciplines, and that's I am involved in.",
            "I typically communicate with.",
            "Come on, another that management in at least in computer science, one observes that a lot of scientific discussion.",
            "Well, let's say not realistic discussion, but there's a lot of research related relevant information that's shared using new technologies.",
            "So for example, in our community it's quite common that people are in Facebook and they use this for different purposes.",
            "Of course the network, but in many cases also to share interesting pointers, which of course is not the same as carrying out a scientific discussion which is impossible.",
            "Using something like Twitter or possibly Facebook, but at least it's a good way of of of spreading pointers that people can share and then they can then go to go and look them up and then the scientific discussion takes place.",
            "Maybe using other channels, but there's a constant exchange of information and pointers using these social media and Web 20 technology, so that's that's only a very personal.",

            "We know it's a very big Metro question somehow, but if you say different disciplines, different communities react differentials of 2.0 and they use it for different things, But perhaps we can say that all disciplines and all science have to react somehow.",
            "We cause it's so big Web 2.0 they have to do something with us, at least.",
            "Perhaps not now, but in future they have to react somehow and simply that they have to react.",
            "Is this perhaps a point we can say that influence that is changing them already, so that you have on this matter area to opposite side your idea?",
            "Perhaps something like a general change so it's not a specific change that change all the different disciplines in the same way, but all our influence all are changed.",
