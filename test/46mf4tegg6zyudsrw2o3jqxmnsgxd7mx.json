            "And so the time period of this study was from October 2018 November 2009.",

            "Then inflation of about sort of 40%.",

            "So the US average for income?",
            "For example, in the 2000 census was 21 point, $6000 per year for the Yahoo users.",
            "At least the estimates we got obtaining we obtained from using the ZIP codes was 22 point 9000, so it's slightly higher.",
            "In terms of, what's the fraction that lives below the poverty line overall for the US averages was 12.4% for the Yahoo users was 10.9%.",
            "Again using the estimates from the from the ZIP codes for the Bachelor degree, you see that for Yahoo users is slightly higher than for the US average.",
            "ETC for the affection of white people, it's slightly higher than 12 details on the paper if you're interested.",

            "So on average each user or 11.4% of the users queries is false and sort of this this topic about living Facebook, reckless YouTube and let's say 6.4% falls into the topic of adult content."

            "So this was the the the what.",

            "So how do people sort of search?",
            "And so one of the things we wanted to look at this like are they like, are they more likely to issue navigational queries?",
            "Or they're more like tissue informational queries?",
            "So distinguish between these two?",
            "We looked at the click entropy and sort of so the click entropy essentially looks like how diverse are the results clicked in response to a query.",
            "And so my focus query mean a query.",
            "With a click entropy of smaller than one.",
            "So if you look at these so here are some popular examples.",
            "Amazon, Craigslist, eBay, etc.",
            "All of these are navigational queries, so the majority of people who issued the query Facebook actually went well.",
            "Then click on the home page for Facebook.",
            "Or if the issue Yahoo Mail the query that they were going to like to click on the corresponding URL rather than searching for information about Yahoo Mail in general.",
            "So this is what we labeled as a focused query.",
            "Then there's a diverse query just to give you the contrast to these are queries with the click entropy of three or higher and you have queries such as American Idol or baby names.",
            "So people searching for baby names do not all click the same URL.",
            "They sort of try out different URLs, so there's not just one URL which everybody has in mind when you change this query."

        [
            "OK, so then with this data we try to obtain a user submits segmentation according to sort of what people search for.",

            "And so we had such a vector for for all of our just over 2 million users we considered.",

        [
            "So again, the cluster only used what they search for, not who they are or how they search, only the what they search.",

            "Sort of like who falls into a certain cluster or how people search within this cluster which were then induced by using an instructor topics.",
            "So to give you some of the examples of the classes that we found.",
            "So for example, one cluster which is the second one we label.",
            "This baby boomers because so users in this cluster are older than the overall users in terms of the what they search for, their more likely to switch from business and finance related information.",
            "So for how they search for their more likely to issue navigational queries and have sessions with this sort of single click.",
            "So which is again indication for navigational queries.",
            "Another cluster which is worth mentioning relabels liberal females.",
            "So these are people who are much more likely to search for shopping than a random user.",
            "There are mostly women, so 72% of the users in this cluster are are women and also in the last presidential election.",
            "These users were more likely to vote for.",
            "More than random users and their sessions are longer than for other users, which is probably an indication that they sort of compare different products.",
            "Another example, clusters are white Conservatives, so these are older men.",
            "The search lot for automobile and related information for business related information consumer electronics.",
            "The queries are less navigation and others.",
            "The last cluster I want to mention here.",
            "Re label challenged youth.",
            "So these are younger users from lower income regions and they search lot for music in the queries are again more navigational.",
            "So this is sort of like an overall picture without looked like the interplay between these things and more."
        ],
        [
            "And more details.",
            "So for example here, look at the interplay between the age of a user and what people search for.",
            "So here at the top you have the topic distribution for very young users, and then at the bottom you have the topic distribution of what people search for very old users.",
            "So to pick some and you see is that sort of sums.",
            "Each color corresponds to topic and you see that sort of certain topics gets bigger or smaller as people get older or another sort of more or less constant.",
            "So to give you some create examples.",
            "So for example, the topic education is most pronounced among young users, but then as people get older they are less likely to issue queries about education.",
            "The same holds for movies again where young people are most likely to search for movies and people.",
            "Also most likely search for music compared to all the users.",
            "Offer television related information, but there also topics.",
            "Oh yeah, the same holds for games.",
            "There are some topics where the opposite trend towards were all older.",
            "People are more likely to issue queries for certain topics, so this holds for a business and finance related queries.",
            "So the topic the lighter blue of these two is for business and then one on the rights for finance and in general.",
            "Or also gambling so older users are more likely to search for gambling related information.",
            "Um?",
            "And so another few examples.",
            "So if you look at so who's the?",
            "Which is the age group that's most likely to search for reproductive health information.",
            "So these are users in the age bracket between 24 and 32 years, which makes perfect sense if you think about, you know, sort of.",
            "What's the typical age where people worry about these things?",
            "Of whether the older users again are most likely to search for weather related information in terms of military related information, these are also fairly young users, but not extremely young users."

            "So this already sort of 1.",
            "This was some examples of the interplay between sort of like who uses web search and what they use it for.",
            "Some other examples that we found.",
            "Of course, there's the obvious gender differences where men are more likely to search for sports or adult content, whereas women are more likely to search for reproductive health, arts or families.",
            "Age difference was already went through this on the previous slide.",
            "Income differences so people from lower income regions are more likely to search for music, comics or military.",
            "There also some differences concerning race, so white people or people who live in predominantly white neighborhoods are more like to search for weather and outdoors home and gardening, agriculture and people in predominantly agent neighborhoods are more likely to search for programming and development related."
