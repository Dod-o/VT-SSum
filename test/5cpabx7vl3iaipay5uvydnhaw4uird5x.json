            "Thank you for a very insightful talk.",
            "I was actually curious because Professor Dominguez yesterday talked about the next generation of recommendation system was we like this 363-3360 view of the user and modeling all the interactions.",
            "I was wondering what do you think are some of the biggest impediments from an industry perspective to getting to that level?",
            "And how do you think those will be navigated in the future?",

            "On a product that I don't want, or if I buy some other thing or stuff like that and an from the vendor's point of view, it's hey, it was worth a try, right?",
            "But from your point of view, if I wind up getting attracted to deals and then when I workout all the details, only 10% of them workout for me or even plausable, then I'm going to completely give up on Groupon.",
            "So I think what I'd really like is something that takes the general statement of the deal right and then tells me what the value is for me.",
            "Given everything I know in the experience and 'cause I don't have time to read all the details and figure it out, yeah, that's a hard problem, right?",
            "I think I think we need to get more and more fine grained about deal features, right?",
            "What's the percentage of what's this?",
            "And that's the only way to model it.",
            "Yeah, but that's not going to help it.",
            "It's not just fine grained, features it.",
            "Yeah, you know it's am I being personalized for the value of the deal or am I being personalized for the product?",
            "It's not problem.",
            "Yeah, yeah, not really sure how to tackle it, but maybe there's like a more because there's not enough activity to get.",
            "That's one problem, right?",
            "The other is OK, exactly.",
