            "I'm explaining explaining most of the time.",
            "How you can work in or with ANSYS Workbench?",
            "So first of all, I'm interested in how much have you ever worked with work bench or yeah, ever had it open?",
            "So let me see some hands.",
            "Whoever tried Workbench so that I can get an idea.",
            "Yeah OK, thank you.",
            "So I will do a short introduction before we start with the software.",
            "I give a short introduction to end this workbench.",
            "OK."
        ],
        [
            "So let's see what's.",
            "What's happening in the in the next three to four hours, so I'm not planning to do a session later than 7:00 PM so it's in the in the program.",
            "So we are starting in part one with a prerequisite which is.",
            "NPI so how you handled multi multi processor communication so we have two possibilities in ends I will talk about this.",
            "And then there is another point, which is hyper threading.",
            "And then we talk about set up or how to set up each PC in NS environment.",
            "So basically we need remote solve Manager and I will go really quick through all these settings of this remote solve Manager so you can set up your system at home.",
            "So I'm not telling you how to set up a cluster.",
            "I'm telling you how to set up a PC that you have somewhere in the room which is really powerful.",
            "So if you want to set up a cluster, we have to talk to some other guys.",
            "OK um.",
            "Then where we started to to play around with workbenches here in in this chapter handling of large models.",
            "So there is just, so there are just some funerals about CD Imports or how we can import geometry that is already existing.",
            "Then we will examine the name selections.",
            "So how we can select different parts of the model really quick?",
            "Go onto filtering and then we have a new functionality in the latest version of lenses which is called object Generator, which enables us to copy different parts of the tree of the model so that we can be faster in setting up the analysis.",
            "So this is more or less all preprocessing work."

        [
            "One more thing about preprocessing, which is about meshing.",

            "Really really efficient mesh for if you.",
            "And then we have.",
            "We have we set up the model and the next step would be doing the analysis and there are some settings which are about the context and the analysis itself.",
            "So the different solvers that are available and the solver options you can choose.",
            "And then after that if the solution is done we of course we need to post process our results and there we have some.",
            "Different possibilities.",
            "Either we could check some results during the solution, which is a result tracker and.",
            "The other part is how we can evaluate different results after the analysis system, for example by using commands.",
            "So yeah, this is pretty much it.",

        [
            "Through this real quick."

            "Then you can play around.",
            "I guess this is the part where it is getting interested.",
            "Interesting for you.",
            "So I guess you had a lot today and so this could be something something interesting for you.",
            "So first of all we talk about MPI, so this is a message passing interface which we need if we're paralyzing.",
            "Some jobs?"
        ],
        [
            "So we have seen in answers we have IBM platform.",
            "Or it's also called HP?",
            "And on the other hand, we have Intel MPI, so these are the two possibilities in answers.",
            "So from our experience the IBM platform MPI is a little little bit more robust than the Intel MPI.",
            "And if both are able to solve the job, then it seems that Intel MPI is a little bit faster.",
            "So what we have here is that we have one solution that is really robust, but possibly takes more time in the analysis.",
            "But yeah, it's easier to to receive a result or to get a result.",
            "So this is the principle decissions decision, so we're at we at capturing.",
            "We're also doing the software support, and there are often.",
            "Or yeah, we also we often have take the question or customers ask us, yeah, But what you have?",

            "And this is the answer."
        ],
        [
            "OK. Then a few notes about hyper threading.",

            "So we have some some processors and we can have some some logical processors so we can split the processors virtually.",
            "By the time we're also we're all using cloud cores, so which is 4 CPUs?",
            "And from my point of view, there is actually no need to use Hyperthreading anymore, although it is, it is set or it is preinstalled.",
            "Let's say this way.",
            "So.",
            "What's the problem in ancestor?"

        [
            "If you're if you like to run a job on 8 course because of hyperthreading, you you're able to address 8 cores a different course.",
            "And this takes how many physical CPUs are there, and then there's no, it's not possible for you to run your top on it CPUs because you're having hyperthreading activated, so you just are able to use four cores and what's happening then is.",
            "Is he here let in German you see it's just 50% load on the CPU's.",
            "So you're not using all of the capability of your system.",
            "So, but what we're telling you is turn it off.",
            "Hyperthreading doesn't make sense if you're using answers.",
            "So this is over quite important, so hyper threading is not a good idea there."
        ],
        [
            "OK, so this is.",
            "These are the basics.",
            "So you see, you do not go too much into detail.",
            "I just want to.",
            "To to have you work on the on the problems, so let's see why RSM so RSM is a resolve.",
            "Remote solve manager.",
            "So we need this.",
            "Ask to to to to send our model to a different PC or it could be also the same PC.",
            "Tied to some powerful PC.",
            "So why are?",
            "Why should we use RSM or why are we using our same here?",
            "We have large models, we have a lot of users because RSM is using a queuing system or we have limited resources so.",
            "The hardware is is a few years old and it's not the fastest anymore, so probably it could be more efficient to have a big machine, costly machine that stands in a separate room with with air condition possibly, and then it's possible to have your users access or and it's possible that you're all of the users can access the single machine.",
            "We're the RSM.",

            "When we talk about RSM, we have.",
            "A few terms there, so we have a client so the client is used for a pre and post processing of the model.",
            "Then we have the job, which is the thing that has to be analyzed.",
            "Then we have the compute server.",
            "These are the machines over.",
            "All these jobs are the run.",

            "A number of servers, so there doesn't have to be necessarily one single server, so there could be a lot of servers.",

            "This is a list of it's not compute service.",
            "Yeah, probably it's also accomplished of compute service, but for basically it is also a list of jobs, just a cute."

        [
            "And the news.",
            "Then there is something else.",

            "So for example answers professional analysis and you can do with one single license.",
            "You can do a preprocessing, solving and post processing.",
            "But just one task at a time.",
            "If you ever split license, which means you split the license in pre post and in a solve Patch solve or solve Patch license then you're.",

            "So in the first case we have a single machine, single box machine and the client, the manager and the server is just one one PC or on computer.",
            "So probably you have your your only one that is doing some analysis.",
            "And then there is no need to have a spare powerful computer problem.",
            "Probably your computer is the powerful one, but it is not necessary to have it in a different room and you don't have several users working on this computer, so there is.",
            "There is just one there.",
            "Then you have this configuration, then we have the second configuration client and Manager service is running on the single machine and then we have to compute server in the background.",
            "This configuration is not preferable because if you let's like it is seen here, if you close the laptop then the manager service is done and then the job starts stops running.",
            "So this configuration is better, so we have the client which is laptop or different machine and then we have a server which acts as a manager and as a computer.",
            "So if you close laptop, take it with you home, it's no problem.",
            "The shop is is running and the other day if you turn on your laptop, you can retrieve the results and that's it.",
            "And then there is a different configuration which is we have client like this here and then Manager which is some kind of server and then we have a compute server.",
            "So this miniature server.",
            "But what are the system requirements so that the manager service just needs to have a really large disk?",
            "Because when the job is done then the results are retrieved there to the manager and the thoughts there on the disk on the hard disk.",
            "And if you plug in your laptop then you retrieve the results from the manager service.",

            "This window appears and we can say parts.",
            "There are main parts or whatever main parts that's it.",

            "For example, if you want to add or remove somebody's.",
            "Go there to the name selection and then we have here in the details view.",

            "You can edit the name selection.",
            "So what can we do with the selection right now?",
            "For example, we can.",
            "Use it to control the visibility of the bodies.",
            "So go there to view toolbars named selections.",

            "This part here in the toolbar.",
            "Should be visible there.",
            "We have a pull down and there is our name selection which is called main parts.",
            "So and.",
            "Then we can use this visibility menu to say hide bodies in groups or show only bodies in Group.",
            "So for example, if you only bought it in Group.",
            "And then I have a selection here.",
            "So in this case, the name selection.",
            "Little bit confused, so I say right mouse button click here in the in the graphics window and say show all buttons and I will redo.",
            "And more or as a name selection that is more meaningful.",
            "So for example.",
            "Selecting all the parts here.",
            "In Tennessee, create name selection and say this is bucket.",
            "Then, for example, if you just want to view the bucket, I can go there and say bucket show only bodies in Group.",
            "And then I do not get confused.",
            "By all the other parts here in this assembly so I can just view, take a view, or take a look on the bucket.",
            "So this is this is.",
            "One thing where we can use the name selections.",
            "This might be good for post processing.",
            "So let's see if there is now that the results are not there, but.",
            "Um?",
            "If we want to see the stress is just for the for the bucket, we have two possibilities.",
            "First of all, we have to insert some result item which can be done by going to solution and then this context sensitive toolbar changes and we can add.",
            "A result item we are interested in.",
            "For example, the stresses.",
            "Then we have a quite long list.",
            "Most.",
            "But in 90 or 95% interesting is what we're interested in is the form is equivalent stress, which is listed here first.",
            "So and then.",
            "If we go to the details window.",
            "First point is we have to scope the result.",
            "So for default it is all bodies, but we can scope it to somebody, for example to this left part here.",
            "Yeah, there is no result.",
            "Or no, this is.",
            "Yeah there is.",
            "Let's say there is no result and therefore we have the question mark here anyway, so we have here geometry selection for one body.",
            "So we can also do here like before hit the control button and.",
            "Select all the bodies and say apply.",
            "Then we have the results defined for.",
            "For the bucket just for the bucket.",
            "Or we can use the name selection we have defined before, so we just need to switch here to scoping method name selection and then we can go there to bucket.",
            "That's all we have to do.",
            "So once we have defined some name selections, we can multiple use or take take advantage of the name selections.",
            "So this is just one one example where it is useful.",
            "To use the name selection so you can try it out, go there to solution.",
            "At.",
            "For example, defamation.",
            "And then try to select an intellection with defined before.",
            "OK, so.",
            "We are using.",
            "Or let's say this way in this model we have reached bodies and one flexible body so.",
            "We can ask for.",
            "For the different stiffness behavior, if you go and then we can display the different stiffness behavior.",
            "If you go to geometry and then go to definition and go to display style, you could say.",
            "Stiffness behavior.",
            "And then we see that there is just one part that is flexibel, which is this arm here.",
            "The rest of the model is Richard.",
            "So this is a way if.",
            "If you do not have a clustering background, so you have a single box machine, you could start and switch chest one body flex to flexible and then you are able to.",
            "To evaluate are there results, stresses, strains and displacements for this body only?",
            "If you want to have the.",
            "Rest of the model to be analyzed as deformable too.",
            "But we have to do is we have to go there to to the to the individual body and then we can change here the stiffness behavior from rigid to flexible.",
            "So what we can do is.",
            "We can now take use of our bucket here of our selection.",
            "They say show only bodies in groups.",
            "So for example, we just want to switch the stiffness behavior for the bucket.",
            "There is 1 trick.",
            "You can say.",
            "Right mouse button go to.",
            "Hidden bodies.",
            "This.",
            "See.",
            "Go to.",
            "Pressed for this without contact.",
            "I want to go to.",
            "I probably have to select if you select the body you could say.",
            "Go to corresponding bodies in tree.",
            "And this would.",
            "Show the body here in the tree.",
            "We could go there and say, flexible, but this might be also quite time consuming.",
            "So what could we do instead?",
            "We could use the name selection, say show only bodies in Group, then do a right mouse button click and say select all.",
            "Then we have all the bodies selected.",
            "And if you now go to right.",
            "Hit the right mouse button.",
            "Say go to.",
            "Corresponding bodies in tree.",
            "We have all the bodies selected there and then we just need to say stiffness, behavior, flexible and switches the stiffness behavior for all these bodies at one time.",
            "So once again go there and say.",
            "Geometry visibility should only polishing group.",
            "Then we have them easy.",
            "Just the bodies we have defined in the Internet selection.",
            "Then do a right mouse button and say select all which selects all the bodies.",
            "And then go to right mouse button.",
            "Go to corresponding bodies in tree.",
            "And then all of the bodies are selected here and then say stiffness, behavior, flexible.",
            "And this is all you have to do to switch the stiffness behavior.",
            "So if you want to solve the model then.",
            "Can you go there to solve it?",
            "The pull down and there it should say LSF and if you hit this button I do not have it.",
            "Of course here on my laptop.",
            "Then you're running the analysis on the cluster.",
            "That's all you need to do.",
            "Connections.",
            "OK, so something different.",
            "So let's see Tennessee football bodies.",
            "And.",
            "Reset this playstyle to body color.",
            "And then we can.",
            "Either go to the South Button, then the measure would be generated automatically, or we can create the mesh before and and say OK, that looks nice.",
            "I will do the analysis or if you say well then it should be more dense.",
            "In some area you could apply some mesh settings there.",
            "I would not talk about this here in this hands-on training.",
            "But usually this is the way I'm doing it when I'm running some projects, so I'm I'm generating the mesh then.",
            "Having a, I'm looking at the preview or at then.",
            "I'm looking at the measure and then I'll say, OK, that looks nice.",
            "It's OK for me around the analysis.",
            "Could save some time if you're interested in the statistics, so in the.",
            "In the size of the problem, you could go to mesh and then have a look at the details window and then there is this point which says statistics and we now have 17,000 nodes which is quite small.",
            "Problem.",
            "So I could even run it here on my laptop.",
            "So what I need to do to have some different settings because I deactivated some some automatisms on your on your machines the automatisms are activated.",
            "At least this oil solvent result at one.",
            "At one PC, so it this works so.",
            "Doing it by hand now.",
            "So what's missing there is we have some individual board parts, but they do not know each other, so I have to define some Contacts.",
            "Do not worry, you do not have to do it for your own, so this is as I said should be covered by the automatism of the program.",
            "OK, so connection Group and then I say please look for all the Contacts in the name selection bucket.",
            "And then I can define some tolerance value.",
            "I say this is 0.",
            "And I just want to have face to face contact and then just go to create automatic connections and.",
            "Then I should see all the different.",
            "Contact which are colored in.",
            "In red and blue then I have it here, here, here.",
            "So I think they're all OK there.",
