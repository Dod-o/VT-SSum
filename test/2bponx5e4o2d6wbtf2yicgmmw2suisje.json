            "He has been a colleague and friend of mine for almost 25 years.",
            "Professor Lesser is the distinguished professor of computer science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, where he has been on the faculty since 1977.",
            "He received his BA mathematics from Cornell University in 1966 and his PhD in computer science at Stanford in 1973.",
            "He is known internationally for his Seminole work in the architecture and control of Blackboard Systems.",
            "And multi agent systems.",
            "He has been recognized as one of the world's leading researchers in this areas since their inception.",
            "He's a founding fellow of the Triple AI, an IEEE Fellow, and he's won numerous best or influential paper awards.",
            "His path to becoming an AI researcher is unusual.",
            "His PhD at Stanford was in parallel computer architectures.",
            "His thesis, supervised by Professor William Miller, developed a reconfigurable architecture that contained hardware support for representing and controlling the mapping of micro processes on two processors.",
            "However, he has told me that his thesis does have an in direct connection to AI, since the idea for his dissertation grew from a term project that he did in a computer architecture course taught by Professor John McCarthy.",
            "It was inevitable that Victor would do work in distributed AI, since his view of the world is not terribly centralized, ranging from DARPA to the Dalai Lama.",
            "Now if you are wondering what this means, you can ask Victor after his talk.",
            "What I can reveal here is that he got initiated into all four major sects of Tibetan Buddhism.",
            "To me, this sounds like an effort to reduce uncertainty through diversity.",
            "I think of it also is the first symptom of Victor's obsession with developing distributed protocols for reducing uncertainty in problem solving.",
            "His work in AI started immediately after completion of his PhD, though he did not know it at the time.",
            "When he took a postdoc position under the direction of Professor Raj Radiancy, and you very soon after arriving, he became a leading member of the team that was responsible for the architecture and development of the next generation Speech Understanding System, which became known as the hearsay 2 system.",
            "This system was based on a new problem solving architecture, the Blackboard model.",
            "It was with this work that he saw that he should become an AI researcher, since that was where the exciting control and architectural problems lay his work on the blackboard model, making contributions to understanding the role of controlling complex problem solving.",
            "It was one of the first to enunciate the principle that control should be considered as a first class problem solving activity and demonstrated in a real application that this extra computational.",
            "Overhead necessary for reasoning about control.",
            "Decisiones was indeed advantageous.",
            "It was also one of the first to introduce self awareness into system control.",
            "In this case, the system was able to recognize when problem solving was not progressing satisfactorily and decide how to change its search strategy and associated parameters to get prominent wealthy back on track.",
            "The blackboard was an important paradigm for AI problem solving through the mid 1990s.",
            "Almost immediately after joining the UMass Amherst faculty in 1977, Victor did his first work in Multi Agent System or what was then called distributed AI, together with Lee Arman of CMU, he constructed the distributed version of the hearsay to Speech Understanding System.",
            "This system can be considered the first multi agencies them application and the first were inconsistently among different agent use could be tolerated.",
            "Since then, his group at UMass, with the help of many colleagues, has been at the forefront of the development of techniques for the organization and control of multi agent systems, with a special emphasis on how to handle the issues arising from the existence of partial, uncertain and inaccurate information in each agent.",
            "His research resulted in numerous applications, including sensor networks for vehicle tracking and severe storm monitoring.",
            "Speech and sound understanding information gathering on the Internet.",
            "Peer to peer information retrieval.",
            "Intelligent user interfaces.",
            "Distribute task allocation and scheduling, and virtual agent enterprises.",
            "While it seems you Victor conceived of the plan to take over the world same, you will do that to you.",
            "Victor wanted this to do this in a distributed way through an army of graduate students.",
            "His plan worked and we see the results today.",
            "The field of multi agencies them now numbers approximately 5000.",
            "Researchers distributed around the globe.",
            "Victor has supervised 33 PHD's and number of whom now are key researchers in the field.",
            "For example, at Durfee to Amazon home Keith Decker, some other Victor students.",
            "For example, Tom Wagner influenced the field significantly through conceiving innovative multi million programs for government sponsored research.",
            "Victor students intern have produced their own students who in turn have become important researchers.",
            "If we trace down the linear edge, there are now nearly 60 pH days who can trace their roots to him to honor his contributions to the education of Multiagent researchers.",
            "The International Foundation of Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems in 2007 established the Victor Lesser Distinguished Dissertation Award.",
            "Victor was general chair of the first international conference.",
            "Multiagent systems in 1995 and founding president of the International Foundation of Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems in 1998.",
            "Victor's pioneering role in founding the field of multi Agent Systems shows his great Intrapreneurial Spirit and investment acumen.",
            "At first indication of this was when Victor, while a graduate student at Stanford, invested in 40 cases of the best California red wine before it became an investment category with mutual funds.",
            "Now you wonder how I graduate student could afford to do this.",
            "Here is the story his mother gave him a graduating gift of a couple of $1000 and the money was entirely spent on buying the wine.",
            "You need to ask Victor about his mother's reaction when she found out her gift was spent.",
            "Well, to top it off, when CMU gave him a relocation allowance for his post Doc, it was used to airfreight his only possession there.",
            "40 cases of wine.",
            "The wine investment was a good omen for a career that is both effervescent and matured like a great wine.",
            "In summary, Professor Lesser has conducted almost four decades of groundbreaking research in multi agent systems.",
            "His research contributions, combined with his superb leadership and mentoring skills, has been responsible in large part for crystallising multiagent systems as a distinct and important subfield of AI.",
            "He's rightfully called the father of the multi Agent Systems field.",
