            "Usually our colleagues graduate in linguistics and languages, but sometimes they have a different degree, which is a huge asset then because if you graduate in law or economics, this becomes really an asset, and it's been very handy in our daily work you should also have some training as a conference interrupted.",

            "And as far as our workload, workflow workflow workflows are concerned, there are basically two that run in parallel.",
            "There is one that's meeting specific at Hawk and there is a general systematic workflow that runs in parallel in in the background.",
            "So meeting specific workflow starts with an assignment you get assigned to a meeting and this usually happens from anything from 2 weeks before 215 minutes before.",
            "And for each meeting there is some documentation hopefully provided.",
            "So you go through all these documents that are provided.",

            "The next step would be to expand your domain specific knowledge on an ad hoc basis.",
            "So let's say you assign to a meeting where shale gas will be discussed.",
            "So you read a scientific article on fracking to prepare for that meeting, and in parallel you can do that on a systematic basis as well.",

            "Now, moving onto specific terminology while you go through the meeting in through the meeting documents and you extract some specific terminology associated with that particular meeting and hear technological solutions can also be of help because up to up to now we do it sort of manually.",
            "Specific terminology is also the terminology that we harvest in the meeting, which is quite interesting because there are we are on the frontline.",
            "There are new terms that appear in the meeting that they are used for the first time by the speakers, by the by, the members, by the participants of the meeting.",

            "Work where we prepare system systematic glossary's on different subjects.",
            "Sometimes what we do, what I encourage my colleagues, particularly in my unit, we do some brainstorming on the spot so we come into the booth like 1015 minutes before the meeting starts and an we have a little discussion what people found and what terminology that they identified as potentially difficult or problematic.",
            "And you know, we ask these questions.",

            "Now.",

            "This is a major source of difficulty for us, but there's another phenomenon as well.",
            "There are some people who do not show up for meetings and they give their speech to a colleague and then this person says, Oh my colleague has given me, could make it today and has given me her speech.",
            "It is in French, which I don't know really well, but I will read it to you anyway and this is what happens, Ann.",
            "This is even more difficult for us.",
            "Another another thing this I don't think comes as a surprise is speakers and their accents, and this is particularly with regard to non native accents and especially English.",
            "Then but sometimes there's a lot of confusion and hear the knowledge of the house, the systematic knowledge of the house come in handy because, for example, when you have names, remember sometime ago we had three Members in the Parliament who were called Busk, Buzek and Bouska.",
            "And if someone mispronounced these names, you didn't know what person which person that speaker meant.",
            "But if you were in the Agriculture Committee, you knew that it was busk.",

            "So that's how we go about solving these problems.",
            "Another problem is and it's a bit perverse, is information overload because we still few years back we still complained that there were not enough documents provided for the meetings.",
            "Now quite a few documents are provided for our meetings, but sometimes there are so many of them.",
            "Plus there are often last minute changes in assignments that sometimes there's no time to read them properly.",
            "And again, here technologies would come come in handy.",
            "I'm talking I'm thinking about summer summarizing automatic summarization about terminology extraction about named entity extraction, stuff like that.",
            "Technical meetings, yeah we do.",
            "With highly technical meetings, we have public hearings at a very scientific University level that's really, really difficult.",
            "Another problem sometimes, because in these big meeting rooms the booths are located on 2 levels and the ones on the upper level have limited visibility.",
            "We have screens in the boots, but that's not really the real thing so access to non verbal information is very important for interpreters because you know by by the place where a person is sitting sitting, you know.",
            "That they are left wing or right wing and you know you know that that you are hearing right?",
            "What they're saying?",
            "This kind of.",
            "Stuff.",
            "Now, obvious mistakes.",

            "What do you do with obvious mistakes?",
            "Well, we try not to correct them.",
            "We tend to say something so says the speaker and then we will get the blame anyway because that's the easiest way to do.",
            "The Parliament is a highly complex and political environment, which means that we have to deal with complexity of legislative procedures, meaning that we do not only interpret content but we also have to know the procedure so so so as to get it right.",
            "Polititians uses very specific type of discus.",
            "Basically what I as I said they don't mean what they say and then they don't say what they mean.",
            "And then again when there's a problem someone will say Oh no, I didn't mean that.",
            "And then they will blame it on the interpreter again.",
            "Another thing that's very particular to the European Parliament is lack of stable and predictable coalitions, because if you have your national parliaments and there is a coalition, it is stable for a period of time in Parliament in the European Parliament.",
            "The Coalition, the Coalition's, are built around an issue, so sometimes the green ones will side with Christian Democrats.",

            "So far.",
            "Fatigue in meetings and long term fatigue when you have when you do 4 sessions, 8 sessions of 3 1/2 hour meetings week, this is quite a lot with this degree of density and complexity.",
