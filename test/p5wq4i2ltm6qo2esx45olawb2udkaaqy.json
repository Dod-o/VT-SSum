            "We work with local communities and we worked with scientists and we brought them all together to address climate change.",
            "Why?",
            "Because like somebody mentioned, it's important that these traditional knowledge that has been harnessed, but it's important for the local communities to understand what is climate change?",
            "What does it mean and how will it affect us.",
            "Even more important, we found.",
            "Is that it's important for scientists to understand if we're going to communicate about what climate science is, we need to understand the language of the local communities.",
            "They need to understand what we're saying.",
            "Government officials, the other one to make the policies.",

            "So this was what this project was about.",
            "And like I mentioned, it was a pilot.",
            "Project to try and see if it was possible to bring together these different people into one room.",
            "Of course there were challenges the scientists and researchers who did this work will tell you that it was difficult to go to the local communities and ask them about their own traditional knowledge.",
            "Why?",
            "Because local communities are used to people coming and getting information from them without giving something back.",
            "This was a challenge, but as a result of this project we also found out that in all the project sites and wherever we went this project was done.",
            "The local communities were able to understand what is climate change.",
            "What is climate change science and how?",
            "Because it was communicated in a way that they can best understand.",

            "They used radio.",
            "They use different means to communicate to the local communities.",

            "I have previously previously presented these centers of excellence, provided the Technical Support to these countries.",
            "So again, you were investing in sustainable learning.",
            "So the technical scientists were also able to find and learn different ways of communicating climate science in ways that also their local communities can understand.",
            "And we're also able to learn back from their local communities an harness.",
            "A lot of knowledge in African.",
            "Asia is sometimes a lack of information and data about what, what, what climate science is, or what's been happening.",
            "But when you speak to local communities, they have been harnessing this information in their different ways.",
            "So instead of it being scattered all over the place, you also bring it together.",
            "This is something that's been a good outcome.",
            "And then, like I mentioned, it's proof that supporting centers of excellence is an investment in sustainable learning.",
            "I'd also like to point out that one of the things that came out of this project because we have.",
            "Asia and Africa working together was also a lot of learning and sharing going on we had Bangladesh is a country that was participating in this project an in Bangladesh.",

            "A simple adaptation method that they do is that they have ducks because ducks can easily float on on, you know, and flooded ground.",
