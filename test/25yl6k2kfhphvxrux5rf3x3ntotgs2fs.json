            "Start using these seeds.",

            "Through like clinical studies or the salesman trying to sell them the new drug.",
            "But they wouldn't prescribe until their peers.",
            "I know from the same hospital and so on would tell them that this drug actually works, so again, it was like the social power of the peers that made.",

        [
            "Is like a social process and also there are many other studies of diffusion that can go in many interesting ways.",
            "So here are two that are more interesting.",
            "1 one is that they were studying that obesity, which is basically like if somebody is overweight that that is sort of viral or diffuses through the network and they found some elements that if we have overweight friends then your probability of yourself being overweight like significantly increases.",
            "And another thing that.",
            "You sort can.",
            "Also.",
            "One can think of other pressure of peers on a person.",
            "Is this experiment from this from the 60s, where a group of final 10 people they were put into the room and the and every person had to say which line is the closest way and what happened was that the first line of them they were like paid paid or there they were set up in the last one was the genuine experiment and what actually happened is that the 1st the 1st nine people would say that C is the closest in length.",
            "Do A and then the last person would say the same, which is again like a peer pressure sort of.",
            "Yeah, sorry.",
            "Is your chances of becoming.",
            "I think they were doing it as becoming because they were studying over a longer period of time, but.",
            "OK."
        ],
        [
            "So so these are like the flavor of the studies that are going on.",
            "And now I want to give you just a bit of a flavor.",
            "So for example a very basic question for modeling this phenomena is what's the probability of of adopting a new behavior.",
            "I know as more of your friends.",
            "Adopt these behaviors.",
            "So basically, how does the influence propagate on you?",
            "And there are there are few hypothesis that we could we could make, right?",
            "Or at least the two most evident ones are.",
            "First one would be like a diminishing returns type of curve, right?",
            "So if an X axis I plot the number of friends I know who already own an iPod and on Y axis is the probability that I go and buy an iPod or something right?",
            "And the idea would be the more friends, more friends only, the more likely I am to go and buy it.",
            "But as the number of them increases.",
            "Sort of, the probability flattens out right?",
            "So this would be for example 11 hypothesis.",
            "The other hypothesis would be would be the critical mass or some kind of S curve behavior where you would say I don't really care when only a few people I know own and I iPhone or iPod, but once I know some critical mass of them owns owns the thing, I will go and I will also need or I will go about their behavior or something.",
            "OK, so these are these are two.",
            "Yeah.",
            "What we would like is.",
            "What is the thing in the network which produces one on the other?",
            "Um?",
            "I know if I have a good answer to this, but we were only the only recently we were able to start measuring this.",
            "So until I know two years ago.",
            "The sample size for which you can produce you need.",
            "You need a big sample size to be able to produce this curve.",
            "I know with small error Marks and only recently we were able to start doing that so and there are a lot of questions that I will I will touch on them later that there's a lot more behind behind it, but this is this is like a very basic question, right whatever if you want to have a model of how the how something spreads over the network, you should be able to say how likely am I to become.",
            "I know to adopt some behavior or something.",
            "As more and more of my friends adopt the behavior."
        ],
        [
            "And, um.",
            "Behavior is independent of the domain, so or the model should offer.",
            "OK, how far can you go in signing these models independent of domain which are modeling?",
            "So this is the well something which I never really understand.",
            "So is it possible to really to deal just with the topology of the network and spends all these effects straight from the topology and evolution and so on?",
            "Or you need to have some complex domain model as well, which would explain this difference.",
            "So I think this is a general philosophical question and there is always this discrepancy between machine learning models where I know all we care about is precision or recall or whatever you like, right?",
            "And there are these physics style models where you want to know some large scale property to be modeled by this model, and I think that's the question.",
            "The same question you are asking, right?",
            "I can always, I know, throw an SVM into it and say this is my precision, but.",
            "Is SCM the model from like explaining the process VM is not the model even though it will have unknown hundreds of parameters and sure it will work well.",
            "So I think here is here is the same right?",
            "You can what I mean by models here is something that would maybe that you would be able to generalize across domains, But then if you really don't want to go and do a solve a particular prediction tasks or a particular modeling task then sure sure you would go to more machine learning data mining type of models.",
            "Is that yeah?",
            "Um?",
            "So all I want to say here is that there are this, let's say, competing hypothesis and this would have a big impact on how do we think about processes spreading over the networks and how do we build models."

        [
            "And now I want to touch on some of these model issues, right?",
            "And there are two flavors or two types of questions that people ask when they think about diffusion.",

            "So basically the.",
            "Um?",
            "So this is what we're interested in whether the particular virus that has will take over the network or not, and there are two ways to describe viruses or two basic ways.",
            "One is the SAS model where, which is something like a flu, right?",
            "You are susceptible, you become infected or ineffective, and after a while you heal up.",
            "But as you heal up you can get infected again, right?",
            "So this would be this is 1 model and the other one.",
            "That model is something like is called SRSIR.",
            "Where you become susceptible, infected and you are recovered.",

            "In plagued outcome is fatal and you are removed from the network with chicken pox, you sort of become immune to the disease, and these are the two most basic models that people think about and then I will also talk about the diffusion models where I will touch on two most classical of them and what people do there.",
            "They are more interested in when does a particular person adopt the behavior and so on.",
            "South.",

        [
            "And let's go about virus propagation.",

            "There will be 2 parameters.",
