            "What is that?",
            "So what we need to do here we go in the symmetric case, we have an objective function, which is this one, so you know exactly what you are doing.",
            "In the isometric case, the very notion of a Nash equilibrium doesn't need to assume any symmetry in the in the.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Oh yeah, there are plenty of applications where you do have a symmetric.",

            "Take directed Hausdorff measures and what people usually does is to symmetrize the asymmetric payoff matrix or similarity metrics.",

            "There are metric violations which are not just an artifact of the automation process, but their intrinsic in the problem itself.",
            "This is typical in shape recognition in shape matching, so if you are in a symmetric matrix, I mean I would not.",
            "Yes, I will not use the symmetry because maybe you are losing information.",
            "So if a is close to B&B is far from a, should they be in the same cluster or not in the same class?",

            "The notion of a cluster is an equivalence relation, so the notion of Lester being in the same cluster, either symmetric relation.",
            "Yeah, but I mean.",
            "The problem is that what you do when you have actually what people in the psychology has done is that actually similarities and nonsymmetric relation.",
            "So what shall we do when we have a purely reworking in the classroom domain when we have a purely as a metric?",
            "Right tool for that.",
            "We can try and some definition of the clustering which allows us to incorporate this symmetry.",
            "I'm not sure I understand that this is a tricky tricky point actually, but yes.",
            "Special approach to translate?",
            "How can you make sure that the algorithm is not super imposing structure on the data which is not really in the data.",
            "I appreciate that you have data and they have some properties and you will only want to project out some of the properties because you care in post processing.",
            "But the real danger is the radio.",
            "When you use nonlinear methods in interpreting the data is that you face structure which was never there.",
            "But then looks very, but you're talking about algorithms.",
            "I mean I'm talking.",
            "So no matter how you get to your partitionings, they constitute some structure which should have a cause in the data.",
            "And how do you make sure that that you are not importing that structure?",
            "In some sense you want to have?",
            "Yeah, an entropy increasing principle like in nonlinear diffusion or something like that.",
            "Well, I mean, my point is the following.",
            "I mean for sure there are applications, there are problems were symmetry arises and it's not just because you know there is a measurement process which is making the affinity matrix symmetric.",
            "So my point was why don't we?",
            "I'm not sure how to how to answer your question in the sense that the answer is that I just don't know.",
            "But maybe the point is that do we or are we in the same ground when we use symmetric symmetric similarities?",
            "Are we?",
            "Are we sure that if you measure a symmetries you have measured it, you have to deal something somehow problem.",
            "Yeah, she said.",
            "Then equivalence relations might not what you are looking for.",
            "Or some other structure?",
            "That's fine, so we're saying that it makes no sense to do clustering when the relation is nonsymmetric, because this is because we figure in terms of.",
            "Yeah, well, I'm not sure I want to just to go back to the question.",
            "I'm not sure the question is what shall we do when we have purely non symmetric.",
            "So this is an idea, I'm not sure that we have to stick to the equivalence relation idea I mean.",
            "So I suppose you have problem.",
            "I give you a problem where the similarities are non symmetric.",
            "What shall we do?",
            "We say this is not clustering.",
            "Not sure types of tractors.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Publix tractive.",
            "Maybe in this data, but I don't have a pattern in the shape of clusters, but have patterns in different shapes and.",
            "Clusters are, by nature symmetric, right?",
            "And if there's no suitable number, different type of structure making I'm doing edge detection.",
            "Ranking structure, which I don't.",
            "But maybe this comes because I mean we were talking we are.",
            "We are thinking in terms of equivalence classes which gets back.",
            "I mean I'm not on whether this is a circular argument because you are thinking in terms of equivalent classes, because you think in terms of of.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It is, yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Take humans and a likes fever.",
            "Feed us not like 8 so you have this network, but nevertheless human somehow cluster so you cannot say just because the relations are symmetric.",
            "No, no don't try to cluster people.",
            "Yeah this is.",
            "Haha.",
            "I had a.",

            "OK. Also.",
            "Just as a given information.",
            "So these transitive, but we start with the symmetry which is not translating.",

            "What evidence do we have about the dominant Centaur?",
            "You mean noise in their financial metrics?",
            "OK, so I think we have experimental evidence.",
            "We only have experimental evidence, although that is quite robust on problems like image segmentation or even synthetic data.",
            "I do think that there is something more deeper in the sense that game theory allows us also to study the properties of Nash equilibrium in the presence of perturbations.",
            "We haven't done that.",
            "So from a theoretical standpoint.",
            "Answer is that we don't know.",

            "So we're going to be very simple example, if you just find a cluster by the neighbors or maybe like a beer or something like that, I think all these ball and then you got another structure.",
            "We have all needed tools, yeah?",
            "Yeah, what?",
            "Well, I'll be alright.",
            "3rd important was let's start with a definition with an abstract and non formal definition of a notion of classes which makes sense.",
