            "So that was viewed as a huge accomplishment.",
            "And when you actually look at the history over the whole course of the 1800s, there were refinements in creating these components.",

            "The other ways.",
            "For example, if you're showing ads that are more likely to convert so the conversion probability is a factor in the ad ranking, then if you have two fewer conversions you don't get shown and so you want to encourage.",
            "At least some of the conversions to be recorded an I think your point earlier about the not wanting to reveal your value in the ideal mechanism, you would simply reveal the value of a conversion and then you will run through the mechanism design problem that would design the mechanism to show exactly the right ads and to do exactly the right thing.",
            "But the difficulty is it's really a repeated game and the information that you reveal at this point could be used against you.",

            "You're pretty convinced that you can observe the actual conversion in terms of that process.",
            "If you can't observe the actual conversion or the conversion takes place offline, then it would be better off using a paper click or a paper impression based pricing in terms of the contract that could actually be supported so it comes down to the same kind of observe ability issues I was talking about.",
