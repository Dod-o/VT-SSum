            "It's a very, very long time line.",
            "It starts in 5th century BC and starts with wife auctions in Babylon, so it is so happened that the first example of a formal market mechanism of an auction that we are aware of is an auction of wives in the city of Babylon, the Great predecessor of all civilizations, and back in the days.",
            "The wives of Babylon were auctioned, directionless and interesting way.",
            "They were the property of the city, so to speak, every every young maiden was becoming a property of a city momentarily, and then they were auctioned off and the tower is.",
            "Sometimes.",
            "The bids could be positive or negative, so that those are the city would collect money by selling the attractive brides and then use it to subsidise.",
            "So the less attractive ones.",
            "Could find husbands, so at least that's how the story goes.",
            "And that was a long time ago.",
            "I'm pretty sure that this is not the first instance of the mankind using an auction mechanism to buy or sell something.",
            "But this is the first recorded instance, perhaps because it is so bizarre in many ways.",
            "So of course between 5th century BC in 20th century.",
            "A lot of options have been run all over the place in Holland and England and Rome and Greece I would imagine, but nothing terribly exciting happens.",
            "There are no major steps in advancing market design from the days of Babylon, and until the second half of 20th century when we see massive theoretical breakthrough on a very deep conceptual level, we see development of auction theory and mechanism design of.",
            "Matching theory and those are kind of beautiful theoretical results, very conceptual, so let me give you for those of you who are not familiar with an auction theory.",
            "But let me give you 1 classic example of an auction theory result.",
            "Let's say you're running an auction.",
            "You're selling a single object.",
            "Let's say you use a second price auction, meaning that the highest the winning bidder doesn't pay his bid.",
            "He pays the second highest bid versus user first price auction.",
            "The winning bidder actually pays his bid.",
            "What would you think?",
            "Which auction format would bring you higher revenues?",
            "While you would imagine that if US seller collect the highest bid versus the second highest bid, you would make more money while that happened to be not true.",
            "In fact, there's a beautiful result called revenue equivalence theorem that shows that on a wide set of circumstances their revenues are going to be in expectation exactly the same.",
            "So.",
            "Similarly, matching theory we see wonderful deferred acceptance algorithm by GAIL and Shapley, with whom you are probably familiar, probably almost all of you.",
            "So again, it shows how to sort of match two sides of the of the market, where each side have preferences for the other side.",
            "So this is always interesting and nice.",
            "But here's a kicker.",
            "So it turns out that weaker in his classic 1961 paper did not invent Vickery auction as we learn many many years later.",
            "Back in the 19th century.",
            "Second, price auctions were used to solve steps.",
            "Of course, we didn't know about it and pretty much nobody else did, so.",
            "This is kind of interesting.",
            "How the practical invents the theoretical and vice versa, because the practical design is messy and there are lots of errors in the process and people correct their errors when they see that their bad outcomes happen from the mechanisms that they design.",
            "So similarly it turns out that in the seminal 1962 paper, GAIL and Shapley did not invent deferred acceptance algorithm, although they thought they did.",
            "It turns out the markets themselves invented this algorithm.",
            "It turns out that American Medical Association was sort of running a centralized match, and they were tweaking rules of how people would be matched and things were kind of stable.",
            "The match wasn't working very well, they would change this, ruin that rule and adventure.",
            "They arrived to something that is mathematically isomorphic to what GAIL and Shapley invented.",
            "Of course, the markets couldn't prove theorems and also the markets have difficult time learning.",
            "From each other.",
            "Just because American Medical Association has a very big set of rules where they kind of got things right doesn't mean that someone else who wants to set up a different market elsewhere could easily learn from that experience.",
            "Is the theoretical understanding that is transferable and that is very important.",
            "And I think what makes things really powerful is the ability to combine simple theoretical models with their ability to deal with huge quantity of data that is only often spares where there's not enough information to make a full inference.",

            "When we look at this process, we realized that something that deferred acceptance algorithm perhaps describes fairly accurately what happens in the society similarly.",

            "AT&T, an Oracle, may not feel like he's being an object that's being auctioned to the highest bidder.",

            "I made an assumption that advertisers know the value per click.",
            "Well, if you go back to my first slide, the keyword was car insurance.",
            "Well, it is very reasonable to think that advertisers know exactly the value per click for keyword car insurance.",
            "It's a perfect case for this model because car insurance is a huge market.",
            "Lots of people search for car insurance, clicks hour on the order of magnitude of $10.",
            "There you can get a lot of clicky clicks per day if you bid high enough, you get lots of conversions.",
            "You know exactly the value of each conversion, so advertisers could build for car insurance for them.",
            "This assumption that I'm making holds, I think remarkably well.",
            "However, so far important marketplaces, this model may be a very good model.",
            "However, there are plenty of marketplaces for which, assuming that advertisers really know the value per click is a terrible assumption.",
            "Comedian keyword, the typical advertiser who's bidding for that keyword have never got my click.",
            "In fact, he certainly had never gotten a conversion for that one.",
            "That's not surprising.",
            "Advertisers often have keyword portfolios of 30 fifty 100,000 keywords.",
            "A portfolio of 1000 keywords is a very small keyboard portfolio, so in that portfolio there would be a few major keywords for which an advertiser spends most of his budget.",
            "But then most of the keywords.",
            "Maybe there is only 10 people a week.",
            "Why even searching for that stuff so clicks are few and far between, so there.",
            "Datamining comes becomes incredibly important.",
            "One could use all kinds of clever tricks to infer values when they spares data you don't have direct evidence you couldn't really measure exactly what the value is, but you can make a clever inference based on those other 29,000 keywords.",
            "What's your value of this keyword doing all kinds of feature matching and so on and so forth, so that's definitely very important direction.",
            "We're getting to the point where we're starting to mind that tail where there's a lot of value, but for both search engines.",
            "And advertisers to realize those values we need more data mining.",
            "We need better models and we need to know how to combine those models with market mechanisms.",
            "So another related question.",
            "For.",
            "Of.",
            "For many so so now they're related questions just to sort of emphasize how tricky things aren't, how difficult it is to use data mining.",
            "So let's ask a very basic question.",
            "Is that even true that the number of clicks at 100 eyes in the first position would get?",
            "Is independent is independent or how many ads we shall?",
            "May or may not be true.",
            "Let's I do a simple exercise so you know what I'll just see click through rate of in the order for the first position in the marketplace where there's a single advertiser an I'll look at clicks right in the first position of marketplaces where that 10 advertisers help.",
            "Compare that to.",
            "That seems like a reasonable thing to do, except that it's not what you will probably find.",
            "You'll probably find, at least in many market in many market segments.",
            "Is that one day is a single advertiser, single advertisement.",
            "The click through rate in the top position?",
            "Is much lower than when there's a dozen.",
            "But that's not becausw aging advertisement increases click through rate in the first position.",
            "That's been 'cause nobody wants to be it for things that have very low commercial interest.",
            "And that's why there's only one app.",
            "So even when you use.",
            "Machine learning and data mining technique one has to be very mindful of this indigeneity issue and very mindful of the fact that whenever you change something in the marketplace is not just that first order effect.",
            "The 2nd order effects advertisers change their behavior and that effect could be at least in the example I showed you order of magnitude greater than the 1st order effect.",
            "So thank you and again, it's my honor and a pleasure to talk to this distinguished audience.",
            "So we have a couple of minutes left for questions.",
            "Thank you for your talk to there's there's a concept in behavioral economics known as the Winners Curse, which is sort of like buyers remorse.",
            "The winter looks at what they get and they think, oh, it's not really worth that much.",
            "I've never seen that addressed in the Internet.",
            "Auction design is does that.",
            "Does that hold at all, or does that second price mechanism take care of?",
            "That's a good question so.",
            "First of all, the concept of winners curse actually fascinating concept because it is not only in behavioral economics.",
            "In fact, the concept of winners curse was invented at least 10 years before behavioral economics was invented.",
            "An in fact that serve comes out from the mechanism design, and in fact it's not behavioral concept.",
            "If you write throughout so obviously the fact that it exists influences our behavior, and that's why it's important for behavioral economics.",
            "We are on the same page with that.",
            "But the notion of winners curse the reason that there's a winner's curse.",
            "There's a completely rational reason.",
            "So, so, the classic example is the following.",
            "Let's say we are at an auction buying used cars.",
            "I want to buy a car to drive.",
            "You are a car mechanic, and you're buying a car to resell.",
            "There's one little problem.",
            "You know everything about cars.",
            "You can look at the car.",
            "You immediately know if it's a lemon or not, and.",
            "I I'm not very good at figuring out which cars are reliable and which aren't right.",
            "So you have special expertise and I don't.",
            "So when I outbid you, right?",
            "So my big happened to be higher than your bed.",
            "I'm a winner.",
            "I suffer from winners curse in the sense that the fact that I managed to outbid you is an awful news, because I was bidding against informed professional, and it turns out that my value for this car is higher than heels, as probably means that the car is a lemon.",
            "In other words, conditional if you write it in the language of conditional probability, it would says even though in expectation I think this car is worth 5000, conditional on me being able to purchase this car for 5000 in competition with all those other smart chaps who know something about the cars.",
            "The value of this car is less than 5000, right?",
            "So it's just an issue of conditional probability, and that's where Winner secures come from.",
            "So then I still didn't answer your question so.",
            "Then should we worry bout winners cars in the market for Internet advertising?",
            "So it turns out that winners curse is only a problem.",
            "It only exists in markets where they so called common value.",
            "So in other words, if I know exactly what my values as I look, they are all great experts here.",
            "I know what this car is worth to me and I don't care what you think.",
            "Right, so for example, I just know everything to know about this car and so do you, so there's no winners curse.",
            "That's what Myerson calls are sort of preference difference as opposed to quality difference.",
            "So is there only preference difference that's called private value?",
            "And then there's no business cards because conditional and me winning this car for $5000, the value of this character is still $5000.",
            "I know I will need to know there's no updating.",
            "So however, if there's a common value, there's some quality difference.",
            "Then there's a winner's curse, so I think your questions very.",
            "Very good question, because when you think about the market like car insurance, keyword for car insurance, there's not much winners curse.",
            "I don't think there's any winners curse because every advertiser who plays in this market is very sophisticated advertisers.",
            "He gets lots of clicks.",
            "You really knows what clicks are worth to him and he.",
            "Does not update based on him winning or losing because he has enough information.",
            "However, once you move into the tail, the winners curse issue becomes very powerful.",
            "Let's say I'm in the business of, you know, renting mobile toilets and so are you.",
            "I'm bidding for some keywords where I get 2 clicks a week and so do you.",
            "Do I really know how much those clicks are worth to me?",
            "Do I really could?",
            "I really estimate the probability of conversion based on this tiny number of clicks now, and it's likely that my conversion rate is correlated to your conversion rate and hence my values correlated with your value.",
            "So when you are in the head, there's no winners curse.",
            "I don't believe we should worry about it once you go to the tail, we should start worrying about winners occurs and we don't.",
            "Yep, but we should thank you.",
            "Pardon my ignorance, but is there a stock market equivalent for keywords you know in terms of historical prices, volumes, liquidity and so on?",
            "Can you repeat your question?",
            "Is there a stock market equivalent for keywords, meaning historical prices, historical volumes, liquidity time series?",
            "You know if you can look at it.",
            "Look at keywords in terms of the stock market, where each keyword is a stock symbol.",
            "Is there a sense of liquidity and can you look at all I see I see what you're saying.",
            "Yes, I see your question so, so the analogy between keywords and stocks is very, very imperfect.",
            "So the most important difference, I think, is that clicks are very much private value things.",
            "The very very logic stamp.",
            "So, for example, GEICO values clicks for car insurance and.",
            "You don't, on the other hand, stocks have a huge common value component in the sense that we really all buy them for for the dividends and what they what they will be worth a year from now.",
            "So there's a huge common value components component in stocks, so that's the most striking difference, because there are many other differences in the sense that you know you buy a stock to hold and to sell it to someone else, you buy a click that you do something with it at some input for your business.",
            "So keywords are much more.",
            "Like inputs in the production process that like financial security.",
            "So I think they are out of out of time, but I will be, you know, hanging, hanging around outside and I will be happy to take the remaining questions.",
            "Just one on one more.",
            "Thank you."
