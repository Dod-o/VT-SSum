            "So we have a joint project with the lab of Ornithology called Bird Cast and our goal is to understand and forecast bird migration.",

            "Well we have a variety of different data that are available.",
            "We have the ibird observations that I mentioned before.",

            "But it turns out they also pick up clouds of migrating birds and what just swept across the screen was sunset, an almost all bird migration happens at night and there there are on some nights, billions of birds airborne over the world an millions over the United States.",

            "These birds all take off and start flying.",

            "So this is this is really amazing data and gives us real time observations and then the third thing is that a lot of species give off very short night flight calls as there as they're migrating, and so we're trying to roll out another citizen science project where people will put microphones on their barns and houses and and will try to collect these flight call data, which we have shown we can do species identification from.",
            "So our goal is to do 24 to 48 hour forecast of the bird migration, which are bird.",
            "Bird watchers will love and so also will the Air Force and other pilots.",
            "But our biological question is, well, what are the factors driving bird migration?",
            "How do birds make their decisions about when to fly?",
            "Went to stay put?",
            "Are they sensitive to wind speed and direction?",
            "Most people think so that they wait for favorable winds.",
            "What about temperature and humidity?",
            "What about are they on an absolute Clock where if they get behind by a few days they try to catch up?",
            "Or are they willing to wait and sort of follow the food availability as as bugs Hatch in the spring so there are a lot of open questions here that the biologists would like answers to.",
            "To answer them, we need to reconstruct the actual flow of birds from one cell to another and so our goal is to fit a spatial hidden Markov model to the data where we're going to define a grid over the United States and that let's let NI at time T be the number of birds that are in cell I at time T. To say we're particular species and then we want to learn a probability transition matrix for each night.",
            "Well, you know what's the probability of birds will fly from Cellulitis LJ and make that conditioned on wind in the temperature in the time and so on.",
            "So it would be great if we could convince each bird to carry an iPhone and we could just track them and that's our dream data, because then it wouldn't be hidden.",
            "Markov model would be fully observed.",
            "We don't even need all the birds, maybe just a sample of 10,000 of them or something.",
            "But the data we have is essentially anonymized data.",
            "We have these aggregate counts and we saw 34 Robins over here one day and then 28 over here the next day.",
            "And the question is, are any of those the same bird or not?",
            "We don't know.",
            "And of course, the radar definitely just gives us anonymous data, but aggregated over all the species, so we can actually estimate fairly well birds per cubic kilometer from the radar.",
            "But we don't know what species they are.",
            "So my former postdoc Dan Sheldon, who just started at UMass Amherst, developed a formalism called collective graphical models that was published in a pair of papers at NIPS.",
            "I think in 2009, and then last year, and the modeling methodology where you first start by building on thinking about conceptually a model of 1 bird.",
            "So we imagine 1 bird is executing a Markov chain, in which time one there in cell X1 and time to their in cell X2, and so on.",
            "And then we're going to make a questionable assumption that all these birds are actually IID population of big M birds.",
            "So we're going to draw a plate around them and say these are all our guys, and so no flocking here.",
            "These birds are all going to make independent decisions on their own.",
            "And then from this we derive our observed aggregate observations.",
            "So for a moment, let's assume we could actually observe the number of birds in each cell will actually have obviously very noisy version of this.",
            "And so N1 would be a vector of the number of birds in each cell across the map on that time.",
            "And so then we can actually marginalized out the individuals and we are left with a chain structured model whose state variables are actually the sufficient statistics of the individual model.",
            "By and so N 1 two now is the how many birds on the night from day one to day two went from site to site J so if we can get a map estimate of these anti Jays or NTT plus ones then that gives us a fit of the individual model and so we can explain at the individual level with the birds are doing.",
            "So the beauty is we don't need to reconstruct the individual tracks of the individual birds in order to still fit a model at the individual level, and similar ideas probably would work for other forms of anonymized data.",
            "So last year we we had a paper where we started to deal with how would you do inference in this model?",
            "So of course there if we had to reason about the individual tracks of every bird, that would be horrible.",
            "And and by doing this we reduce the problem substantially.",
            "But we still have to reason over state vectors that are counts of birds in every cell.",
            "So we need to be able to do that somehow and we're taking Gibbs sampling approach with them.",
            "So we need to sample from these flows condition on the observations, and so Dan developed a fast Gibbs sampler that enforces conservation of birds in the sense that all the birds entering a cell have to leave the cell and the beauty of this Gibbs sampler is that it has a running time that's independent of the population size.",
            "Unlike, you know variable elimination, which we see here scales badly, so this is what our migration model that we have no results yet.",
            "But this is what it looks like.",
            "The top plate is is the bird migration model and then hanging off of it.",
            "We have various observation modalities, so we have the eBird data, the acoustic data, the radar data and then we want to put in of course the weather and habitat covariates, which will let us really test the scientific questions.",
            "OK, well the last thing I want to describe is our work on a little bit of work on policy optimization, and we're studying various different kinds of invasive species, and in particular we've been looking at 1:00, called tamarisk, which isn't a tree that comes from the Middle East, but is now traveling through the intermountain West for which for those of us who landed in Reno, that's kind of where the Intermountain West begins, and then it goes eastward from there towards Colorado and in these River systems.",
            "This tree is kind of spreading along the River network.",
            "And it outcompetes the native vegetation.",
            "And an reduces habitat for birds and various other things.",
            "So the question is, what is the best way to handle a spatially spreading Organism?",
            "And so we formulate this as a Markov decision process, in this case, over a tree structured River network where we have big E edges and each edge has some number of sites slots where a tree can grow an in each of those slots is either empty or it's occupied by a native tree, or by the tamarisk tree, which is T here.",
            "So the first thing to notice is that the state space is exponential.",
            "So if we have three possible states for each cell, then there's 3 to the power, EH?",
            "States in the entire MDP, and so even when E is 3 and H is 5, that's three to the 15th power, so it's a big table and then the management actions at each time step in each reach.",
            "We can do nothing.",
            "We can go and eradicate, try to kill the tamarisk, we can restore, which is poorly named, but it means planting native species in each of the open slots.",
            "Or we can try to eradicate and restore, kill the tamarisk and then plant natives everywhere so the action space, the simple action spaces.",
            "4 to the power E number of actions.",
            "So the dynamics of this model is is is based on some published models.",
            "In the first thing is that in each time period a tree can die a natural death with some probability, and then the trees reproduce and they create seeds or propagules as the technical term, and then these propagules disperse spatially.",
            "And this of course is our big challenge because that couples what's happening in every cell to what's happening in every other cell.",
            "Of course, they mostly go downstream, but but there's some low probability of going upstream.",
            "And then they compete to to occupy the new sites.",
            "Now it turns out that this is easily.",
            "You can easily write this down as a dynamic Bayes network, but unfortunately inferences intractable in the model and so we're reduced to sampling from it.",
            "And our objective here is we want to minimize the expected discounted costs of the of the invasion plus the management actions subject to some annual budget constraint.",
            "So we've been trying to work on a sort of pacol tymal algorithms that minimize the number of calls to the simulator, and this is an area of research that people have been.",
            "Pursuing for several years and we have a new algorithm we call GDV and for this we are using an explicit representation of the Markov decision problem and we maintain confidence intervals on all of the Q values of all of the states that we have discovered so far.",
            "Then we also can derive from those.",
            "Of course confidence intervals on the value of the start stage and what is this confidence over?",
            "Well, it's over.",
            "Basically over the transition probabilities that we're trying to discover by invoking the simulator.",
            "And then the final thing we do is we maintain an upper bound and this is sort of the novel idea on the discounted state occupancy probabilities.",
            "So if you think about the linear programming formulation of an MDP right, the primal variables are typically the value function.",
            "The dual variables are basically the probability of visiting each state under the ultimate policy, so we have a kind of loose upper bound on that, and using that upper bound we then we're going to try to calculate a sort of expected value of information.",
            "Greedy algorithm for sampling the state action pair.",
            "That would most help us reduce the gap between the upper and lower bound at the start state.",
            "So the heuristic we use is basically if we were to explore particular state, like SA2, that would lead to some local reduction in the confidence interval gap at that stage for that Q value, and then we're going to multiply that change which we call Delta.",
            "The change in Delta Q by mu upper and to figure out what its impact is on the the confidence interval to start state.",
            "And so we basically explored the state action pair that minimizes this.",
            "And of course we can wrap this into priority queues and so on.",
            "So here are some results on River Swim benchmark which is we took from the strong Littman paper.",
            "They had this beautiful paper where they developed a model based interval XX.",
            "Which maintains an upper confidence interval and sort of samples under a optimism under uncertainty heuristics and we can see what we're plotting here is as a function of the number of calls to the simulator.",
            "What are the confidence intervals, and are the blue lines are upper and lower interval over that white line, which is the optimal value and we can see that there were much more effectively reducing the the confidence interval.",
            "Both algorithms come with Pat guarantees, and so we've applied this to our tamarisk problem and compare it against some rule of thumb policies.",
            "There have been several papers published in the Natural Resource literature that say, well, this is a hard problem to optimize, but maybe it doesn't really matter.",
            "Maybe we can just use these heuristics, for instance, treating the most invaded edge in the rivers network first, or treat the leading edge of the expanding wavefront of the infection and so on.",
            "But what we found is.",
            "You know, it really does pay to optimize.",
            "Computer scientists aren't wasting our time and trying to come up with with good solutions to these problems.",
            "OK, so in summary then I've tried to describe these three areas where we're making some progress on some of these computational ecology questions.",
            "The with the species distribution modeling from imperfect observations where we're working on flexible latent variable models.",
            "And then we're trying to extend that to flexibel latent process models hidden Markov models using this collective graphical model formalism.",
            "And finally, we're working on trying to do policy optimization where the MDP is defined by a large and expensive simulator, and I haven't even talked about our fire simulator, which is very, very inefficient.",
            "So what is the distinctive characteristics of these applications?",
            "I mean, is this just another application area for machine learning?",
            "We know there are many, many others out there.",
            "I think some of the distinct things are typically the goal in these problems is easy to encourage or discourage the spatial spread of something, and often at the same time.",
            "So we might be wanting to encourage the spread of an of an endangered species at the same time.",
            "May be managing the spread of fire, so some kinds of wildfires we want to prevent others.",
            "We want to encourage.",
            "We want to prevent the spread of diseases and of invasive species, and then we need to do this over long time horizons and so the resulting Markov decision problems are immense in the state in action space, and finally, the dynamics is typically only available via simulator.",
            "The other challenges that the data are extremely noisy, heterogeneous and incomplete, and we need to learn a latent process model from them, and so I guess another concern here is that you know my attitude to latent variables.",
            "Until I started working on this is.",
            "Oh, latent variables are modeling convenience.",
            "They're like our clusters or or you know it.",
            "We're just doing predictions so we don't really care what they are.",
            "But you really can't test a hypothesis about bird migration unless you can reconstruct the latent bird flow, and so suddenly I'm carrying about these things.",
            "And finally, I guess I think there's a big challenge for us to sort of extend our ideas from reinforcement learning where we're optimizing against a model that we're learning to to look at these much larger scale problems where we want to be.",
            "We want to optimize against the model that maybe we can in various areas because it was constructed from data.",
            "So we need to be robust to hit the model uncertainties robust to the unknown unknowns and also risk sensitive.",
            "So we really it's no good optimizing the expected population size of a species if there's a non non zero or non trivial probability that it's going to go extinct.",
            "So you really want something that's sensitive to downside risk of catastrophe.",
            "So I hope I've convinced you that there are lots of opportunities for computer science and machine learning to contribute to sustainable ecosystem management, and also that it's not a matter of applying our existing tools.",
            "We really need to develop a set of new tools to solve these problems.",
            "So if you want to learn more, as I mentioned, we have this joint project with Cornell that's led by Carla Gomez and our website iscomputationalhyphensustainability.org.",
            "And so let me close by thanking the various people.",

            "Execution and optimization.",
            "I guess my first thought was you were going to do policy execution of like laws and and items like that and when you talked about what you were doing, that last example is this kind of a budget constraint optimization and I'm just wondering if you thought about that sort of higher level of optimization even beyond just you know one particular stream too.",
            "To some sort of policy execution, a lot of this in the area that I work in is done by the EPA, and so my question was, have you been working with government institutions on this, have you gone with these models to those types of institutions?",
            "It just some thoughts.",
            "So yes, on this invasive species problem we have a few Contacts in Bureau of Land Management.",
            "The area where we have the closest contact to people who actually execute policies is.",
            "With the US Forest Service, and so we're looking at the problem of wildfire management in Eastern Oregon and there the fire managers are actually former students of one over the collaborators, so we have some leverage over them, but they have the legal authority to do these actions.",
            "The problem is, they don't.",
            "They need more help convincing the stakeholders mean if you, for instance, in their case, the question is given and ignited fire by lightning, should I let it burn or should I suppress it?",
            "And historically, we've suppressed everything but, but starting in the 70s, the law was passed to say that it would be OK to let these fires burn, or even to to light fires.",
            "But it's a career ending mistake.",
            "If you fire gets out of control, it's a politically so dangerous that I think they need models and visualizations and so on, where we can convince the various stakeholders that it would be OK and and especially ones that are sensitive to the downside risk of the fire getting out of control.",
            "But we have a long way to go to really get these policies taken up.",
            "By these organizations.",
