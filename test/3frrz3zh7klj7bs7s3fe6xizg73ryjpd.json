            "So this is an hour long session in the program, but don't be scared, it will be just a few slides and then most of the session will be devoted to a hand zone to demo ING and hands-on session with the actual platform.",

            "I can say for start that this platform also relates to the presentation we had right before lunch.",
            "So in this presentation there were several issues raised several requirements for what the platform would need to support, and I can see several connections to that platform in that talk.",
            "For instance, our platform targets life longer learning primary, so it's not so much for.",

            "It has personalization or adaptation features for the users.",
            "For instance, there is some adaptive learning support module that you will see later on, but at the same time it tries to keep the users within a community.",

            "But we collect and use and make available via platform content from multiple sources.",
            "So as you will see again later on we have content from YouTube and other similar sources or the web and social media.",
            "We have content that comes from videolectures.net, so more curated content and we also have content that is exclusive to our platform because it comes from a publisher that has allowed as a ladder.",
