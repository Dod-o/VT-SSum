            "Supplying this kind of uniform interface to these reasoning engines, we allow developers to more easily reuse their existing real world data set and ruleset to benchmark all sorts of reasoning engine.",

            "In this case, you continuously store collected facts so you and your blood pressure heart rate during the day symptoms you might be having then afterwards, or in the context of a clinical decision support system at least, and then after a certain time span X is elapsed, you apply reasoning each time right?",
            "And this advantage of course is not very responsive.",

            "Again, in the clinical setting, some historical data, for instance, clinical measurements.",
            "Then after each new fact is added like a new blood pressure or heart rate and also on startup time.",
            "Once you apply reasoning right, which of course makes the system more responsive.",
            "Requires keeping the engine consistent continuously in memory, right?",
            "So that has this kind of consistent memory load.",
