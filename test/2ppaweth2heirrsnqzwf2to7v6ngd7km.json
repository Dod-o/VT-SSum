            "Well, it's not very sophisticated magic, but it's very supportive to the user and what you can see is that it now detects many things in the in the text.",

            "So since it already has a lot of meetings and they're already classified as meeting, it can then automatically derived from the structure of this text that this could also be a meeting, and it recommends it to me in by clicking on the plus, I can simply confirm it.",
            "And then also the system is automatically trained further.",
            "Now it recognized also some entities.",
            "For example it recognized.",

            "I can even have some tag recommendations.",
            "They have also been.",
            "Well, it's not layout properly, but it applies the same information extraction techniques for tagging.",
            "And then I click on save and all this information is saved.",
            "And on meta data, what is actually hidden is the RDF meta data that is associated with a certain piece of with a certain resource in the system.",
            "So when I click here I see all the RDF data type and annotation properties and what you can see now.",
            "It already contains the city.",
            "It already contains the street in the country here.",
            "And what you have here in the tabs is actually what we call perspective.",
            "So by default it's two perspectives enabled, the default one to display the content and the meter data one to display this kind of tabular meter data.",
            "Now I go back to default and then I will just add some additional perspectives into perspective.",
            "Is a certain kind of viewpoint on content because content can be used in different contexts and viewpoints.",
            "I choose here because it's a meeting.",

            "But we think that our system goes beyond semantic forms in many ways.",
            "I now edit this.",
            "And it automatically fills in all the metadata here already.",
            "And I say OK now it's the wrong wrong number.",
            "It wasn't 3 actually.",
            "Now enter also the Postal code and I click on Geo locate here to move it a bit and I click on save and installed.",
            "And now you will see something that I find very nice because what is very important you have always around content you have textual content which is for humans.",
            "It's called the eyeball web sometimes and then you have.",
            "Non textual data content that is meant for machines and in kivy both things are synchronized.",
            "If I now click on default.",
            "You will see the content has been updated also to carry the new.",
            "Street number here, and this is because content meta data is synchronized.",
            "They can even go here again and then change it here.",
            "Click on edit.",
            "Where's the street number here?",
            "No, I say no.",
            "It's not free, it's 7.",
            "Updated and I go to default and.",
            "I have to go and view because the edit editor caches so it's not updated here, but you will see it here and it's even in the location from now.",
            "So it's all synchronized.",
            "Now what happened also in the background, kivy contains another semantic component which is a rule based reasoner.",
            "So we're using.",
            "We deliberately deliberately said our reasoning description logics are not the right thing to do in such a system.",
            "What we need is a rule based system, a simple one that allows us to derive new knowledge and what it does.",
            "In this case, it's a very simple rule.",
            "It implements RDF's reasoning instance reasoning ended.",
            "Also, we added a user defined role rule that says a meeting is located meeting.",
            "If it has a latitude and longitude and you can see it here, it has been the type has already been added.",
            "It's called located meeting here and actually if I have the mouse over it, it's it's a really nice feature because it even contains the explanations why certain inference has been made.",
            "The visualization is not yet so nice, but you can see that this resources are located meeting 'cause this resource is also a meeting and this resource has a latitude and these resources along a tude.",
            "And there's a rule called located message rule.",
            "Now I can go to the.",
            "The admin interface and here see the visit.",
            "Krishna configure Risner and in the in the reason that you can get some statistics first about the reasoning and you have different rulesets programs one for our RL we have.",
            "This one is the one we have been just using and it contains a rule that is called located message rule and it says exactly this.",
            "So if something is a meeting and this something also has a latitude and this something also has a longitude then it's also located meeting.",
            "It's very simple.",
            "Kind of rule based reasoning, data look style, but it's much more powerful in such a scenario than oil based reasoning.",
            "OK, no.",
            "How to use this?",
            "All this information I showed you that we can have different perspectives on it.",
            "There's even an even perspective.",
            "I think you trust me that I can enter dates there, but what is now really nice is since I have all this data with the content, I can do a lot of interesting things with the content and I told you it's not only about a wiki, Kiwis, a platform for building semantic social software applications and we have built another one and this one is called tag it.",
            "And if I go to tag it take it was actually meant as a platform for geolocating news articles of Salzburg.",
            "But it can equally be used to displaying any other kinds of content that has Geo information attached.",
            "And we have here now the selection of located meetings and if I go here and have the mouse over it, it's the release planning meeting.",
            "And actually this is a kind of faceted search with a different user interface.",
            "In the first set that is enabled to use located meeting and I can click here and again get the Kiwi release planning meeting with all the information that I have.",
            "I can have other meetings on the map as well.",

            "So the relations between the pictures and the content.",
            "I can search here for example for all of them, and then it displays all the meetings that we had.",
            "In that we entered into the demo system, so we had one break.",
            "We had one Stockholm and you can display them in the same way.",
            "No, it can go back just just to give you an impression how this can look like.",

            "We have mediator, which is an idea management prototype for experimenting how such a system can be used to collect ideas in innovation management.",
            "And there's also some other applications.",
            "One is for Art is an art portal where people can browse pieces of art.",
            "Another one is in elearning platform that I didn't actually really see because it's a community contributed project.",
            "Now what we can also do with this information is search give you offers a powerful search functionality and effect.",
            "For example search for Kiwi.",
            "It displays me all search results almost in an instant and what it immediately offers is faceting and faceting can be done over some predefined things like text types, persons, but I can also add arbitrary facets that relate to RDF properties.",
            "So for example I won't show it now because it takes a long time, but.",
            "For example, if you have pictures with EXIF information, you confess it on the aperture value, or you confess it over the time that they have been created on.",
            "I told you that key also contains personalization.",
            "You can for example see it here in the personalized search and the person was a personalized search.",
            "Takes into account my tagging information so when I click now on personalized search, it will rearrange the search results in a way that is more appropriate to my personal preferences.",
